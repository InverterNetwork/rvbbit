     "A high-definition, vivid, 16:9 stylized illustration of a post-snowfall New England town in America, adopting elements from traditional and futuristic cyberpunk aesthetics. The scene exudes gritty charm, enveloped in snow and building illuminations filtering gentle pink and neon light blue hues. On the left side of the frame, an attractive Irish woman in her early thirties, full and pouty lips with the lower one being noticeable, and a slightly upturned nose carries a pleased yet seductive expression. She has wet long hair due to accumulated snow, enhancing the intensity of the snowfall. Her body canvas is inked with intricate Celtic-style tattoos showcasing rabbits and wilderness scenes on her neck, collarbone, and shoulders. Pre-dawn tranquility wraps the setting, complementing the fusion between the natural and technologically enhanced world. The rising sunlight reflects off her voluptuous and robust figure, adorning a choker ribbon and a lengthy necklace, reminiscent of burlesque fashion."}]}},

   "A high-definition, hyperreal, vivid 16:9 highly stylized & exaggerated illustration of a New England scene in America, just before dawn during a heavy snowstorm, blending traditional and cyberpunk elements. The scene carries a slightly gritty atmosphere, with the town blanketed in snow and buildings emitting gentle pink and neon light blue illuminations. On the left side of the frame, a young and beautiful Irish woman, clearly in her early 30s, with full pouty lips (the bottom one being prominent) and a slightly upturned nose, offers a pleased yet sultry expression on her large mouth - buxom and robust. Pin-up. Her long hair, slightly dampened with snow accumulated on it and her face, amplifies the intensity of the snowfall. She is adorned with intricate Celtic-style tattoos of rabbits and wilderness over her neck, collarbone, and shoulders. The pre-dawn light instills a serene yet enigmatic ambiance to the scene, emphasizing the synergy between the natural world and technological influence. As the sun rises, its light gleams off her ample and full body radiantly.\nShe is very buxom, robust, hyper curvaceous. She wears a choker ribbon and a long necklace. Burlesque.\n",
