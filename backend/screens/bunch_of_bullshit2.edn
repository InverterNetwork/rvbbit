Doris Lake is roughly a mile and a half hike from the resort of Mono.  Nothing unusual was happening and then out of nowhere, we heard a scream come from across the lake and up in the Mountians.  There were no people or animals that we could see anywhere.  We were in the proverbial wilderness.  My brother and I looked at each other, and unable to readily discern what we were hearing we continued to fish.  I did say to him, if I hear that again I am out of here. Well, a minute or so later, the same scream.  The three of us immediately reeled in and began to run all the way back to the resort, without stopping.  <BR><BR>I have listened to various recordings of alleged Bigfoot, and I am struck by how similar these recordings are to the scream that we heard.

So....what could it be?<BR><BR>Note:  my brother and sister worked for several years at Mono Hot Springs.  My sisters good friend who worked their as well had a horse which she kept in the summer time at the springs. While riding in the back country, she claims to have seen Bigfoot walking through a meadow below a bluff she was riding atop.    " 1, " My friend Greg and I had been fishing the San Juaquin river just below Florence Lake until about 6:30 or 7:00 pm.  As we live in Clovis Ca. appoximately 70 miles away, we had decided we would just camp up there for the night.  Kaiser Pass road is a narrow one lane road that traverses some very rugged area.  It takes almost 2 hours to travel the 20 miles back to state highway 168 at Huntington Lake.  So it is about a three and a half hour trip home.  A trip that niether of us wanted to drive after a long day fishing, especially at night.  As the area we were fishing in is notoriously bad for bears, we decided to drive to a camp spot that we were both familiar with just back up the way From Florence Lake.  The camp spot is not in a campground, and is just a single spot off to the side of the road.  But it is a well used spot by many people.  We set up camp, had dinner, and had just sat down next to the campfire.  The light of day was almost totally gone.  We were sitting across from one another as we had both been taught to do when in the wilderness, so you can see if any animals are coming up from behind the other person. Gregs back was to the car and the road.  My back was to a low rising granite out cropping, almost a dome like shaped out cropping that is flat on top.  about 50 yards beyond that is a rather steep dirt ledge that goes up maybe another 25 feet above where we were sitting.  I heard a noise that sounded like a horn on a train passing somewhere in the distance.  I even said to Greg, do you here that train in the distance.  he said yes , he heard it.  We continued to hear it for a while, when suddenly it dawned on both of us that we were at 9000 feet in elevation, and there are no trains for about 70 miles.  Now we were curious about the sound.  And that is how I would best describe it, as the horn on a train in the distance.  It was not an owl, I have heard many owls.  As we continued to listen, it became closer, and became clear that it was over or on the ledge behind me.  I moved to the car, and grabbed a 12 guage shotgun.  The last time we heard it, it was extremely close to us, but still had that low mono toned almost horn like sound.  Not knowing what we were dealing with, and not wanting to shoot someone or something, we called out a warning that we had a gun, just incase it was someone playing a prank.  We did not hear the sound again.  However, as we were both looking out toward the granite out cropping, and the ledge where the sound was coming from, we both turned and looked at each other at the very same time to ask if the other had just seen the same thing.  We had, a pair of eyes glowing in the distance.  Almost like cat eyes, but not yellow like cat eyes, they were more silver, or white.  We only saw them for a second.  Still not wanting to shoot at what I couldn''t see, I fired a warning shot in the air.  I didn''t here or see anything after that, however, Greg insists he saw the eyes again, even after I fired the shot. Not wanting to find out what isn''t afraid of a twelve guage, Greg  threw all of our camping gear in the car as fast as he could while I stood guard with the gun.   We dumped our entire jug of water on the fire, got in the car and drove all the way home.  Niether of us said a word until we got back to town.  I have been all over the mountains up in that area, and have been camping and four wheeling into the back country since I was a kid.  That part of the Sierras is like my backyard to me, and I had never experienced anything like that.  Bears, mountain lions, the rare badger sighting, but nothing like that.    " 1, " It was late October 2006. My hunting partner and I were deer hunting near Heart Lake, which is located off the John Muir Trail behind Florence Lake.  We''d been back there for almost a week looking for the elusive Big Daddy Buck that we''ve hunted religiously for the last three years. We were high up on this ridge just before nightfall.  We were hiking back to our base camp and heard a loud bellowing howl that sent a shiver down our spines.  We looked at each other with confused looks on our faces, not knowing what that sound was.  We decided to hurry back to camp, but we heard another howl, but closer this time.  We saw Big Daddy Buck running down the opposite ridge side, and busting through brush, not caring if hunters spotted him.  Then again, we heard that bellowing howl, and saw on top of the ridge a dark silhouette that looked like a bear standing on its hind feet.  I brought my rifle scope to my eye to take aim on this so-called bear.  As I looked through the scope, I realized it was no bear.  I thought it could have been a really tall man in some kind of camouflage suit, but it looked like no man that I have ever seen.  It ran down the hill and disappeared into the brush, like it was chasing the deer.  So we decided to go and track down this creature.  Once we arrived at where it was standing, there was a footprint in the dirt that made my footprint look like a child''s footprint.  It was four times the size of mine. <BR><BR>We never saw the creature again and never heard that howl, but then again, I''ve never gone back since then." 1}, :cardinality 100}, :environment {:data-type "string", :distinct 17, :group-by? true, :commons {"Doris Lake in the John Muir Wilderness" 1, "mostly farm land, no houses for about 7 miles or so. scattered trees. vineyards. nothing real dense. river flows pretty good on this part." 1, "Leading up to the area the ground was swampy like the ground was saturated with water, then it turned to very dense pine trees.

It was late afternoon when we noticed a strong odor that we thought might be elk so we headed east toward a small ridge hoping to find one on the other side.  As we got closer we heard the noise of rocks being banged together.  As we topped the ridge we saw a large dark brown animal squatting at the edge of a dry creek bed with it''s back toward us. It was banging 2 rocks together with it''s \"hands\" and making a grunting/growling noise each time the  rocks hit.<BR><BR>It seemed to sense our presence almost immediately and turned around and looked at us.  Then it quickly stood up and jumped across the creek in one motion.  I remember thinking \"nothing can move like that!\".  It ran up the slope on the north side of the creek bed at an angle and disappeared into the pine and aspen trees farther up the hill.  We could see it for about 50 feet before it was gone from sight.  It moved real quietly for something that big.<BR><BR>I estimate it''s height as 6''5''''.  It was covered with long dark brown hair that made me think of a yak.  It had a strong smell, at least there was a strong smell in the area that was like elk urine.<BR><BR>After we calmed down a bit, we went into the creek bed and found the 2 rocks which were chipped and broken.  We looked for other signs in that place but couldn''t find anything else." 1, " I was working in the northern part of New Mexico training to be a Wildland Fire Fighter. In September 2003 (maybe the second week of that month) I was dispatched with 22 other people to the Del Loma Fire in the Shasta/Trinity Forest area, the Northern part of California. Each Crew had about 20 people, our plane that left Albuquerque held 2 crews. For almost the whole two weeks, we were all on standby. On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire. It was close to sun down when, a couple of guys were amazed at something. I heard them from inside my tent, but just ignored the whole thing until one of my crew members came and pulled me out of my tent. <BR><BR>I had no idea what I was supposed to be looking at or for. He pointed across the river and I was in shock when he pointed out the biggest, hairiest mammal I had ever seen just walking along the river side minding his own business. It stopped and looked at us. The way he stood on his hind legs was like an ordinary human. He had dark, long hair and stood about 7ft tall with a muscular build. <BR><BR>At this point I was the 4th person standing there in amazement. Maybe about 5 minutes of watching him watch us, with more people coming out with flashlights (because the sun was still going down) he darted in to the trees. He was running, taking long strides, and was gone in about 3 seconds.....and was literally pushing trees out of his way (not breaking them, but  pushing them out of his way). The trees behind him on his path up the mountain were swaying back and forth. I was surprised to see to these trees moving because they are thick in width and very tall. <BR><BR>By this time it was dark but lit enough to see which way he was headed. Up the mountain a little, there was a clearing, where we spotted him again before he disappeared for good. He made no noise, no yelling or screaming. He was just as timid as can be.<BR><BR>I have heard many stories about Bigfoot, and known that they are real but when seeing one in real life....you get a sense of respect for them and just have that feeling that there is more to life than you know. <BR><BR><BR><BR>" 1}, :cardinality 99}, :environment {:data-type "string", :distinct 449, :group-by?

There was snow on the ground and it was freezing outside.  My mother has a habit of looking out the bathroom window early in the morning.  On this cold winter morning, with the landscaped dressed in a blanket of white and without any visible signs of being touched by human or animal footprints, she saw what looked like 3 very large humanoid footprints. It was so strange that my mother made me get up to take a look.  We put our coats on and went outside to investigate.  We couldn''t believe our eyes.  There in the snow were 3 very, very large humanoid footprints.  We couldn''t figure out where they came from or where they went.  It literally looked as it came from no where and went no where, because the footprints did not leave a trail.  The footprints were so large I could almost stand in it.  You could literally see the 5 toes with foot and toe imprints in the snow.  We couldn''t believe what we were seeing.  Who or what has a foot that big and who or what would be out in this weather barefooted.<BR><BR>" 1, " April 29 2006 about 630pm I just left the Livingston mall and was heading home but got all turned about since I don''t go up that way very often. Anyhow I was figuring that I was north of rt 78 and just kind of \"Lewis and Clarked\" it toward home via the mirror compass in my car and made the first left southbound that I could once I realized I was heading west and didn''t recognize any landmarks. <BR><BR>I turn down this road and notice some construction equipment not far off into the trees on the right side of the road. I was driving slower than normal being unfarmiliar with the area and since I kept peeking at the compass to make sure I was still southbound (looking back it must have been overcast since I would have just used the location of the sun as a reference to direction).<BR>As I was driving along I caught movement out of the corner of my eye and saw a young deer (judging by size) bolt out of the trees across the road from left to right about 100-200 feet in front of my car. I just took my foot off the gas and didn''t need to brake, then I looked left for followers and saw what appeard to be a hunter in a dark colored ghillie suit burst from the trees after the deer. I couldnt make out any details of the face feet or hands but he/it was only around 6 feet tall or so and I''d estimate the low 200lb range but was unusually fast especially for someone dressed like that. The second thought in my head since I fish and shoot a bit was that it couldn''t possibly be legal to hunt around that area since its fairly close to residential zones. Then I noticed that the hunter had no weapons in his hands. I got up to the spot where they crossed and looked right and noticed that the biped (hunter) actually closed ground on the deer and was still in pursuit. I don''t know if the deer stopped to look back at some point as they some times do but this thing was in a full tilt sprint over what I would assume to be uneven ground and didn''t stumble once. I didn''t hear or smell anything since I had my roof up and AC & radio on at the time.

It was late afternoon when we noticed a strong odor that we thought might be elk so we headed east toward a small ridge hoping to find one on the other side.  As we got closer we heard the noise of rocks being banged together.  As we topped the ridge we saw a large dark brown animal squatting at the edge of a dry creek bed with it''s back toward us. It was banging 2 rocks together with it''s \"hands\" and making a grunting/growling noise each time the  rocks hit.<BR><BR>It seemed to sense our presence almost immediately and turned around and looked at us.  Then it quickly stood up and jumped across the creek in one motion.  I remember thinking \"nothing can move like that!\".  It ran up the slope on the north side of the creek bed at an angle and disappeared into the pine and aspen trees farther up the hill.  We could see it for about 50 feet before it was gone from sight.  It moved real quietly for something that big.<BR><BR>I estimate it''s height as 6''5''''.  It was covered with long dark brown hair that made me think of a yak.  It had a strong smell, at least there was a strong smell in the area that was like elk urine.<BR><BR>After we calmed down a bit, we went into the creek bed and found the 2 rocks which were chipped and broken.  We looked for other signs in that place but couldn''t find anything else." 1, " I was working in the northern part of New Mexico training to be a Wildland Fire Fighter. In September 2003 (maybe the second week of that month) I was dispatched with 22 other people to the Del Loma Fire in the Shasta/Trinity Forest area, the Northern part of California. Each Crew had about 20 people, our plane that left Albuquerque held 2 crews. For almost the whole two weeks, we were all on standby. On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire. It was close to sun down when, a couple of guys were amazed at something. I heard them from inside my tent, but just ignored the whole thing until one of my crew members came and pulled me out of my tent. <BR><BR>I had no idea what I was supposed to be looking at or for. He pointed across the river and I was in shock when he pointed out the biggest, hairiest mammal I had ever seen just walking along the river side minding his own business. It stopped and looked at us. The way he stood on his hind legs was like an ordinary human. He had dark, long hair and stood about 7ft tall with a muscular build. <BR><BR>At this point I was the 4th person standing there in amazement. Maybe about 5 minutes of watching him watch us, with more people coming out with flashlights (because the sun was still going down) he darted in to the trees. He was running, taking long strides, and was gone in about 3 seconds.....and was literally pushing trees out of his way (not breaking them, but  pushing them out of his way). The trees behind him on his path up the mountain were swaying back and forth. I was surprised to see to these trees moving because they are thick in width and very tall. <BR><BR>By this time it was dark but lit enough to see which way he was headed. Up the mountain a little, there was a clearing, where we spotted him again before he disappeared for good. He made no noise, no yelling or screaming. He was just as timid as can be.<BR><BR>I have heard many stories about Bigfoot, and known that they are real but when seeing one in real life....you get a sense of respect for them and just have that feeling that there is more to life than you know. <BR><BR><BR><BR>" 1}, :cardinality 99}, :environment {:data-type "string", :distinct 449, :group-by?

On this cold winter morning, with the landscaped dressed in a blanket of white and without any visible signs of being touched by human or animal footprints, she saw what looked like 3 very large humanoid footprints. It was so strange that my mother made me get up to take a look.  We put our coats on and went outside to investigate.  We couldn''t believe our eyes.  There in the snow were 3 very, very large humanoid footprints.  We couldn''t figure out where they came from or where they went.  It literally looked as it came from no where and went no where, because the footprints did not leave a trail.  The footprints were so large I could almost stand in it.  You could literally see the 5 toes with foot and toe imprints in the snow.  We couldn''t believe what we were seeing.

Anyhow I was figuring that I was north of rt 78 and just kind of \"Lewis and Clarked\" it toward home via the mirror compass in my car and made the first left southbound that I could once I realized I was heading west and didn''t recognize any landmarks. <BR><BR>I turn down this road and notice some construction equipment not far off into the trees on the right side of the road. I was driving slower than normal being unfarmiliar with the area and since I kept peeking at the compass to make sure I was still southbound (looking back it must have been overcast since I would have just used the location of the sun as a reference to direction).<BR>As I was driving along I caught movement out of the corner of my eye and saw a young deer (judging by size) bolt out of the trees across the road from left to right about 100-200 feet in front of my car. I just took my foot off the gas and didn''t need to brake, then I looked left for followers and saw what appeard to be a hunter in a dark colored ghillie suit burst from the trees after the deer. I couldnt make out any details of the face feet or hands but he/it was only around 6 feet tall or so and I''d estimate the low 200lb range but was unusually fast especially for someone dressed like that. The second thought in my head since I fish and shoot a bit was that it couldn''t possibly be legal to hunt around that area since its fairly close to residential zones. Then I noticed that the hunter had no weapons in his hands. I got up to the spot where they crossed and looked right and noticed that the biped (hunter) actually closed ground on the deer and was still in pursuit. I don''t know if the deer stopped to look back at some point as they some times do but this thing was in a full tilt sprint over what I would assume to be uneven ground and didn''t stumble once. I didn''t hear or smell anything since I had my roof up and AC & radio on at the time.

The police were called and a hunt for the window peaker insued.  An officer on the police force, saw a large man, over 7 ft. tall, run across the highway.  He notified the desk.  They searched.  Tracks were found. they were very large with a sizable stride. <BR><BR>La Crosse Wisconsin then turned into a  hot bed of bigfoot hunters.  A man from I think Colorado came to La Crosse to look at the prints. He said that what ever made them was not wearing a false shoe because of the distribution of the weight in the print cast as well as tracks that went down to the river.  If someone was running around with a red ape suite on they were crazy. It was deer season in Jackson County and over in LaCresent Minn. Want to die, put on a suite of hair and run around in areas where people are hunting.  Who knows what it was. No proof only the sighting by a policeman, woman, and the tracks. Heck they had dogs out..everything. Nothing was tracked down. Vanished into the Mississippi bottoms. <BR><BR>I have been down in the McGilvray Bottoms north of La Crosse, right on the Mississippi up by Trempealeau. I have hunted back in this large swamp for big swamp buck. When I get back in their  I have felt something with me. I felt it on several occasions. I walk, it walks ( and I know the difference between a deer and a person). I feel like something moves when I do. If I sit down for two to three hours, something moves around out there. Never find tracks. I have hunted for many years all over. I leave it at that. If their is something like a cleaver ape, it may travel along the Mississippi bottom land country. Its thick, swampy, and no one  goes there except to maybe hunt snakes, ducks, or deer. It is wet, thick and the Magilliary is where I would go if I wanted to stay out of sight, especially when hunting season starts. Thats when I have heard what ever it was. It stayed with me twice. I walk, it walks. I have never seen anything though nor found one print. Believe me, Ive looked.  Its Hunting season again in Wisconsin, Think like them. <BR>  <BR><BR>" 1, " A mexican brush picker in this area was picking brush to sell when he heard this sound from an old skid road as if something was making a lot of growls, squils and brush breaking so he thought he would find out what it was! The growling got real loud. He then he stepped up this side hill and on the other side Rodregies said he saw a bear, black in colour laying over a vinemaple and not moving.\" So he moved slowly closer when just in front of him about 50 feet away was this very large thing standing up. It was about 7 feet tall, dark brown in colour and it had it''s back to him so he got on his hands and knees and watched this thing called Bigfoot that he had heard about in this area. Rodregies said the creature just stopped what ever it was doing and turned quickly and looked at him with eyes of fire. He said they were very red like a devil and that''s when he ran to the truck screaming the devil is after him. The Bigfoot had red glowing eyes and the winess said he will never go back into the woods again. His boss took the crew out of the area because they are afraid of this Bigfoot. Rodregies wife called me and said her husband will not go to work and they are moving to another State but wanted to tell someone about it. She saw me on Evening Magazine, Kings Seattle, Washington show and got hold of me with the story. Her husband claimed there was blood everywhere and the Bigfoot had a large cut on it''s back and it was bleeding." 1, " The first incident occured on Monday night, 4 June 1973; the other two happened between 4 June and 8 June 1973. <BR><BR>In three separate incidents, three residents reported seeing and being chased by a musty-odored, red-eyed, human-sized creature or monster.
