      " My wife and I were in Broken Bow, OK on Sun. the 18th of March 2012. We live in Arkansas about 20 miles west, but on a whim decided to take a 2 hr detour north on HWY 259 and cut across Rich Mt. Rich Mt is the highest point in the Ouachita Mts. I had commented about how squatchy the area looked and my wife replied that we would not see one in the day time. Well, about 45 minutes later she saw one. We were about a mile south of Talimena Scenic By-Way on 259, right on the west end of Rich Mt. She said it was about 35-40 ft off the road walking behind a tree. She described it as being 9-10 ft tall with stringy hair of varying shades of brown. She noticed it was bipedal with long arms swinging in the usual ''squatchy'' way. She was very firm when I asked if perhaps it was a bear and said that she knew what she saw. As my luck goes, we were at a point where the road was hairpin curves with no shoulders and no way to turn around. I guess I''ll have to wait for my first sighting. One thing she mentioned was noticing the muscles in the arms and legs. If this was a man in a suit they went to some trouble to pull it off. "

      " hello. some time back i submitted a report about strange noises i and my family had been hearing over the years. i spoke with someone on the phone from bfro about it and informed him that my father had actually seen a bigfoot here in the past. well, much to my shock and horror i have seen one too. i was checking on my children in their bedroom last night at about 1:00 in the morning, when i saw the motion detection light we have mounted on the outside of the house go on. where my childrens bedroom is it is right against a hillside that leads to very dense woods. anything can walk out of the woods and onto a small porch that we have off of my childrens bedroom. well, anyhow as i was saying, i was checking on them and there is a window that you can look out onto this porch {it is on the second floor, but up against the woods} and also a door for access.when the light came on i instinctively looked over to the window because i knew whatever had set it off would be either there on that porch or in the woods. it goes off if a raccoon or a cat scurries by so itis not uncommon for this to occur. when i looked over to that window i could not breathe. all i could see was a massive, coal black, very shaggy haired creature standing there on two very bulky legs looking in the window at me. i felt very frightened, as this window is only about 6 feet from where my childrens beds are. i could not see anything but the two legs and the rear end of this thing because the window has a blind on it that was halfway down. it is one of those straw blinds that you can see through partially. with the light shining behind this thing i could make out the perfect outline of it''s upper body. i am about 5 feet tall and this thing was, i am guessing, about 8 feet tall because it towered over the window. it just stood there for a brief moment and then went in the direction of the woods. i was too scared to go over to the window and look and see where it went. i took my children into my bedroom last night and i laid awake in fear all night.what i keep remembering is the muscles and the bulk in the legs. the rear end {the butt} also was quite muscular. and that ratty coal black fur. there was no smell at all and it made no noise. i am sure that the light coming on suddenly spooked it, but i got the impression that it was curious as to what was inside my home. it gives me the shakes to think of it. it was a cold winter night last night, but the ground was still muddy so i mustered up some courage this morning and went looking for tracks.i found some long slide marks on the hillside as if something had slid down the mud. no distinct footprints though."

     {" April 29 2006 about 630pm I just left the Livingston mall and was heading home but got all turned about since I don''t go up that way very often. Anyhow I was figuring that I was north of rt 78 and just kind of \"Lewis and Clarked\" it toward home via the mirror compass in my car and made the first left southbound that I could once I realized I was heading west and didn''t recognize any landmarks. <BR><BR>I turn down this road and notice some construction equipment not far off into the trees on the right side of the road. I was driving slower than normal being unfarmiliar with the area and since I kept peeking at the compass to make sure I was still southbound (looking back it must have been overcast since I would have just used the location of the sun as a reference to direction).<BR>As I was driving along I caught movement out of the corner of my eye and saw a young deer (judging by size) bolt out of the trees across the road from left to right about 100-200 feet in front of my car. I just took my foot off the gas and didn''t need to brake, then I looked left for followers and saw what appeard to be a hunter in a dark colored ghillie suit burst from the trees after the deer. I couldnt make out any details of the face feet or hands but he/it was only around 6 feet tall or so and I''d estimate the low 200lb range but was unusually fast especially for someone dressed like that. The second thought in my head since I fish and shoot a bit was that it couldn''t possibly be legal to hunt around that area since its fairly close to residential zones. Then I noticed that the hunter had no weapons in his hands. I got up to the spot where they crossed and looked right and noticed that the biped (hunter) actually closed ground on the deer and was still in pursuit. I don''t know if the deer stopped to look back at some point as they some times do but this thing was in a full tilt sprint over what I would assume to be uneven ground and didn''t stumble once. I didn''t hear or smell anything since I had my roof up and AC & radio on at the time. All of this happened I would estimate in less than 20 seconds total."

      " In one part of Bearbrook State Park is the Girl Scout Day Camp location. Across the street from New Rye Rd is the Camping Museum & the Snowmobile Museum. There used to be a nature museum. If you keep going straight on that dirt path, you wind yourself up into the Girl Scout Campground. It was a 2 week event. The older campers were allowed to have a single overnight in the last few days. It was ''67/''68, late July. There were 3, 5-person tents, I was a senior and in the tent closest to the woods. The evening was spent cooking hotdogs & hamburgers & marshmallows & sa''mores with lots of singing laughing & screaming. We all retired around 10 pm. In the middle of the night, around 1 or 2 am, I was woken by something softly grunting & pushing down on the top of the tent. We have racoons but no bears in (I get the irony) Bear Brook State Park. The other girls in my tent were trying to stay quiet, but still panicking not so quietly. I said \" it''s just one of the other girls.\" I am a camper since age 9 with a father who was a practical joker. So I said loudly \"That''s not how you do it. This is how it is done\" & I dug my nails into the canvas & making a roaring growling sound clawed down the canvas hard & fast & hit something soft but solid on the outside of the cloth. I was picturing a man''s hand/fist kind of like knuckles???. There was a loud grunt/growl & crashing away from us through the underbrush just on the other side of the tent. Now the girls in my tent are screaming hysterically about bears, The rest of the campers are opening my tent and all pandemonium broke loose. No-one admitted to playing a prank. & the leaders in the other 2 tents all day insisted everyone was accounted for & no one had left the tents not even a potty run. There was a funky smell though, that no-one could recognize. The park rangers swore there were none in the area, they were all up north for the summer. We had never heard of bigfoot, I fear I am repeating myself, so didn''t even know such a thing existed. So, unexplainable incident, that with hindsight, I am thinking, could it have been??? The entire area, for square miles, has always been swarming w/ deer, even still, today."

      " Neighbors dogs started becoming increasingly loud/threatening barking...went outside of my home, heard at a distance of approx. 1/2 mile a series of howls...start low and quickly rise to a scream. Incredible lung capacity! Every 5 seconds or so it would repeat. It appoached from the river (got louder)...moved west...still howling...then quickly moved south/back from the river up the terain....howling as it retreated..untill it wasn''t discernable.<BR>I''ve hunted with friends in the Colorado Rocky''s for black bear, elk...have heard their death throws. . .and I''ve NEVER HEARD ANYTHING LIKE THIS IN MY LIFE."

      " This was told to me from a neighbor which showed me a cast of a foot print which was big(didn''t measure it)I was living in Edgewood at the time, Maryland, about 15mis. away or so from where it happened.The people had dogs getting into thier trash and the owner bought a 22 rifle to get the dogs as he put it. He has a cement pad about 10 by 6 ft with a fence 6ft high around three sides of it. The trash cans were inside the fence.On night he heard noises out side,he got his rifle and looked out back.The porch light showed nothing near the trash cans but outside the fence he could see a shape of something so he shot up in the air.The animal ,which he could only describe as a big ape,got up and he could see it''s shouders and head above the fence.It took off as it rose up turning back towards the woods in a hurry.It tore up freshly planted bushes in it''s path. The ground left  no tracks other then in the soft dirt around the bushes.That''s the plaster cast the neighbor showed me.He gave it to the neighbor because he decided he didn''t believe in what he saw and didn''t want to be haunted by the sighting.They had the police there but I guess he made sure it was kept out of the papers.He just didn''t want his name out there. <BR>"

   " Whitehall is a small town with little to do for teenagers.  Driving all the back roads was one of the past times of choice.  Late one night a girlfriend and I drove out to East Bay and stopped to talk for a while.<BR><BR>After a few moments spent parked near the bridge, I saw what looked to be a man walking accross the marshy area to our left.  The distance, I am assuming, was about 200 to 300 yards.  This I gauged by seeing a fence line at that distance. At the time my tested vision was 20/10 (documented). <BR><BR>We both watched as this man approached the fence line.  He cleared it without stopping.  Simply stepped over it as if it were a low stool.  Knowing that the snow was not that deep or that hard to support a man of his apparent size, and that it was highly unlikely for anyone to be out on the marshes at that time of night, I stepped out of the car to get a better look.<BR><BR>As soon as I had gotten out of the car, the man changed course and began heading straight toward us.  I closed the car door to cancel the interior light, and prevent showing my location.  At this point the man broke into a run.  His speed was incredible.  He closed the distance between us very quickly.  My girlfriend was screaming for me to get back into the car at this point.<BR><BR>I got back into the car, and she drove back over the bridge into NYS.  As we went, I looked behind us and saw that we were being pursued, although we were building a gap.  As soon as we returned to hardtop road, he broke off pusuit and ran back into the forest near the bridge.<BR><BR>We returned to town and never spoke of this incident to anyone other than two trusted friends.  I have since told friends and relatives that I saw \"something\" out there but could not say that it was any animal I had ever seen, nor could it have been any man.<BR><BR>I should add that at that time I had spent 16 years working and playing outdoors.  I had encountered all of the major predators of our area, knew their habits and habitats.  I know that I did not mistake an animal for a humanoid creature that night.  <BR><BR>I will further add that I am now a Natural Resource Scientist with 16-years of experience studying and reporting information based on my observations and analysis.  I still cannot state with precision what it is I saw that night.",

    " I''d like to make a report, however it was years ago but I remember every part pretty well.<BR><BR>I told a few folks about this over the years and they think I was nuts. But doesn''t matter what they think. I was close enough to know what it was. I would say about less than 50 ft. Right in the middle of a fire road.<BR><BR>In December 1977, my dad, uncle and my dad''s other friends and myself went up to the cabin owned by a hunters club in Gardner, Mass. We went to spend the night, cook food and my dad and his friends like to play cards after eating supper. Myself and a friend used the snowmobile with a sled attached to the back, we took turns driving the ski doo around and the other would stand on the foot rest on the sled.<BR><BR>The area was in northern central Massachusetts, very close to New Hampshire boarder. The cabin is in Ashburnham Mass. It''s about 2.5 miles up a fire road called Old Colony Road. I remember it was a snowy winter that year. The area where we saw this thing was right on the edge of a swamp, old train tracks run right thru the area and crosses the fire road that we used to get to the cabin.<BR><BR>It was about 4 p.m. or so, it was just getting a little dark. My friend and I left the cabin with the snowmobile, he was driving first and I was on the foot rest on the sled. We left and came up to the swamp, crossed over the tracks and headed down the road about 50 ft or so. It was getting a little late and we decided to not go to far so we turned the sled around on the road. Had to pick it up because of the narrowness of the road. Once we turned it around it was my turn to drive. So now were facing the tracks and the swamp is on both sides of the road. the road goes right thru the swamp and the tracks cross right by the edge of the swamp.<BR><BR>At this point I looked behind me to see if my friend was on the sled and holding on, when I looked up I saw this creature walking on 2 legs like a human. He crossed right by the tracks at the edge of the swamp and crossed the road right in front of us. I remember it looking at us and I remember the arms swing clearly. Just like the pictures I have seen from your site. Very similar. Anyway, I remember the its size, that''s what was scarey, so large, I''d say about 7to 9 ft high, weight about 400 to 500 pounds. At least for something that size it would most likely be heavy. I know the woods there well. I''ve spent years in the military and hunt every year. I have been trained in tracking and survival in the woods so I know what I am saying and what I saw. But the thing took about 2 steps and he was across the road. All black hair, didn''t notice any smells, but I can tell you this. I won''t forget that day ever. It was cold anyway and with no breeze the smell of it wouldn''t travel far. My friend was shocked. He won''t even mention it when I see him these days. He told one person and they treated him like he was on drugs. So thats why I never wanted to tell to many people.<BR><BR>I wanted to say something about it now because I just say a program on TV the other night about bigfoot and the Kiamichi Mountians, I think in Oklahoma or somewhere out there.<BR><BR>I remember one other thing that might be relevant. That being noises I have been hearing over the years in the woods there. Something like a crying sound but so load it almost seemed as if it were close by. I think it was a ways away because when we heard the sounds it was late, about midnight. We sit by the fireplace outside the cabin sometimes late cooking steak or deer meat on the grill. Behind the cabin is a huge swamp area that goes up to Route 12 in Ashburnham, Mass. The swamp is down a bit behind the cabin. We find moose droppings back there and lots of tree scraps from deer.<BR><BR>I beleive there passing thru that area at times. Those sounds I heard were never heard there before and I don''t hear them now when I go up there. Every now and then they seem to come back, but only when were outside sitting by the fire. Strange indeed. These woods go far as well and you could easily travel them and end up in New Hampshire or further without seeing a house.<BR><BR>As time goes by and the more I read about what other folks saw and the similarities between each story I''m more wanting to do some of my own investigating, but its very scary out there at night, especially for me. I carry a loaded .44 when I''m up there just because I have seen this thing up close enough to know what it was. No doubt in my mind. ",

    " Nov. 1984 between 12:00& 1:00AM The night my niece was born.There was a snow storm, my brother-in-law had a custom car and wanted to go home to milton to switch to his older car because of the sudden snow. My husband, brother-in-law, nephew 3yrs old & myself, drove from milton, we were headed to my house in Winooski. we got as far as Clochester when the snow got real bad and the car slid into a ditch,my newphew began to cry&scream, so we flaged down a truck to bring me&my nephew to my house to call a tow truck. I Left my husband&BROTHER-IN-LAW in Colchester. My husband said while they were waiting they started to hear noises in the woods, like trees breaking,than they heard something that was coming in thier dirction but the it was stomping on two legs they could breaking trees,coming closer,my husband is a hunter and he said you could tell it was walking on two legs they backed away from the side of the road to the other, couldnt run because the road was to slippery <BR>and they only had on sneakers. meanwhile it kept on getting closer, it was starting to part the trees when the tow truck came and they heard it running back into the woods breaking every thing in its path My husband was very scared , they both were &told me what had happened. I HALF believed them.<BR>The next day I drove threw the same place & looked around as I drove I saw fields and woods and thought that it looked to peaceful and really thought they were nuts. I HAD TO PICK UP MY HUSBAND IN MILTON. I had my daughters with me 10 and 13, I WAS PREGNANT at that time, anyway I got to Milton ,latter that night we headed back to Winooski, well wouldnt you know it, it started to snow realy hard like the night before and it was 12:00am. <BR><BR>We started to go threw the same spot as the night before and I started to tell my husband about me looking around earlier and that there was nothing ...... When there it was, it just crossed the road and started to go up a hill ,it was staring at us with one  foot on a wire fence holding the wire down with its arm and just staring at us, it was not brown but white with yellow dirty streaks and his eyes, oh how they scared me, they were reflecting a yellow/amber color  like the yellow on causion lights, huge man, it was at least 10 ft. tall arms very long ,his fur was long, on his face the only flesh part that didnt have fur was his eyes,upper cheeks. My husband started to slow down to get a better look, thats when I freaked out and started to hit my husband because I was so scared & my girls were screaming so we kept on going I just kept on thinking about its eyes and was afraid so we wandered if they know its there and we dont want to get shot looking. <BR>",

He called me up to tell me what he saw.  It turns out that on Feb. 6th I was on my way home on the same road in the same location.  It was around 10:20 pm and I was doing about 50 mph.  I saw something run across the road extremely fast.  It was around the same height as the hood of my car and it was black in color.  It ran so fast I didnt even need to hit the breaks.  Being an avid outdoors man I can usually identify animals, but I was not able to identify this one.  It was defiantly on two legs and covered in black hair.  No bear can run that fast and it defiantly wasnt a coyote or fox.  I drove home as fast as I could; I was shocked by the encounter and called my friend to tell him.

    " This sighting had happened when me and my girlfriend were driving on one of the dirt trails off Route 72.  We had just gotten on the trail and I wanted to stop for a second.  After being stopped for a few minutes, I looked up and noticed my girlfriend looked like she had just seen a ghost.  She said that she just saw something tall and light brown walk across the road we were on.  So I said it was probably just a deer or something.  <BR><BR>I got out and looked around, and I saw some bushes moving and heard some rustling.  As soon as I turned my head I saw this face of an animal about 6 feet high looking straight at me through this big pile of brush.  The face itself was black but the hair was a dark sandy to light brown color.  It looked like the face of an ape.  The hair on the top of its head was somewhat long.<BR><BR>After looking at it for a few seconds I shook my head to see if i had seen what I thought I had, while I was doing so the animal had run away.  I saw it running for a second but then I turned back  to my car and got in.  Once I was in I asked her what she thought she saw.  She said that it was the same thing she had seen when we went camping six months prior to this.  <BR><BR>We went camping near Tuckerton but we had taken a detour to Apple Pie Hill.  There is a ranger lookout tower there, so went to the top and she looked down and said what the hell is that.  I pointed my flashlight in the direction but didn''t see anything.  She said she saw something running in front of the tower and it looked like the same thing she had seen. But once I had gotten back into my car I looked around for it again but didn''t see it.  So I put my window down and started driving, I could hear something running toward my car so I stopped and turned off my car again.  I still heard something coming my way, it sounded like a human or something running on two feet as opposed to a animal on 4 feet galloping through the woods.

    " It was in the afternoon on a snowy winter day.1985. My friend and I decided to go for a winter drive(which was very common for me when it snows).We ended up at the entrance to \"Ice Cave Mountain\". Of course the attraction was closed. But we wanted to go for a winter walk and thought it would be pretty secenery in the untouched snow covered grounds.<BR>We stepped over the gate and began to walk the driveway towards the woods. We were talking with eachother in normal voice tones. The snow was about shin deep so as we walked, we were looking towards the ground to step through the snow as we go. <BR>As we approached the woods, we both looked toward the woods to see the snow covered trees and scenery, when all of a sudden, it took us by surprise as much as we took him by surprise.<BR>It stopped in its tracks to look at us. It was if it froze in place. (You see, these grounds are not occupied at all during the winter, so it was totally unusual for us to be there)It looked at us as we were frozen in our tracks staring back at it. It was about 150 feet from us. It was very large with brown fur/hair all over it''s body. It was absolutely human looking. It was walking upright just like humans walk. When it looked at us, it didn''t react in any deffensive way. It just waited a moment or two as if it was waiting to see what we were gonna do.<BR>When I was finally able to speek, I asked my friend if she sees what I see. And with that movenment, it seemed to have been frightened by us and started to walk away very fast,but it didn''t run. It just had a very long stride. It looked back at us again while it was leaving.<BR>Now mind you, we were the only people in the area. But we were curious and stupid.We decided to follow it. But then again we were very scared. We attempted to try and find footprints but were unable to. Maybe because we were too scared to look properly.<BR>I know what I saw.

    " Whitehall is a small town with little to do for teenagers.  Driving all the back roads was one of the past times of choice.  Late one night a girlfriend and I drove out to East Bay and stopped to talk for a while.<BR><BR>After a few moments spent parked near the bridge, I saw what looked to be a man walking accross the marshy area to our left.  The distance, I am assuming, was about 200 to 300 yards.  This I gauged by seeing a fence line at that distance. At the time my tested vision was 20/10 (documented). <BR><BR>We both watched as this man approached the fence line.  He cleared it without stopping.  Simply stepped over it as if it were a low stool.  Knowing that the snow was not that deep or that hard to support a man of his apparent size, and that it was highly unlikely for anyone to be out on the marshes at that time of night, I stepped out of the car to get a better look.<BR><BR>As soon as I had gotten out of the car, the man changed course and began heading straight toward us.  I closed the car door to cancel the interior light, and prevent showing my location.  At this point the man broke into a run.  His speed was incredible.  He closed the distance between us very quickly.  My girlfriend was screaming for me to get back into the car at this point.<BR><BR>I got back into the car, and she drove back over the bridge into NYS.  As we went, I looked behind us and saw that we were being pursued, although we were building a gap.  As soon as we returned to hardtop road, he broke off pusuit and ran back into the forest near the bridge.<BR><BR>We returned to town and never spoke of this incident to anyone other than two trusted friends.  I have since told friends and relatives that I saw \"something\" out there but could not say that it was any animal I had ever seen, nor could it have been any man.<BR><BR>I should add that at that time I had spent 16 years working and playing outdoors.  I had encountered all of the major predators of our area, knew their habits and habitats.  I know that I did not mistake an animal for a humanoid creature that night.  <BR><BR>I will further add that I am now a Natural Resource Scientist with 16-years of experience studying and reporting information based on my observations and analysis.  I still cannot state with precision what it is I saw that night.",

    " My wife and I have had our farm near Treadwell, NY in Delaware County since the summer of 2001. The farm is above 130 mostly wooded acres (I don''t want to give the exact number of acres to avoid someone figuring out which one it is), with about 30 acres of fields, with a few trails throughout the woods. The property is bordered by probably 2,000 or more acres of continuous woods (privately owned), and countless more acres of woods and fields that lead all the way up to Canada by just crossing dirt roads, except for one major highway (88). I have had a fascination for Bigfoot since I was young, and read about reported sightings, etc., so I am keen to notice things that could be attributed to these possible creatures others might not notice. I say possible creatures because even though I have a strong feeling they exist, I have not seen one with my own eyes. The first thing that happened was not long after we got our place. We were sitting around a campfire we made not far from the house, when we began to hear the sound of wood being pounded against wood coming from what seemed to be our woods up on the hill. The distance up to those particular woods is probably 300 yards or more, but this sound was clear and strong. I told my wife what I thought it could be and she told me she didnt want to hear anymore about it because it frightened her. There was no other explanation that could explain that distinct sound to me though. I tried to duplicate the sound in the woods myself, but could get nowhere near the resonance that must have been produced to carry the distance I think we heard it from. On another occasion I took our dog out for his nightly walk, and heard a tremendous short howl/scream/yelp with a whole lot of modulation. It gave me a chill down my spine. It was just a huge sound. We have coyotes all around here and I have heard them make some strange sounds, but I have never heard that sound from a coyote. Whatever made that sound I would imagine had to be a pretty big animal. It did not seem far away either, so after shinning the flashlight along the edge of the woods, I hightailed back to the house checking over my shoulder often. Perhaps along this same line, my wife was out with the dog one early evening in the field, and this is the mildest dog you will ever encounter, it has only ever growled while asleep and chasing something in its dreams. My wife told me that she had never seen our dog behave this way, and it doesnt even pay attention to deer when it sees them anymore because it sees them so often. The dog was looking intently at something along the wood line and growling. My wife could see nothing, but the dog saw something that scared it. It may have been a bear, as I have seen tracks and sign occasionally? The last incident, and probably the most convincing to me are the tracks that we saw in our woods this past winter (2004). We have never been able to get into our woods in the winter because the snow has always been too deep, and the hill to those particular woods to steep. The snowshoes that we tried in the past just sunk in the powdery snow. We tried a new type on a snow with an ice crust and we were able to get into the woods for quite a ways. We came across a trail of two pairs of tracks going in a couple of different directions and meeting up again a hundred yards or so later that no humans could have made. I at first I thought the tracks could have been made by deer leaping, but the tracks appeared to be a two legged stride with one foot pointing a little right and one a little left alternating perfectly. I am 6 feet tall, and I took my snowshoes off to see what king of stride I could make, and I was about a foot or two short of reaching the stride of these prints. The prints were pretty old as they had been snowed on, so I couldnt see much, and tried to feel for features like toes, but could not say for sure that I felt any. They were quite long, but the snow could have melted to make them bigger? What struck us was the length of the stride though.<BR><BR>So, that is our experience to this point for what its worth. I only wanted to let you know that there could be something to these incidences. I would not dare ask my neighbors if they have had any strange thing happen, even though they are very good friends of ours. I find it ironic that they may have had more significant encounters and may be afraid to say anything to us about it. One neighbor did say they heard what sounded like a dear being attacked and screaming in the woods in the night. They have never heard anything like it, so that was their only explanation. One of them works for an environmental agency that I wont identify and spends a lot of time in the woods. <BR>",

The lane went through a large hedge row with a small stream in it. When we got to the other side we spot-lighted along the woods. About 75 to 100 yards there is an old spot they use to dump garbage.  There was something standing next to the old fridge. I have hunted these woods since I was a little boy and never had seen anything like this. Its belly was about the top of an almost 6 foot tall fridge. I know it was an animal because its eyes reflected in the spotlight. It looked almost like a bear standing on its hind feet but there is no bears in this part of the state. As we sat there trying to figure out what it was it started to turn and walk into the woods.

    "      In 1985, I was attending Indiana State University in Terre Haute, IN.  One Saturday morning I was travelling to Chicago to visit relatives. I was driving north on U.S. 41 and I looked to my right down into a small valley (more a depression in the land than a valley) with a small stream running through it. About 100-150 yards from the highway, I saw a large dark-colored creature walking away from the road (to the east.) It was very broad and I could clearly see the creature''s arms swinging. My view of the bottom part of it was obscured by tall grass and I could only see the very tops of its legs. The head never turned at all. I saw this for 4-5 seconds before the trees on the north side of the depression obscured my view. There were also trees on the south side. My immediate thought was that I didn''t really see what I thought I did. I continued driving, unsure of what to do. After a few minutes, I turned around and drove back past where I had seen it (my view from this side of the highway was blocked), turned around again, drove to the bridge where the sighting occurred and stopped where I had originally seen it. There was nothing there at this time. Not being aware of any sasquatch sightings in this area (or the Midwest in general), and not knowing what else to do, I continued on to Chicago and didn''t think much more about it for many years.  <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>  ",

    " The sighting occurred awhile ago.  So long that I am not sure of the year, but I would guess Jan or Feb of 1998.  The reason I am reporting it now is because I was watching the History Channel, and the animal they displayed was very similar, with a few exceptions.  The hair was even over the body, the History Channel display was baggy at the ankles and narrow at the knees.  The eyes were definitely very red.  The time of the incident was approximately 1AM in the morning.  The importance is the animal was no more than 150 feet from me, and I stopped the car and the animal and I stared at each other for quite a long time, until I got tired and left the scene.<BR><BR>\tDetails:  My wife and I were returning home from a friends home in Gettysburg PA along Route 116 between Gettysburg and Fairfield.  In front in my headlights, I saw this animal step over a fence and walk across the road, West to East.  The animal stopped in the middle of the field and looked back at the car, and I stopped the car to observe.<BR><BR>\tThe reason this was not reported sooner is because we did not know how to report the event, and until reading your Web Page, I did not realize how prevalent the sightings are.<BR><BR> ",

    " Sighting was seen in 1991 in Blue Mountain Berks County PA.  State Game Land 110 I believe in early February.  I was grouse hunting on the top of the mountain, there was ten to twelve inches of snow with a half to one inch of ice on top of the snow.  It was very difficult to puncture your feet to walk through the snow and ice.  I shot my grouse, on top of the mountain about a half to 3/4 of a mile from where we came up to the top of the mountain.  I shot twice after my friend with me yelled grouse, I yelled I got it to my friend who then proceeded to walk up to me.  He was 75yds away and it took him about 15-20min to get up to me.  Then he walked a trail that went back to where the road starts at the top of the mountain.  I stood there for 15 min. as I heard my friend walking away from me,afer I could hear his footsteps no more, I turned the other direction and was looking at the side of the mountain that we came up.  I noticed a dark figure running along the ridge of the top of the mountain, for 50 to 100yds. it ran, there was an opening and it stoped.  Then it proceeded to run straight for me uphill and did not stop until it was about 40 to 50ft away from me.  It was not out of breath and did not make a sound and just stood there and looked at me for about 1-2min. and then walked away in the direction that it came from.  First of all in those conditions you could not run or barely walk in it.  It was hard to puncture the ice on top of the snow to walk let alone run.  It went through it like it wasn''t even there for 200yds and when it stopped 50ft away, you couldn''t even see it breath or hear it breathe.  He ran that distance, in about 1-3min maybe.  It scared the hell out of me i wasn''t sure what it was, until it stopped right in front of me.  It found me I wasn''t looking for it.  And I can tell that when he stopped in the opening on the ridge that he can see blaze orange because he ran faster then straight for me after he seen me in my blaze orange one piece outfit.  He was there in no time at all, running uphill a 100 to 150yds.  He walked away and looked back at me once and then kept going.  He was all black, very long hair, it was hard to see his face through the hair.  Tall around 7-7 1/2ft 400-500lbs I thought. Very powerful animal seemed very intelligent because I think he heard the gunshots or the yelling and wanted to find who was making the noise on the mountain and came right to me.  I was scared at first and when it stopped, I put my shotgun right on it at 45-50ft and it didn''t even flinch it wasn''t scared and it just walked away.  My friend with me is 6''1 200lbs and when I told him what happened, he didn''t believe me but he tried to run on the road at the top of the mountain on level ground, flat, he took 3 steps and fell on his face.",

    " I was driving back from work late on Tuesday the 25th of February and I''ll never forget what I saw. As I was driving down Green Lane towards Levitown a giant creature that I can only describe as a Sasquatch. The creature was standing on two feet and had almost a human like form except for its nearly 9 foot stature. As it crossed in front of my car I could see it more clearly in my headlights, it was a very dark brown, but it was more like hair than fur which I found to be even stranger. It couldn''t have taken more than three steps to completely cross the road. As I swerved it was already nearly off the road all I could see though my drivers window were what seemed to be piercing blue eyes that seemed to glow. Though I could not differentiate if they were glowing or if it was a reflection of the moon. I haven''t been able to sleep much since, all I can think about is those piercing eyes. Once I found this website and read of the sightings, I knew I had to share what I saw. I''ve been looking online for another explanation, but I can''t find anything. ",

    " I was coming home from a night class at Del. Tech.  I usually take a back road over to route 9 to get home faster.  So i left college and made my way home on my normal backroad detour.  I got throught the first half of the twisted road and came up on the stop sign to turn right on to Asbury road.  As i did i turned on my high beams.  I came around a turn that leads to about a quater-mile, or a little more, stretch of road.  About 3/4 of the way down the road i could make out a standing figure next to a utility pole.  So immeadiatly i turned off my high beams, thinking it was a person because it was standing up.  As i got closer to this being i was taken back by its size.  I started to slow down not knowing it, i guess because i was puzzled and curious.  As i stared I could make out its bottom side, broad shoulders, the fact that it was standing with its back to me looking into the woods, and hair that came to a point at the top of its head.  This entire figure had a thick black cover of hair, with no hair on its hands.   I could not see its feet.  Standing next to the utility pole gave me some reference for height.  I estimate it was aorund 7 to 8 ft tall.  I was almost past this creature when it looked at me and then looked back to the woods as if it did''nt care i was there.  Once i made eye contact the hair on my arms stood up and i peeled out of the location.  I was confused as to what just happened and could''nt believe what i witnessed.  It also is hard to comprehend that i have seen a bigfoot and I have seen something that does''nt exist. ",

    " I had been working a swing shift at a paper press \"American Press\" from 3pm to 12 midnite, in the town of Mineral, VA (I think it was Mineral, in Louisa County.) <BR>About five of us were travelling home to Louisa, VA on not-too-isolated country road, when suddenly I saw something cross and go into the skinny forest at the side of the road. The first thing that struck me about it, was the way it moved. On a very primal level, I registered that it moved like nothing I had ever seen before; and my instinct on that primal level, was a gut-wrenching fear-reaction. Everything was happening very quickly, and the only light was from our headlights, but I noticed it was tall, and skinny, a dark figure with bad posture (a little hunched over.) Taller than any man I had ever seen, and I couldn''t figure out why a man would be at that particular spot, as there was not much around, and it was midnight.<BR>I turned around to one of the people in the van and saw she was staring at the same spot and I said \"Did you see that?\" She said \"Yes.\" She didn''t want to talk about it much, but I asked her what her first reaction was, and she said \"fear.\" When I asked her why, she said \"because of the way it moved, it looked like a killer.\" So then we talked about how something \"different\" would cause our first reaction to be fear, but the reaction soon after was of joy and wonder that we (older women, been there/done that) had truly seen something we had never seen before. It made us both smile, and I looked Bigfoot up on the internet the next day, as I had heard about sightings all across the US, but had never heard of them being around populated areas in the Virginia area.",

    " I was ridding my atv on the family farm going down an old washed out road which you cant drive fast on. As I started down the road looking down at the road then looking up down the road something caught my eye about 150 to 200 yards down this road. The sun was to my left shining across this road to the right as I looked down this narrow road there was a reflection of the light coming off the fur of something that I never had seen before,it was tall and massive. For that split second I saw it. The way the suns reflection came off of this thing it look almost silver. But being a hunter (I hunt this land all the time) There isnt anything silver in color. And that the sun coming off the back of a black turkey can look silver. So thats what caught my eye. This animal went back in to the woods back to the right. I worked my way down to where I thought I saw it. I turned my atv off and smoked a cig. Listing for any thing and about 5 min. had past and I heard something big running away from my direction breaking big tree limbs. (It was way louder than a deer running through the thickets). I could hear this for about 1 to 2 seconds and then it went quiet again. If I had to guess how far away it was I would say about 50 to 60 yards away from me when I first heard the running. (You cant see more than 20 yards in to this thickets from where I was at. (Hunting season end for general firearms 10 days before this so the deer are still alert.) Then it seemed like a couple of min. later I heard two big bangs like someone hitting a stick against a tree or log then the hair on the back of my neck stood up.Then there was the snorting of the deer that came from the thicket right after that. (When a deer snorts from my experience in the woods during the day they see you and snort once or twice and then they take off leaving you just to see there white tail waving at you as they go out of sight.) But there must have been 4 or 5 white tail in there all of them snorting and stomping the ground and they were real loud.The deer did this for about what seamed to be more than a min.then I heard them take off running. And thats when I decided it was time for me to leave too.I went home and told my wife about what had just happened and she couldnt believe it and was surprised at what I told her and ask if it was bear? I told her I never saw a beer in the woods and it seamed way to big to be a black bear.So the next day (Wednesday the 22nd) I wasnt going to GO BACK THAT DAY.I took a camera in where I heard this animal and took pictures of what I believe to be footprints and some hair that was left on a tree limb about 5 1/2 feet off the ground",

    " My ex-wife and I were driving on highway 94 in Carroll county, VA about 3-4 miles from the Wythe county line. We were returning from a Christmas shopping night in West Virginia. It was around midnight. I was driving and she was in the passenger seat talking away as usual, when all of a sudden we came upon something standing upright in a field off to the left. <BR><BR>I slowed to a stop and asked my ex what the hell is that? She couldn''t say a word. We observed the thing for about 10 minutes from the side of the road. I am a deer hunter and used a spotlight to help illuminate the moonless night. The thing was at least 8 foot tall and had to top 500lbs. <BR><BR>We never talked about this to anyone for fear of being called crazy. This is the first time i have ever breathed a word about it. I heard of other sightings in this area but had never encountered it until that night.",

    " While driving from Richmond, VA to Charleston, WV, on I-64, I saw what I assumed was a deer run into heavy east-bound traffic. One vehicle had to brake hard to avoid hitting this thing. When it came out between the cars and hit the grassy 70ft. median, it was running like a sprinter runs. I thought \"That''s not a deer, it''s a man\". He never slowed down when he got to the west-bound lanes and ran right behind a car passing an empty log truck. He almost ran into the rear of the truck, so he stopped. At this time I saw that he was covered from the top of his head to the ground with long dark brown hair. As soon as the truck passed, he sprinted across the lane and into the woods. The middle of his shoulder was even with the bottom of the cradle on the log trailer. When I passed this point, my 30yr. old son saw him running up the hill through the woods.",

    " Just two nights ago,( 2/16/09) my brother who lives up the hollow from my house called a little after 8 p.m. to say he had seen something outside in his yard. It seemed to be turned in the direction of his chicken house, at an angle to him, where it could keep a lookout both toward his house and the driveway which passes on up further into the hollow where there is another house. I have another brother that lives right across the driveway from the first brother. This brother says that two nights (2/14/09) before my brother saw what he did, he thought he saw something standing at the end of my 1st brother''s screened in porch, my second brother was smoking on his screened in porch, and when he opened his screen door to get a better look, my 1st brother''s pole light (which has a short in it) went out, and he couldn''t see anything at all in that direction then. A few years ago, a third brother and neighbor to these other brothers, was walking in the dark without a light to my 2nd brother''s house, and something screamed like a woman at him, and terrified him. This is a man standing 6'' tall and over 300 lbs. My 1st brother is also 6'' tall and over 300 lbs, and the creature he saw was taller and weighed more than he did. But he said it didn''t seem to be fat. It had reddish brown fur-hair. He did not see the facial features due to the profile stance the creature was in and he said that it seemed to be aware that it, my brother yelled out loud, \"What the heck is that!\" and ran toward his front door that opens to his screened porch, he said that he felt the creature heard him and knew it had been observed and when he went to the front door and stepped out on the screened in porch, it was gone. The dogs didn''t show up until my brother yelled for them. I myself have had a couple of things happen to me, that at the time they happened were unexplained but now I wonder if they are not related. Last fall my daughter and myself were leaving her house, she lives at the bottom of my hill near the creek, when something that screamed like a women terrified us. Then I heard what sounded like someone hit the side of my house under the breezeway where my bedroom is located, and I have had what sounded to me like a man walking across my house again over where my bedroom is located and in a minute or two it retraced its steps. I was very frightened to say the least! ",

    " To keep it short..I was deer hunting in the new river gorge in Fayetteville WW and it was in 2007, the week of thanksgiving.<BR>It was evening with about two hours of daylight left and I noticed movement about 60 yards towards the gorge from my position..I raised my gun to view the movement through the scope..after holding it in position for 10 sec or so I saw a very large hand appear from the side of a large Poplar tree..it was palm against the tree and I saw fingers mostly..then to my surprise I saw a head peek from around the large tree and two LARGE eyes affixed on a head if a creature I''ve never seen before..and I''m a hunter..have been since I was 8..I''m now 38.. The Bigfoot blinked twice while looking at me and then stepped back behind the tree..I viewed it for about 20 seconds while it was looking at me..my mind just couldn''t figure out what it was and I knew what it wasn''t..I had no desire to shoot it and very well could have but my mind and body almost seemed to be in a state of shock while viewing it..I had to cross near the location on the trail out if the woods and I was F''n terrified even with a loaded deer rifle..my hair stood on end when I realized that I would have to go towards the location to get out of the woods..I called my uncle as soon as I got to my jeep and told him..he believed me..I am a VERY honest man and would never lie about this..the thing is though..I never heard it run away or move through the leaves..and you can hear movement from 200+ yards off in these woods..it''s like it just disappeared..I came home very shaken from the experience and it changed my life..now I know that it is out there. It was very cool looking..about 7ft tall, it had very dark large pupils and around the pupils its eyes were almost owl like..it had brownish blond fur and it had a visible face..it almost looked like the troll faces that you used to put on your pencils as kids..really..but, it was very clean looking and not what you would expect..its fingers were long and thick with no fur and it had dark fingernails..I had my scope on 9 power and it was equivalent to being about 30 ft from me visually..it was real and I would take a polygraph and swear on my life.",

My sister was lying back in the passenger seat when I noticed in my car headlights on the left side of the road the head of an animal in the creek bed. I said out loud what then heck is that? My sister became aware that I was looking at something and starting looking too. As I slowed down to see what it was, it came out of the creek bed on two legs and it ran right towards our car. It then ran along the side of our car (five feet away) for a few seconds. We noticed its brown shaggy hair all over its body and its immense size.  Being very scared, we sped off as quickly as possible fearing the animal was going to jump on our car. When we told people what we had seen, they said all we saw was a horse or a large dog. We both know that whatever this thing was, it ran on two legs, had brown shaggy hair, and was extremely large in size.  We estimate that this thing was close to eight feet tall and over 500 pounds in size. It was hard to get a good look at the face because of darkness and it being so close to the car.

    " I was hunting West Virginia''s late antler-less deer season in the Canaan Valley National Wildlife Refuge when the sighting occurred. I had gotten to the area shortly after 3:00pm that evening, and after parking my vehicle in the \"Camp 70\" parking area I hiked up what appeared to be an old logging trail directly behind the parking area. I had already gotten a late start and wanted to get afield as quickly as possible, so I decided to stalk along the logging trail until I got further into the river bottom. After hunting the trail for roughly 30 minutes I was able to see a long distance in the river bottom to my right, so I decided to move into the bottom in hopes a deer would emerge from the thick along the river at dusk. I came across another \"road\" after leaving the logging trail, so I started walking further into the valley on it. The road was frozen and crusted over due to the cold temperatures, which made traveling quietly impossible, so after a short distance I found a small group of trees a few yards from the trail and set up in them. Shortly after arriving I heard what sounded like brush breaking 150 - 200 yards below me, towards the river. I readied myself in hopes it was a group of deer moving into the flats to feed, but nothing appeared. A few minutes passed by and I heard the sound again, and again, nothing materialized. I decided to move closer, and positioned myself in another group of small trees 100 yards or so below my first site. I had been in this grove of saplings for 5 - 10 minutes when I caught movement in a cluster of trees that was about 80 - 90 yards below me and to the left. I could see the movement with my naked eye, and immediately upon seeing it I scoped the group of trees and to my surprise saw nothing. A few minutes went by and I caught the movement again, I quickly scoped the trees, and this time I was shocked by what I saw. At first I thought it was a large man, as the first thing I saw through my scope was a vague silhouette, but when my eyes focused I could see what appeared to be a primate-like creature standing upright and staring directly at me. It only broke it''s stillness to slightly move the upper portion of it''s body in an up and down motion. It would bend it''s knees as if it was going to sit down, then immediately straighten back up. This went on for what seemed to have been over a minute, then the creature exited the group of tree''s and moved to my left (the creature''s right), towards the mountain behind me. It walked across an expanse of river basin that I would guess to be 70 - 80 yards long before entering the timber and exiting my field of view. It kept watching me the whole time it was walking, only breaking it''s stare on me a few times to look directly ahead of it. I initially thought of attempting to locate it''s track''s, but my nerves got the best of me and I started moving towards the parking lot as quickly as I could. Though the creature never actually made any threatening movements, I didn''t feel safe enough to continue hunting and remain in the valley any longer after the sun went down than I had to.

    " It was January 2005 and I was living in Job, WV with my daughter who was five years old at the time. I was renting the house which was a little ways from the road. It was about 3:30pm and I was walking down the long drive way to meet my daughter to get off the school bus. It had been snowing the night before and it was cold out with a few flurries. Well as I got to the end of the drive way the bus came and stopped and I went across the street to get my little girl off the bus and I turned around and at first was talking to my daughter I didn''t look straight ahead in front of me but when I looked up I noticed a very large brown figure standing below my porch which was second story and as I walked up holding my daughter''s hand it just stood there staring at first I couldn''t figure out what it was I have been in WV all my life and had seen many bear, bobcats and even a cougar. So I knew this was not any of these and it was standing at least eight foot tall with man like features it had kind of a flat nose its eyes were shaped like an owls and it blinked several times it didn''t move the whole time we were walking to the other side of my porch to go up the steps. In fact we even looked down on it from the upstairs porch. My daughter threw some pebbles down and it still didn''t move we didn''t stay outside to see when it walked off but I will never forget what I saw I haven''t seen anything else like it since.",

When we got <BR>to the area where it crossed I stopped and rolled the window down and was  <BR>shining my mag light in the woods. Back about maybe twenty yards in the woods  <BR>I noticed this tree that had a big lump on the side of it. Well, I focused my light  <BR>on that tree for a few seconds just looking when all of sudden this thing stepped  <BR>out, looked right at us then turned and walked on into the woods out of sight.    <BR>At that point I didn''t know what to do. My wife was yelling for me to get out of <BR>there so I hit the gas and drove off. Being dark as it was, it''s hard to say just  <BR>how big it was but I would guess around 7 feet tall. It looked to be covered in  <BR>brownish hair all over. I''m not sure about the face, I couldn''t see it that good.  <BR>The only reason I knew it was looking at us was because it''s eyes were  <BR>glowing red from the flashlight.

I proceeded to the next tube, and after placing the paper in it, my headlights caught something off to the far left. I observed a figure walking along the treeline along the edge of the cornfield away from my position. At first I thought it might be a man, but it was all black and it turned and I saw large red eyes staring back. I could not make out it''s face, and it continued to walk away. I turned my vehicle in past the paper tube to try and get a better look. It was at this point it stopped and looked at my direction again. From my estimation it looked to be at least 75 to 100 yards away, and about 6 or 7 feet tall. The creature then continued walking away, and feeling spooked I drove out of there fast. I proceeded to finish my paper route, trying to comprehend what I had just seen. It was just starting to become ligher out, it was about 6:45am, and it was still quite dark out. This area has a lot of farmland and wooded areas, and is very rural. The whole incident occured in about 20 or 25 seconds. I felt as if I might have disturbed \"it\", for I felt an uneasy feeling when it looked my way.

    " I was on my home from work in Bishopville, traveling on Hwy. 15 at approximately 2:10am.<BR><BR>I had a near miss with a large deer near Lydia that had me shaken and alert for other possible deer on the road. I made the left turn on hwy 15 to 15 north and I drove about 3 miles when I noticed a large shape on the other lane ahead of my car about 100 yards, I assumed that it was another deer so I slowed my car down to about 30 to 40 mph to allow time for the animal to cross over. as I approached nearer to this shape I noticed that it was human like because it was standing erect on 2 legs and it had arms like a man however, when I got within 40 ft of this creature I realized that it wasn''t a bear or a deer and that it appeared to be very tall. I floored it... I was very afraid, I didn''t know what to expect, but I knew that I was safer than a sitting duck. As I passed this creature, It seemed like it lunged towards my car and nearly took off my side mirror. I looked out of my drivers side window and noticed that its shoulders were above the top of my van and I also noticed that it was covered in hair that was light in color. I did not see the face of this creature, only its body and the outline of it as I approached.",

    " On our way home to Rockmart, GA from Birmingham, AL, we were following the directions the GPS gave for the distance.  This brought us to Hwy 120 and Vincent Mountain Road.  We had just made that turn and gone a mile and a half when my husband and myself saw a large figure standing in the tree line.  There was illumination coming from the right side of the road from an additional light source other than our car headlights.  This enabled us to clearly see this figure that was on the left side of the road with one arm straight down and the other arm slightly moving.  I believe that arm movement is what caught our attention making us both look to our left CLEARLY allowing us both to view this creature.  It was covered in reddish brown fur from head to toe with a face I can only describe as Ape like. It appeared to be over seven feet tall. He/she seemed to be getting ready to cross the road. After about 15 seconds past, he and I both screamed out, \"did you just see what I saw???\"  <BR><BR>I have never been a big believer in the legend of Bigfoot, but I know what I saw tonight.

    " A friend and I decided to go boating one Saturday morning and went to Scotts landing in Nassau County, Florida on the St Marys River. We rented a boat and headed west up the St Marys River into Georgia.  We traveled west about 15 miles where we went around a bend and our motor must have hit something in the water and shut off.  We drifted to the bank on the Georgia side of the river where we tried to start the boat with no success. This was about 3:30 pm with about 3 hours of light left as it is getting dark about 6pm. There was a fishing camp on the Florida side of the river with no one there so we paddled over to that side where we settled in and built a campfire to spend the night as our phones had no service. We settled by the fire and talked and had a good time. Around 12:30AM we began to hear something moving thru the woods from far off. We could tell it was moving towards us because the breaking branches and snapping twigs and crunching leaves were getting louder. When it got down to the rivers edge across from us we heard grunting and growling as well as stomping on the ground that was extremely loud and a deep base thud. I got up and walked down to the rivers edge and started shining the opposite bank. As I was shining I could hear something moving thru the brush towards me. As it got directly across from me I saw it thru the brush and could see a shoulder and head moving left straight across from me. I could see it moving for about 5 to 6 feet before it came to a tree where it stepped out from behind the tree and looked directly at me. I shined the light in its face and saw two red eyes and a head and right shoulder. When the light hit it in the face it turned its head back to the direction it came from and took off back that way. It seemed mad cuz it started stomping and growling and breaking limbs again. It continued to raise hell for another hour to hour and a half before it went quiet. Of course we did not sleep that night and at the first light we got in the boat and started rowing towards home and made it about 5 miles where we were picked up by the Nassau County police boat and towed another 10 1/2 miles back to Scotts Landing.  It was a truly amazing experience for me, my buddy however didn''t agree with me. He said he was frozen with fear and will never return there. I myself would love to return and search for the creature.",

    " Last December in Brooks County Georgia in the early hours of the morning I was driving home to Florida on Clyattville Road. I was approaching the longest bridge between ROCKY FORD ROAD & Rt 53, I saw something that looked like very tall man standing near the side of the bridge. I had my bright lights on, so I flashed my lights to warn this pedestrian at this hour that I was approaching. I then tapped the horn, but this very large figure didn''t run. It appeared as I drew closer to be reaching for something beyond the bridge, (perhaps leaves of the trees) I began to slow down as I approached the bridge, fearing this very big man was drunk, and would stagger in<BR>front of my car. But as I approached the object I saw this was either a GIANT of a man in a shaggy<BR>fur coat, or a HUGH animal I had never seen! It was standing on two feet, and its arms were long, this I noticed as it turned its head toward the car, it dropped one arm to its side. I cannot describe its face, because I was \"SCARED\" nearly to , because as it turned its head my lights reflecked in its eye, and it glowed RED, instead of green, or yellow, as I am used to seeing from<BR>animals I had viewed at night on the road. I was scared so bad I raced home, but didn''t mention this until weeks later to even my husband, because I was trying to rationalize this in my mind as fatigue, night illusions whatever I could label it. Besides I was afraid of being told I was crazy. I am a professional that needs to remain sane in the public''s eye! I would very much like to get some feed back on this, but I positively do NOT want my name, or profile mentioned on the internet! I am willing to work with anyone that is serious about finding what this is,but I must maintain a low public profile, because not only am I a professional, but I am a woman! But I am NOT a crazy woman, I know positively what I saw! ",

    " I was out hunting small game in Camp Blanding,on the still hunt side,close to Cemetary Road,I had a friend of mine about 150 yards to my right and about 30-40 yards in front.I saw something running between us,going from my right to in front of me,it was between the two of us.It stopped about 50-60 yards in front of me and turned and looked at me,I stood looking trying to figure out what I was seeing for maybe 30 seconds,I then got down on one knee,and watched about 45 seconds,it turned to its right,my left,and was gone.It was a dark brown,allmost black,running kinda like an old man that had back problems,bent over a little at the waist.It was on two legs,not four as all other animals in the woods have.I could see the arms moving as it ran,just as a man''s would when he is running.I am 6 foot tall,I walked to the spot I saw it,loooking  at the tree it was beside,and was looking to see if I could tell how tall it was.From what I could tell from what I saw,it stood about 7 foot tall.I looked for any tracks,found none as it was a swamp,nothing but water,but you could see evidence that something was there from the way the grass in the water was laid over.I called to my friend,asked if he saw anything,he said no.We both started walking,hunting more,all the while I was thinking about what I saw.We walked approx. 1/2 mile from where I saw whatever it was,and he saw a VERY large pile of feces on the ground,we both looked at it for a while,poking at it with sticks,trying to figure out what kind of animal it could have come from.We both have hunted for over 35 years each,and have never seen anything like this.We saw alot of grassy materials,and alot of berries in it.No hair,bones,or anything that you  would see from most carnivores in the woods.",

    " I was out behind my house smoking, walking my dogs around 6:30 pm, just before dark. My back yard is grass for about 100 yards then it is medium to heavy woods (about 4 acres total).<BR><BR>My dogs just froze in place looking towards the woods. I was asking them whats wrong, what do you see? They stayed still, gazing into the woods for about a minute. I also looked towards the woods but saw nothing but trees and I could make out a large tree stump, then they both ran from me back into the house through a the doggy door on the North side of my house. When looking towards the woods they are to the East of me. I kept staring at the woods looking side to side while still seeing nothing. My cigarette was done, I tossed it onto the ground and went to step on it when I noticed some movement about 20 yards in the woods. It was towards the tree stump...I watched as this stump, which was about 3 to 4 foot tall stand up and double its size... I was in shock, it seemed like it was not real. <BR><BR>I stayed motionless while watching this thing, which clearly was NO tree stump start to walk deeper into the woods, heavy steps each time it walked, it was between 7'' or 8 feet tall, had hair/fur covering it. The way I could tell this is because it was walking in a zig zag motion, purposely I guess to try and hide from me behind trees. The sun would only shine in spots through the top of the trees and I could see the hair/fur shine maybe every 5 seconds or so/ This thing made noise/sound only twice from itself, once when it first rose up, I interpreted it as a \"Damn now I have to move\" moan/grunt... second when he/she looked at me right before it got to the gas line road (which is a dirt, right of way road for the gas company) almost to tell me, you stay where you are, don''t follow me and I had no plans on that.... <BR><BR>I went back out the next day, dogs refused to go with me, to see if there was something it was doing in the woods and found nothing. Also went to the dirt road looking for prints but found only a part of one because of deer and other animals walking over them. <BR><BR>I believe this thing, and others follow the deer here for food, the [Suwannee River] State Park has a no Hunting buffer I think that is 5 or 10 miles out from the park. The deer know this and I am sure if these things have been here for a while also know that people don''t hunt around here.. I have been away from this house do to selling it but recently purchased it back. Only one of my dogs is still with me and will still not walk in the woods like we used to... <BR><BR>This thing had medium to dark reddish/brown hair/fur, when it snarled/growled at me. I saw fingers, no hair on the palms because I could see skin, no facial hair. It did not stink as bad as I read about. It smelled more like wet dog and pine sap..I have been back here about 3 weeks but see no signs of this thing but did hear its growl two nights ago, I was on my front porch that faces west, smoking before going to bed. My dog was laying by my side. What ever it was scared my dog and me also. It sounded like an owl at first but turned into a growl at the end.  Weird... I will wait to hear from you if you would like to know more.<BR>",

    " This sighting report was originally submitted by the witness'' mother.<BR><BR>I contacted the witness and spoke with her about her sighting. She told me that on New Year''s Eve, she and her family were at her uncle''s house shooting fireworks. She and her cousin were playing with cap guns and had wandered towards a wooded area on the back of her uncle''s property.<BR><BR>The witness stated that when she looked back into the trees, she could see something very large, standing half behind a tree looking at her and her cousin. She described it as being \"furry\" with red eyes. Her cousin also saw the creature.<BR><BR>They both turned to run back to their parents and the witness said when she turned back the creature was walking away on two legs. She further stated that it was walking funny and appeared to have a limp. When I asked her what she meant by walking \"funny\" she told me that it walked somewhat like an ape would walk.<BR><BR>She and her cousin both ran back to their parents and began telling them about what they''d seen but she said her uncle started making fun of them seeing a \"bogeyman\". A few minutes later she and her cousin, using a flashlight, went back to see if they could spot the creature again. She said that upon their return, it had apparently left because they didn''t see it.<BR><BR>",

It was a small and shallow brook layered with 5-10 lbs rocks, so we washed off, cooled down and as we were leaving the brook it was out of sight but not sound, we heard some noises of rocks moving and colliding or being tossed into other rocks. We were nervous of a wild animal. As we approached we heard like a hog running off, only we caught a glimpse of an ape like mammal charging through and away from the brook. The rocks on the bank and in the water were moved and jumbled in a very distinct way.  Because of the leaves, there was no other prints except one upper left side of a left foot imprinted in the mud touching the water.

    " The witness'' daughter originally submitted this report after he <BR>had relayed it to her. Subsequently, Vince Lauria and myself met with the witness on March 19, 2003 and conducted a personal interview and had the witness take us to the actual sighting location.<BR><BR>The following is the account of the sighting as told to us by the witness.<BR><BR>On February 18, 2003 at approx. 5:30 AM, the witness was heading eastbound on Interstate 10 when he saw what he first believed to be a person stepping out onto the highway just as a tractor-trailer rig had passed it. Because the tractor-trailer rig''s rear lights illuminated the animal he was able to see it.  The witness tapped his brakes to disengage the cruise control and turned on his high beams. He stated to us that his first thought was perhaps someone had broken down on the Interstate or been involved in an accident but when he got a better look at it, he realized it wasn''t human. He stated that, \"its hands hung almost to its knees and it moved in a hunched posture.\" When questioned further, the witness stated that it moved with its knees bent in \"almost a glide\" and that its arms stayed by its side as opposed to swinging back and forth.<BR><BR>He further described the creature as being approximately 7'' in height; 250 to 275 pounds with a muscular, \"squatty\" build and was covered with reddish hair. The head appeared to sit directly on the shoulders and was somewhat pointed. A note of interest; the witness told us the hair on it''s head looked \"slicked back\" as if it had just been combed, not as if it were wet. He also stated that the creature never looked toward his truck so he didn''t notice any facial detail.<BR><BR>According to the witness, the creature wasn''t running but was moving \"at a good trot\". It crossed both traffic lanes and the breakdown lane in 4 or 5 steps. At the time of the sighting, the creature was approximately sixty to seventy yards from the witness, and the sighting lasted about thirty seconds, maximum.<BR><BR>",

I have submitted a detailed report [see report #63433] and have discussed with one of your researchers. This creature matches somewhat the published reports of the same area, that being near the Crestview exit. What I saw was impossible to fake with a costume. The creature was approx. 8 feet tall and had obviously articulated muscles as it moved from the edge of the road, down a gully and into the tree line. The movement, particularly down a deep slope and up the other side would make it almost impossible for a human in a suit to accomplish. There was an additional car with witnesses. I do not wish to have my identity published as I am a current state government official with past time in a law enforcement agency.

    " After watching several episodes of your show on Animal Planet, I decided to tell my story; I am actually getting goose bumps thinking of it. This happened in Orlando, Florida around the early 2000s,  we lived in a suburban area but around it has a heavy forest area and this was before any of the major shopping centers and housing were built. My cousin had come up for the weekend from Miami to hang out, we were probably in our second year of high school. I remember it was around 2am to 4am and we were driving home and before our entrance to our neighborhood there is a small lake with a patch of forest in the middle of it, and across from it there is the neighborhood playground and a daycare which was pretty dark at that time so my cousin decides to pull in by the playground to smoke a cigarette. So the lake was across from us and the cars front was facing the playground, I stayed in the car and my cousin was leaning on his side of the car. After a bit my cousin starts frantically trying to open his door which I dont know if it got locked and he left the keys in the ignition or the door doesnt open from his side, so I look in the rear view mirror and there standing is this huge dark figure ( here comes the goose bumps again) standing there, in the dim light you can see the fur texture and the muscles, so I turn around and look through the window and I see it just standing there like if it was shocked to see us there and I remember as soon as I opened the door and my cousin  started the car it took off to the right and we hauled butt to the left towards our neighborhood.  When we got to the entrance of our neighborhood we decided to go back towards where it was heading and of course we couldnt find no trace. I can still picture the figure plainly and right now I feel the tingling of goose bumps as I am thinking of it. We didnt tell anybody about the incident and being that young we wouldnt think people will believe us anyway, its just crazy our something like that can stay planted in your mind after so long so clearly, but I just wanted to let you guys know my story, keep up the awesome work with the show and the research.",

    " I want to start out by saying that I have never discussed this with anyone except for one other person. I have not discussed it with my wife, my best friend, or any other person close to me in my life. I was fortunate to have a coworker who had, many years ago, shared a similar personal experience that he had in Utah. He is the only person with whom I have shared my experience. I also want to say that what I am about to describe to you has tormented me for the last several months. I cannot emphasize enough how this encounter has affected me emotionally. Thanks to the encouragement of a fantastic confidant, I am now coming forward to report the incident as a step toward putting it behind me and getting on with my life. I did not ask for this, and had the event been within my control, I would have absolutely chosen not to have the experience. My life was perfectly fine with my previous view of reality, as incomplete and skewed as it may have been. <BR><BR>I grew up in a very rural setting, and have always loved the outdoors and being in nature. I love to spend time in the beautiful wetlands and forests of Floridas vast uninhabited wilderness areas. Monday through Friday, I work as an executive in a very large multinational corporation based in Orlando, FL, and being shut up in an office building throughout the week makes me stir-crazy. My life is a very high-stress environment, with responsibilities that include a multi-million dollar P&L, and oversight of approximately 1,000 employees. My weekends are often spent decompressing in nature through hiking or canoeing, especially in the winter months when the temperature is more comfortable. <BR><BR>On the morning of Sunday, January 15th, I was visiting friends in Lake Mack, FL, which is a very small community located in a rural area of Central Florida about 10 miles west of Deland, FL, and about 30 miles from my home. To get to this area, go west on HW 44 out of Deland. Highway 44 will curve south just before the drawbridge that crosses the St. Johns River. The Pier 44 Marina will be on the left and is visible from the drawbridge. Immediately after crossing the drawbridge from Volusia into Lake County, turn right onto County Road 42 and continue west for about four miles. If approaching on the westbound side of the road, the Lake Mack community will be located on the south (left) side of CR 42, and the Ocala National Forest on the north (right). CR 42 traverses the southern edge of the 600 square mile Ocala National Forest.<BR><BR>Having never been to Lake Mack prior to the 15th, I had earlier looked at the Google Maps application installed on my Blackberry to get directions. I noticed that the Ocala National Forest was just across the road, and saw that there were several forest service roads that crisscrossed the southern portion of the forest. I decided that after my visit, I would go drive through the forest and possibly do some exploring and hiking. <BR><BR>I finished up in Lake Mack about noon and drove west on CR 42 for about 1 mile, and turned right onto Deerhaven Road and proceeded north into the forest. Deerhaven Road is paved for about the first 2 or 3 miles until it turns into National Forest Service Road 420, which to my surprise was a one-lane, very bumpy, unpaved road. Initially, I was very nervous about continuing, but the dirt-road was compacted and my car appeared to handle it with no problems. Feeling a bit more comfortable, I continued deeper into the woods. <BR><BR>I drove for what I would estimate to be another 3 miles or so. The road passed through an area that appeared to have been burned in the past by a forest fire, as most of the pines were dead and only a very thick 3 to 5 ft layer of saw palmetto and other scrubby bushes covered the ground. In this area, the visibility was better due to the lack of a forest canopy and I could see the forest line about a mile in the distance. At this point, the road was still good, and so I continued driving until I the road left the burned zone and entered the tree line into a heavily forested area. <BR><BR>I would estimate that after about  to 1 mile into the forested area, I started to notice an increasing amount of soft sand in the road rather than the hardened more compacted dirt that I had been driving on previously. I got nervous and decided to turn around and go back out of the forest on NFS 420 the same way that I had entered. At that moment I felt the car sink into sand. I quickly steered left up on the side of the road so that I could get turned around. I was able to get the car turned around in the opposite direction, but when I moved forward about a foot, the car sank deep in the sand. I tried for some period of time to get unstuck, but ended up only digging the tires deeper into the sand. It dawned on me what a stupid idea it was to bring a car into the backcountrylesson learned. So here I was, in one of the wildest and most remote areas in the State of Florida completely stranded and all alone.<BR><BR>I decided to try to dig out the wheels. I was down on my knees next to the front drivers side tire digging the sand with my hands. After a few minutes of this, I stood upright to stretch my back out of the hunched position I had been in. When I stood up, a rock pelted me and a shooting pain went through the inside of my left thigh near the groin area, which caused me to jump back and yelp in pain. Because I was leaning forward against the fender of the car, the rock bounced off my leg and onto the hood of the car, and then slid slowly down the hood and into the sand, which, to my relief, told me that it was not a bullet or snakebite. I immediately looked toward the forest on the other side of the road from where the rock came, and perceived movement in the bushes. At this point, I did not see the creature, but did see movement in the branches and leaves of the shrubs, grasses and saw palmetto. The movement was enough to convince me that someone or something was there, and that itwhatever it waswas the source of the rock.<BR><BR>Unsure of what to do, I stood there for about 30 seconds and checked my surroundings, including the road to the east and west, and the forest that was immediately behind me. After I turned back from looking into the trees behind me, I heard movement in the forest behind me. The sound that I heard was the sound of leaves and sticks being crushed on the ground, as if someone took one step and then stopped. The sound appeared to come from about 15 feet in the woods behind me. So now at this point, I had perceived movement in the woods on both sides of the road immediately in front of and behind me. I looked back again into the trees behind me where the noise originated, but saw nothing.<BR><BR>At this point, the fear struck me pretty hard. Several things crossed my mind, such as wild hogs, bears and coyotes. But none of those animals obviously, to my knowledge, were capable of throwing rocks. Then the thought crossed my mind that perhaps there were a couple of people who had decided to have a little fun at my expense.  So, I called out into the forest, Whos there? This isnt funny. I need help getting my car out of the sand. Please help me, and so on. I heard nothing in reply and saw no movement. <BR><BR>With the fear mounting and my thoughts turning more toward protection rather than getting my car unstuck, I remembered that I had a can of UDAP in my backpack in the trunk. The previous summer, I had hiked part of the Appalachian Trail in Tennessee and North Carolina and had purchased a couple of cans of UDAP for that trip. I walked around the back of the car, opened the trunk and pulled out my backpack. When I slammed the trunk shut, I again heard movement in the trees on the south side of the road and the location from which the rock had been thrown. I looked to my right and began unzipping the backpack when the creature started to make a hissing sound, though up to this point I still had not visually identified the animal. It was a very loud hissing sound, similar to what you might hear from a feral cat that is being cornered, only much, much louder and deeper. It then started to alternate between a hiss and a vocalization that sounded like haaaaawwwww. So the sound it was making was a protracted hhhiiiiiissssssssssssssss, haaaaawwwwwww, hhhiiiiissssssssssssssss, haaaaawwwwwwww, with an intermittent deeper gurgling sound interspersed throughout. <BR><BR>Hearing this put me into flight mode, and I immediately got in the car and locked the doors. When I slammed the door, I looked across the passenger seat out through the passenger side window and saw the creature about 15 feet into the woods as it got up and stood up on two legs. It was out of view previously, as I was able to later conclude, because it had been in a completely prostate position in or behind about 3 or 4 feet of saw palmetto. I saw its head rise up first, then its back, then it appeared to go to all fours, and finally pushed itself up with its long arms onto two legs. I briefly saw its side profile as it did not turn and face me directly, but rather stood up facing east in parallel to the road. Once it rose up completely on two legs, its head was obscured by the tree branches above, while at the same time, its feet and legs were obscured by the saw palmetto and other bushes below. So, at this point, I was looking at its torso through about a 3 to 4 foot clearing between the scrub below and the branches above.<BR><BR>To say the least, I was completely petrified. I was locked in my car, but absolutely did not feel safe at all. I would estimate that the creature was about 8 feet tall. It was extremely bulky across the bust, with very muscular arms, and I have no doubt that it could have easily busted out the windows and ripped me to shreds if it so desired. It stood there for what I would estimate to be about 3 seconds. I also observed what would commonly be described as a love-handle, around the side of the belly area and back. The creatures hair was black and gray in color and was slicked down against the lighter skin, which could be seen in some places through what appeared to be wet hair. The hair was very thick on the arms and shoulders but less so around the side belly and back areas. It appeared to be wet because the hair was slicked down against the skin.<BR><BR>After standing there for approximately three seconds, it hunched forward and walked east in parallel to the road and was immediately out of sight in the trees. Just before the first step, when the creature hunched forward, it put its hands forward to grab onto some branches, which allowed me to get a glimpse of its right hand. From what I could see, the top of the hand and arm was very hairy. It had about 3 inches of hair hanging down from the wrist area that was longer than the rest of the hair on its arm. One thing that stood out to me: when the arm swung up, I noticed the palm area was much lighter than the rest of the arm, almost a light grey or even off-white color, which was in stark contrast to the much darker hair that covered the other areas of the arm, torso and back. As it swam through the bushes, I could see the trees move and shake as it moved forward through the woods along the side of the road. It walked through the scrub for what I would estimate to be about 15 or 20 feet, and then stopped, again completely obscured from my view. Also, the hissing and other vocalization had stopped at this point and everything was completely quiet.<BR><BR>After about a minute had passed of no further movement, I saw a tiny dark portion of the creature peek out from behind a pine tree that was growing near the side of the road about 15 or 20 feet in front of me. I could not perceive any detail at this point whatsoever, just that it was hiding and peaking from behind the tree. It appeared to be crouching down because the peek appeared about 3 or maybe 4 feet up the side of the pine tree from the base of the tree on the ground.<BR><BR>It was obvious to me that the creature had previously responded to the slamming of the car door and trunk. Not knowing what else to do, I laid down on the horn and started opening and slamming shut the drivers side door hoping that such nuisance noises would drive it out of the area. It did in fact evoke a response, but not the one I was hoping for. After about 15 seconds of door-slamming and horn-honking, the creature lumbered slowly on all fours in sort of a crouched position from behind the tree onto the side of the road right along the tree line. I quickly slammed the door shut. As soon as the door slammed, the creature reared back and flung a soft-ball sized amount of slimy brown, lumpy material that was about the consistency and color of wet peanut butter all over the hood of the car. It slid down the hood and onto the sand in front of the car, leaving a wet residue on the hood.<BR><BR>It then put its arms forward, moving out of the crouched position, and then quickly crossed the road in front of me using both its arms and legs to walk on all fours, just like a four-legged animal. It looked back at me briefly and then disappeared into the tree line on the opposite side of the road. One thing I noticed at this point is that the creature was completely soaking wet from head to toe. When it flung the material at the car, I saw water drops shake off of the arm. It was very wet with the hair laying slicked to the skin, much like what you might see with a wet, long-haired dog.<BR><BR>The face of the creature was a dark grey color, with very large dark eyes. It had a very large mouth with extremely large, fat lips. The nose was human-like, with one exception, which was large, slightly flared nostrils. The nose did not protrude off its face in proportion to a humans, but was flatter and more sunken. The creature looked like an ape, but with facial featuresespecially the nasal areathat were very similar to those of humans.<BR><BR>I resumed honking the horn, but did not open the door because I did not have eye contact with it and further knew that it was now in the forest on the same side of the road where I was sitting in the drivers seat. I did not want to give it the advantage of an open door should it decide to jump out of the woods to my immediate left and attack the car.<BR><BR>About 1 minute after disappearing into the tree line, the creature reemerged, this time walking completely upright on two legs, just like a human. It paused at the tree line for a second, and then took one huge step back across the road. The creature, to my shock and horror, was carrying along a child of the same creature. It had both arms of the smaller creature grasped in its right hand, and was dangling the juvenile along by its side, with the legs of the smaller creature almost touching the ground. The smaller creature appeared to be completely limp from the neck down, but its eyes were open and it was moving its head and looking toward the trees to which it was being carried. After crossing the road, the creature paused at the tree line on the opposite side of the road, lifted the juvenile up onto its hip, and continued into the scrub. Just before disappearing, the small creature wrapped its legs around the back and stomach and clung to the creatures chest with its arms. Basically, it was carrying the smaller creature in the same way that a human would carry a child on the hip. It did not reemerge from that point forward, nor did I see any sign or hint of it again.<BR><BR>I would estimate that the smaller creature was about three feet tall. It was also a different color than the adult, with the child being more of a light brown, with possibly some hints of a red and blonde, versus the black and grey color of the adult. One thing that stood out about the child is that it appeared to be very, very thin, almost to the point of appearing emaciated. I could actually see the outline of the ribs through the skin and hair that covered it. <BR><BR>I sat petrified in my car for about an hour until I looked up and saw two hunters driving Jeeps down the road toward me. They were kind enough to pull my car out of the sand, and quickly got me going on my way out of the forest. Once I got on HWY 44, I left the area at about 85 mph and never looked back. I was in a state of complete shock over what I had experienced. Prior to this experience, I was not a Bigfoot believer. Og how wrong I was. <BR>",

    " I was driving south east on US Hwy 441 North between Ft. Drum and Okeechobee, Florida on Jan. 18, 2004. It was almost dusk, approx. 5:30 PM.

A spring type clip on which I need both hands to remove. I turned my head and dropped them in my purse on the seat next to me. As I looked up toward my rear view mirror a flash of movement caught my attention. <BR><BR>It happened so fast all I saw was the last few steps of a small hominid running across the road in front of me. It wasn''t close but I''m not sure how far away. It stopped on the edge of the road for a split second and made a leap over the roadside ditch and a barbed wire fence. I tired to reason I had seen a limpkin or a sandhill crane but knew it wasn''t. I braked as soon as I saw the first movement and slowed to 20 mph by the time I thought I was where it had leaped into the bushes. I couldn''t see any bushes moving or water movement. I was so intent on looking at the side of the road I didn''t think to look into the pasture on the other side of the barbed wire. If I had been sure in my mind I had seen a wading bird I wouldn''t have slowed as I see them all the time. I knew in my heart it was something different from what I''d ever seen before.<BR><BR>I have reported this to the Mysterious Encounters web site and have thought more on it and will now revise my estimates of it''s size. I judge it to be 3 1/2 to 4 feet tall and between 75 and a 100 pounds. It had a very round head on an upright body no neck to speak of. The hair was long and silky not matted or tangled. It was a brownish red, more light brown than red. I''m sure it had it''s head turned away from me and I was seeing the back of it''s head as I didn''t see any facial features. I remembered seeing it''s foot later. It was like a person of color whose skin is darker than the sides of their feet. The hair hung lightly over the sides of the edges of it''s foot. I saw one arm and it reached almost to the knee.  When it leaped it didn''t swing it''s arms out or bend it''s knees to jump it just leaped flat footed, pushing off. The distance it leaped was approx. 20 to 25 feet. <BR><BR>Seeing it bothered me and then I saw the Redwood Giant episode of Mysterious Encounters, Jan. 24, on OLN. A man on the show said a three foot tall hominid ran in front of his car in NC. It hit me like a shot, I knew what I had seen then. That''s when I filled out the report form on their web site. I did a Google search tonight and found your site.<BR><BR>The more I''ve thought about it and talked with my family ( after they stopped laughing) we have come up with other times we could have been in the presence of these hominds over the years. Once two years ago my son and I were on the Kissimmee River, the western boundry between Okeechobee County and Highlands County, Florida. We heard a call...scream.. yell, from a distance. After discussing it my son said it must have been a big bellied redneck out hunting or a skunk ape, we laughed it off but kept a watch around us the rest of the day. It was very disturbing. <BR><BR>A year a go a friend and I were on the board walk of the Grassy Waters Preserve on North Lake Blvd in northern Palm Beach County, Fl. It was early morning and we were walking to the end to go into the little nature museum and looked out across the water and sawgrass toward a cypress head. Standing in plain sight was a BIG dark figure. It would bend over and do something in the water at the base of a cypress tree, then stand up and act like it was eating something. This went on for quite a while, bend over- stand up. The woman who was in charge of the museum came out with a pair of binoculars but they were so badly fogged we couldn''t make out details. Just a big homind figure. There are many more times and incidents I could relate but they go back to the mid 1970''s. So I will stick with the present.",

    :otherstories
    "We lived in Montura Estates for 17 years and we had a couple odd things happen. One was when my daughter and I returned home from church and I`d misplaced my key. We were standing outside on the porch waiting for my husband and son to come home when we heard an awful scream coming out of the reserve. We lived right next to the Reserve. I owned peacocks so I know what they sound like. Some people say they sound like a person screaming. I always liked them and their call never bothered me. This was something I`d never heard and it scared us both. We ran to the car and locked the doors and waited. My husband said it was probably a panther. I never heard one so I don`t know.Also a friends brother-in-law came down and stayed in a mobile home that their family owned. It stood empty most of the time. He left very suddenly and I asked my friend what happened. She said he saw something come across the field in front of the mobile and look him in the eyes. He said something big and black. She said that he was seeing things. She said he drank heavy and he was seeing things that weren`t there. She said that all the black bear were hunted out and that there wasn`t any around the area anymore. Her and her family were big into hunting then. My daughter bought that mobile and land after she got married. She asked me one day what I thought he saw. I told her probably a big black dog or maybe a panther. She said go out and look in the window. I did and I had to stand on my toes to see over the sill. I then realized what my daughter thought it was. She thought it was what her dad and I`d seen several years earlier.",

    " My husband and I were returning home from the store. We were in no hurry so we took the long way around. We liked to see if any new homes were going in. Montura Estates at that time was very scarcely populated.  It is a very large area and then what people that lived there were widely scattered. Very heavy pine woods, palmettos and cypress swamps. <BR><BR>It had been raining earlier and still was drizzling off and on. I saw a person come up out of the woods further up the road and start walking in same direction we were traveling. I remember thinking who would be out  walking on a day like that. We were traveling very slow. This person then crossed road in front of us and still continued traveling same way. As we got to where we had to turn we slowed up even more. That''s when I realized that this person was still heading south on Hacienda. He had crossed over Hunting Club Ave that we were turning on. That is when I really looked at this person for there was nothing out that way at all then.  I then saw that there was hair blowing on its legs, long hair.  I then realized that it had hair all over its body. It was black or very dark. Its hair on its head was long and seemed angled to its shoulders. Its arms were held close to its sides. Very big, over 6 ft. tall. 300lbs or more. The trees were very tall and even the palmettos were very thick and tall so I`m not sure how tall.<BR><BR>By this time we had come to a complete stop and it was out of sight as we were in the middle of our turn and the trees blocked our view.  I turned to my husband. We hadn`t said a word till then. He said was that what I thought it was?  I said I think so. We backed up but It was gone. We looked down Hacienda all the way to the end and back. We traveled down Appaloosa Ave. We looked for a while but never saw it again. <BR><BR>When we returned home we told our children but then we said our eyes must have been playing tricks on us as it couldn`t have been what we thought we saw it must have been a tree along the road. My husband told his aunt and uncle and they looked at us like we were crazy, so again my husband said it was a tree. He never talked about it again. I never told anyone either. <BR><BR>Id like to add that when I realized what I was looking at that I was 100-150 feet away. I think it must have heard us when my husband stopped car as the brakes squealed a little.",

    " Just watched a TV show which made reference to the Skunk Ape/Bigfoot of Florida. As I have seen one, I was interested in learning if other sightings had occurred in the same area. While searching for this info, I came across your web site.<BR> <BR>Even though my sighting was 30 years ago, I remember every detail as if it were yesterday. It was early morning (8-ish) New Years day 1978. My sister had picked me up at the Tampa ariport the day before. I was home on leave from the Army. We had spent the evening with friends in Lakeland and set out (6:30-ish) for Ona. <BR><BR>We were driving south on Hwy 37 and had just started across a bridge over the Alafia River. In the passenger seat I had a clear view of the river. On the south side of the river, squatting at the edge of the water was a large dark haired skunk ape. He was splashing water over his shoulder. I yelled for my sister to stop the car as I opened the door to jump out. I ran to the bridge rail. He looked up at me. His features were more human than ape like. He stood up, seeming not afraid at all, looked at me for a moment and then turned and climbed up the bank into the woods. My sister saw him as he entered the woods and was concerned he would come onto the road after us, so we returned to the car and left. <BR><BR>He was big, well over six feet, had a massive chest and arms, and was covered in shaggy dark hair. His face was not as hairy as his body. I did not feel threathened at all. ",

    " My family moved to Charlotte County in 2000, bought a house in a quiet area and have been pleasantly surprised with the amount of wildlife in the area.  We had moved from Ft. Lauderdale and would frequently exercise, bike ride, walk, run or rollerblade.  It was January 2001 or 2002, sunny day, a cold front just went through the area.  It was mid-afternoon, about 65 degrees, wind was out of the North, North East.  I even remember what I was wearing.  My wife and I decided to go Rollerblading that day, and we had a basic route we skated.  As we made our way away from our house we got to one of our favorite roads, Koala, and proceeded down to the end at an easy pace.  About 2-3 blocks from the intersection of Koala and Collingswood we stopped and saw what I first thought was a very large dog, on all four legs, in the swale about 20 ft. from the intersection.  I looked at the animal and I thought I was looking at the profile of a dog, a really BIG dog.  Although I did not see a tail or a head I did not give it another thought.  I remember saying to my wife, \"We should have brought a lead to see if someone lost a dog.  I would hate to see it get hit.  As she was agreeing with me, we just started to move towards the animal and all of a sudden its head rose up and stared right at us.  The animal was not in the swale in a profile view on all fours, it was on all fours facing us.  It had a dark face which did not register with me.  The hair was long, reddish-brown.   As the animal looked up at us there was about a 2 second delay before it took off at an alarming pace.  RIGHT FOR US. Fight or flight sense kicked in. It started running, I looked at it as it gained speed and its hair was flowing in the breeze, there was no standard locomotive process.  It seemed to float.  The shoulders did not break a plane.  We turned around and started to get the heck out of there.  We feared that this animal was after us.  As I kept checking back at it, thinking I may have to confront it, I saw it move from the swale to the roadway effortlessly.  Again it appeared to float up the bank to the road.  Once in the road I could see the hair moving in the wind as it chased after us, I could see the front legs moving but the shoulders never broke a visual horizontal plane.  It took up a quarter of the roadway,  3-4 feet across, I would estimate 4-5 foot at the shoulder.  The animal drifted off into the woods to the north side in to an area that appeared to have been an opening made through the brush.   Maybe we were too close to its lair.  I dont know.  I do not know what it was, I thought perhaps at first it was a dog, then maybe an exotic large cat, or a bear but I ruled them out just due to the unbelievable speed, overall size (huge) and locomotive process this animal executed.  It just appeared to float. The whole thing lasted probably 20 seconds.  I still get the chills thinking about it and when I go past that area.",

    " I was hunting hogs by myself and had been in this area for about 3 hours. I was armed with a Remington model 1100 12ga. shotgun. I was walking between two large Cypress Bayheads in a sawgrass field that was approximately 500 yds. wide by 1/4 mile long. I was looking down at the ground searching for hog tracks. I had seen a group of about 8 hogs approximately 45 minutes earlier, and was trying to outflank them. <BR><BR>I looked up to see how close I was to the Bayhead, when I saw, what at first was just a dark object at the edge of the bayhead. My first thought was that it was a bear. I crouched down and started to advance in order to see it better, and, maybe get a shot at it. When I was approximately 80 to 100 yards away, it stood up on two feet. I froze solid, inside and out! What I saw was NO BEAR! It''s back was to me at first, but after about five seconds, it turned to face me. It was dark brown to black in color, stood approximately 6 1/2ft. high and was VERY solidly built. <BR><BR>I got the height by looking at vegetation where it had stood after the encounter was over. I was able to view the creature for approximately 10 to 15 seconds before it turned and went into the bayhead. I think it took me five to ten minutes just to get my heart rate and breathing back to normal. I forgot all about the shotgun I was carrying! <BR><BR>When I approached the area where it had been, I detected a foul odor lingering in the air. It was like something had soured. The grass was bent down, but there was no bare dirt from which to detect a track. I DID NOT follow it into the bayhead! <BR><BR>I have told only my wife and father of this incident. I had heard, from time to time, about Bigfoot in the Pacific Northwest, but this was the farthest thing from my mind that day. There is a creature in that swamp that is not a bear, not a human. I can''t really say what it is, but I know it exists. <BR><BR>",

    " the date: 3/5/2009 time: 12:00AM Place: In Pasco County going down Gulf Trace towards US Highway 19. I was just going over the bridge close to the Holiday Recreational Center. Well just over the bridge the road curves slightly then straightens out, I had my high beams on like I always do when I pass a wooded area (I am a strong believer in Bigfoot) to try and catch a glimps of the sasquatch, Well that night it paid off! What I saw was a figure about 8 and a half to 9 feet tall and was hair covered, my light had made his eyes glare and he kinda squinted his eyes a little due to the light I am guessing. And I supposed I surprised it as it appeared to be just making its way walking out of the tree line towards the road and thats were I saw him, he stopped instantly when my light hit him (I saw him instantly, as well I slowed down)he backed up into the tree line more and just watched me in a seemingly very curious manner. at that point I had been stopped and due to the angle of my lights not being directly on him anymore, just the peripheral of my lights were on him, all I could see was from his shoulders up. I was speechless and for some reason I called out saying \"Hi!\" and at that point he backed up out of the light and I could hear running off into the woods. I stayed a few more moments and continued on my way. the entire incident from start to end only lasted about a minute thirty. END REPORT",

I was roughly 75ft from the fence when this occurred.  My jack russell dog saw them and took aften them. He often follows me hunting as this place is next to my house.  After chasing them for about 10 mins he comes back towards me when he suddenly stops, looks towards the pine thicket, lets out a weird yelp and takes off towards the house visibly something wrong.  I stood there and heard a noise and the deer that had ran by came back by as if something had spooked them again.  As they came back up the hill I heard what appeared to be a large animal coming from the thicket.  I thought it was another deer that had separated from the herd and was coming back to join up.  As I watched something on two legs appeared roughly 100ft from my position from out of the thicket.  It came down the fence line and went over the fence in the direction of the deer.  I could clearly see that it was on two feet and did not pay me any attention.  I watched it for less than a minute before it disappeared down the hill from me.  <BR><BR>Numerous hunters have reported seeing something of this nature around here before.  I sent in a follow up the other day to tack on to this story but was notified that you never received this story.  My other account happened last week.  It goes as follows. July 1, 2006 that around the hours of 11pm to 12am I walked out on my front porch to encounter weird noises that closely resemble <BR>those on your website.  The sounds came from directly in front of my house down in a hollow on my neighbors land.  They lasted for roughly 3 or 4 minutes. My three dogs became agitated and seemed quite frightened when the noise started.  I myself became somewhat afraid and proceeded back inside.  <BR><BR>I would also like to inform you on a change in email addresses.  As you can see my address now is [removed by editor].

    " well me and my cousin were deep in the woods deer hunting close to our little camp site when we heard some very loud popping sounds maybe 35 yards away, we froze, tried to figure out the sound but couldnt. We started walking it was getting late almost dark we started to smell something. It smelled awful deader than dead my cousin hears something walking heavy, we turn around look down the logging road and see this thing step out of the treeline, it was a good 40 to 45 yards away it had dark brown hair, walked on two legs was very big 9 to 10 feet tall and it just stood there. Out of being so scared we couldnt move either, I couldn''t of shot it if I wanted to but we stared at each other for about 3 or 4 mins and when it took a step into the woods we ran. 1st time ever saw anything like that. I told some people but they laughed and asked me how much I had been drinking but I dont drink so I saw the sight and decided to get this off my chest. I''ve been holding for years and I havn''t been deer hunting that far in the woods since.",

    "  I was walking home from fishing, taking a different trail. As I got about 2/3rds. up the hill I had the hair on my neck stand up and a feeling like I was being watched. This was around 5:00pm. I just casually kept walking till I got home always checking my back. It happened again within a week. Maybe a few days. Did not smell anything cause I had been fishing or no smell anyway. Wasn''t long afterwards I was checking on the clouds of a thunderstorm when lightning struck close to the trailer. By this I mean I had my head out the door. I heard a yell about 70yds. behind the trailer. It didn''t sound like a cow but I checked anyway. No cows had been in the area for at least 6 months. The scream was high pitched without coming down a lot at the end. With my wife being there, I just closed the door and didn''t say nothing. I would say the following Sunday afternoon, my wife went to church at 6:00pm. and I stayed home to watch TV. About 45 min. later, I was laying on the couch watching TV, when something had blacked out my window at the far end of my trailer. The window was 1ft. wide and 3ft. tall. I had raised up to look out my picture window above the couch and it turned the corner and walked around the steps at the back door. It was looking off into the woods and as it kept walking, it looked at the ground.<BR><BR>Understand this though, I had clear plastic on my window to keep heat in from winter.(Hadn''t taken it down yet.) When it got to the window, I had already laid back down on the couch, looking up and lay still. It looked down at me and kept walking, hopefully. I laid there for about as long as I could stand maybe a minute. Then I got off the couch by sliding on the floor, went and got my gun walked back in the living room and waited a minute, then went outside making all noise I could. I checked the back of the trailer, nothing there. Details of Bigfoot is as follows, he was about 7ft. tall maybe 7ft.3\". Solid black, no white or brown that I could see. Remember the plastic. His head was more rounded and not cone shaped. I could not see the color of his eyes or anything like that. He was broad shouldered and thinner around the waist than what you usually see in the pictures and he walked more upright, not humped over like a gorilla. His hands hung around his thighs. The next morning around 10:00am., I got up from bed as I worked 2rd. shift then. My wife told me a friend of mine had come down to see me. I asked what did he want. She said she only saw him as the top of his head went across the kitchen window. We had to set the trailer on 4 blocks high and 3 on the other end, which meant you could not see anyone walking in front of the trailer, not out the kitchen window anyway. I told her my friend was 6''4\" and with a hat on you could not see him the way she had told me. We lived on rocky ground but I had one dusty dirt spot at the end of the trailer. Hoping he had walked in it. I checked and in the middle was a footprint. It was about 12 and a half inches long and 3 and half to 4 inches wide at the heel. Being dust it was only 1/4\" deep. There were only 3 toes which I did not  understand at the time. I told some friends at work and one came to see it. The following Friday or Saturday night, he and a friend of his came over, no drinking sorry. And I told them the whole story. My friend was not hard to convince but his friend started talking big. So I told them let''s go outside. <BR><BR>Joking around to see how brave he was when we heard two dogs about medium to small size started barking and chasing something on the other ridge behind my trailer. Which was not far at all, maybe 200yds. They chased it into the small valley about 50yds. south of us. When one dog quit barking, the other gave one more then it was quiet. Stunned, we looked at each other and Bigfoot started running back towards us. It stopped about 80yds. from us and started to hit a tree with something that sounded like a branch about 4 to 5 inches thick. Then it ran closer to about 40yds. and done the same thing again. By this time all bravery was gone. I went back in the trailer and got my gun. Come back out and asked if anything had happened. The brave guy thought he might had seen something in the shadows south of us, light was on of course. They took the gun away from me and I didn''t mind, thinking I had a way of escape. But we heard nothing else. My nearest neighbor is about 250 yds. away.( Mother-in-law) No one else for at least a mile. No reason to mess with us that I could even think of. That was the last I have seen or heard of him.",

    " I was staying at the Marriott hotel 6th floor in Huntsville Alabama at the Space and Rocket Center-At 5:40am on Feb 24th 2009 I went on the balcony to drink my coffee as the room was too stuffy and hot.  I was out there just thinking and staring off at the woods when something caught my eye--after refocusing on it I realized there were legs, then arms, then I could clearly make out his face.  The creature stood 6-7ft tall and was staring directly back at me-it seemed to have fine hairs all over -grey color hair that got more black as the hair got closer to the skin--the tips of the hair were much lighter--the face (lips, eye lids, etc) were more of a very dark brown-it stood very erect, was very muscular, and did not seem to have the apelike protruding mouth and nose but more flat faced human like--after 30 seconds he started rocking back and forth--I then realized this was moving and could in no way be mistaken for a dear or bear or anything else--this was a fully erect apelike animal that seemed to want me see him --he was rocking back and forth from side to side.  After the initial 30 seconds he rocked for about 10-12 seconds then stood and stared at me --I was on the 6th floor about 120 yards away in decent lighting due to hotel lights and street light behind loading area of hotel-he then would stare back then he would remain face forward with feet only about 2 feet apart would lean over to his left with his right arm would start pulling bark off a very large pine tree--it looked as if someone were in a sawing position--then he would stand up stare at me then rock and then pull bark--this was done in that order 3 times over a 5-6 minute period--after five minutes of re-verifying what I was looking at I felt this creature was docile and smooth moving--I decided I would try and get a closer look--as I opened the sliding glass door he stared and I stared back--I ran out of the hotel room and there was security in our hall laying the morning news at the hotel room doors--I asked him to come with me and asked for back up since he had no gun--we ran around the corner outside - as we were running I Finally got the nerves to tell them what I saw--we get to the reference points I had chosen and there were a lot of fresh bark removed from the large pine tree--I tried to pull bark from it to no avail -- it was too hard--I am 6''4\" 300 lbs.  I went back after 7am (light) -- I did notice what looked like scat --it took the form of explosive diarrhea and looked like a hundred birds had pooped in a small area--like in a shotgun pattern-heavy in the middle and lighter to the outside perimeter-I put a large handful in a Marriott laundry plastic bag--It looks like feces and digested berries and seeds. (It was dry although it had rained the night before)  One of the Marriott employee''s saw two large footprints --more like deep indention''s in the pine straw--I took off my shoe and placed my foot in it and there was about a one inch area all the way around my foot in order to fill the indention--Something very heavy had to make these indention''s--I tried and I am 300lbs and could not.  I am 100% positive of the above discription--I watched this clearly for 5-6 minutes!",

    " I have been reluctant to share my story because of my field of work, and do not want to have people think I am crazy as this could damage my career. But, as I get older, I feel this incident needs to be documented.<BR><BR>The incident occurred in the winter of 1980 a few miles east of Clayton, Alabama in Barbour County. I was traveling with my Aunt, Grandmother and four younger cousins to a relatives house. It was dark and probably around 9pm from the best I can remember. For some reason, my Aunt needed to turn around and proceeded to pull off the roadway by a small clearing. I was in the front seat of the car with my Aunt, who was driving, and my Grandmother. As we turned off the road, the headlights caught a figure in mid-stride. It then immediately froze and did not move anymore. It was about 30 yards from the car  very close. I could see the entire side view of this creature and its body was slightly turned so that it was looking at us. The most terrifying thing in my memory is this things huge eyes glaring at us. The best way I can describe the creatures expression is stunned. The face was covered in hair except for around the eyes. The hair was dark and appeared longer and wavy looking on the arms and legs. It was very tall and massive yet lean looking. I would say it was easily over 7 feet tall, if not more. When it froze in the headlights, one arm was slightly extended behind the creature and it held this position. <BR><BR>At this point, my Grandmother was crying and begging my Aunt to drive away. Two of my younger cousins were huddled on the floorboard in the backseat crying. I was terrified but could not look away.  My Aunt kept telling my Grandmother there is no way he can get in this car and she kept the car still and we watched this motionless creature for about two to three minutes. It was almost completely motionless. It was as if the creature thought we could not see him if he did not move. I dont know how it stood so still. The hair on my neck is standing on end as I type this. It scared me terribly. He kept staring at us with his eyes stretched very wide. Ill never forget that look he gave us.<BR><BR>Finally, my Aunt decided to flash the lights on and off real quick. The instant she did this, the creature jumped towards the woods and was gone. He was about 10 yards from the woods but made it there in less than a second. I cant believe how fast this huge creature could move.<BR><BR>This event traumatized me. I have never been able to go in the woods alone or enjoy camping since this event. I tried to deer hunt but could not enjoy it and quit  I cant sit alone in a tree-stand without thinking of this creature and becoming tense. I cant imagine coming upon this thing alone in the wilderness. I know these creatures exist. There is no doubt in my mind. I saw one up close and personal. We never saw the creature again.<BR>",

    " At the end of January 2013 I was traveling north on Alabama Hwy 51 in northern Coffee County in a rural area approximately one mile south of the Dale County line just before dark. I estimate the time to be around 5 PM. As I approached a left curve I noticed a large dark mass in the road way. At this point I was within one hundred yards of it. Suddenly it moved to my right and in about three steps it was on the shoulder of the road facing me. It was a bipedal creature approximately nine feet tall with a shoulder span approaching four feet with the most intense yellow-green eyes I''ve ever seen spaced six to eight inches apart. In my headlights I could see it was covered in grey-brown hair. The face was ape like with dark brown-black leathery skin. The creature lifted its left arm, possibly to shield its eyes or perhaps anticipating being hit as I was about thirty feet from it. Then I was past it. It took several seconds for the significance of what had occurred to sink in.",

    " On approx. January 5, 2000, three friends and I decided to camp on one of my friend''s land.  We had two fourwheelers and a dog with us.  It was a rainy day and the ground of surrounding area was significantly wet.  We decided to camp anyway.  It stopped raining about dusk when my friend and I started to pitch the tent, while the other two went back to there house for some more supplies.  Mind you we were only camping about a mile from the road and one and a half miles from the landowner''s home.  About ten minutes after their departure me and my friend started hearing strange grunts, foul smell, and heavy footsteps. It went on for about ten minutes, with sounds getting closer and at random, as though the \"animal\" was trying to scare us or get us to make a move. It stopped when my friends arrived back and we dismissed as deer, spooked by our presence. We told of the incident to our friends and the landowner''s son explained that his dad had been experiencing \"strange\" occurences lately.  We went on with our camping and rode four-wheelers for about two hours. When we arrived back at camp, we decided to stay for the rest of the night. About ten minutes after arriving back, the same strange grunts and heavy steps began again. This time they were more aggitated and frequent. The sounds came within at least twenty yards of our camp. The area is heavily wooded so I could not see the animal at this time. The animal was across the creek at the beginning of the sounds and eventually jumped down into the creek, about a seven foot drop, and stayed there making grunts and heavy steps there for about five to ten minutes.  Being very frightened and defensive, I picked up about a ten pound rock and threw it in the vicinity of the animal below in the creek. I could not see the animal due to the foliage. It must have hit the animal because it gave a loud shriek and ran up the creek away from us, then jumping back up on the bank, a seven foot jump, and running back behind our campsite. It then proceeded to make very loud grunts and ran around the back of the campsite about twenty yards away in the woods out or our fire''s sight. It then stopped and we could hear it breathing heavily. Talking amongst ourselves and shouting at the animal, it then made the most blood-curdling scream I have ever heard. I would describe it as high-pitched and seemed to echo everywhere around us. I have heard bobcats and screech owls and can tell you this was not one.  We then proceeded to leave hasitly on our ATVs and went and got the father of my friend. He came back with us and stayed awhile with no occurences. He left and we somehow got ourselves to stay for the night. Nothing happened the rest of the night and we went to sleep. I awoke at 3am to the same grunts and heavy footsteps. This time they were very close. They lasted by my watch til 345am. Not awaking my friends in fear of the animal becoming aggressive, I laid there and listened to this animal. Afterwards, I laid there until sunrise and told my friends of the sounds and occurences of the night. They asked me due to my, as they described, pale face and rattled demeanor. We then went and looked for any evidence of the animal. We found locks of hair in the trees, approx. seven foot high, and numerous large footprints, similar to a humans, but with no arch and a very large great toe. We then proceeded to follow the footprints to where, amonst downed trees and foliage, we found where a large animal had been laying. We found hair there also. We continued to trail the animal''s leavings when came across the same sounds of footsteps. They were too scared to go over the hill and see the animal making the noise so they told me to. Reluctantly I did, and saw a large upright creature, approx. seven to eight feet tall, walking with its back to me. It was covered in hair, black to dark brown, and had an awful smell. It turned and alarmed by my presence ran away from me. I then turned and ran away from it towards my friends who I shouted to to run. They got up and ran and we ran back to our campsite and stayed there where I told them what I saw.  For a few months after that we heard the same grunts and shrieks down the creek where we camped that night. We frequently rode ATVs down there and an occurence was frequent. Occurences also happened at other places, two to three miles away from the area of occurence. A sighting was also reported at a park about a mile up the road from my house, three miles from the creek. We also found footprints in nearby rock quarry. My brother and I also saw a \"brown\" animal, who we thought to be a man at first, but, trailed him to find that could not have been a man, on hunting land a mile from our house. No occurences have happened in the past three years. But, I also don''t ride or camp as much, either.<BR>",

    " My brother and I were on our family farm playing in the woods as usual.  We were in a heavily wooded area with thick underbrush in a valley behind our tobacco barn playing in the stream that ran along one side of the barn.  We were collecting rocks and making a dam for a swimming hole for the next summer''s use.  It was late in the afternoon- almost dusk.  I kept having one of those \"gut feelings\" that something wasn''t \"right\" but I couldn''t put my finger on it, so we kept working. I had mentioned my feeling to my brother.  I crossed the stream with a jump holding a large field rock and heard a stick break loudly.  I looked under my feet and there was nothing but leaves and mud, I looked back across the stream at my brother who wasn''t near any dead fall.  I also had a severe wake up call in my gut to get out of there.  I placed my rock and told my brother we had to get out of there immediately, something wasn''t right.  He didn''t protest as his hackles were also raised by that time.  <BR><BR>I retrieved my rifle from the tree across the creek where we''d left our \"weapons\" (pump BB air rifles, we didn''t get shotguns till the next Christmas) and walked to the 4 foot woven wire fence we had to cross.  I set my BB gun down on the other side of the fence and grabbed some low hanging tree limbs to assist my getting across the fence.  Once I dropped down on the other side I turned toward the barn to pick up my BB gun.  I came eye to eye with a... thing.  A huge black, hairy thing crouched down slightly behind an old tree.  It had huge black eyes and needless to say scared the beegeesus out of me.  I screamed my brother''s name at the top of my lungs and started pumping my BB gun for all it was worth, I intended to shoot it in the eyes if it moved.  My brother was about 15 yards from me on the other side of the fence retrieving his BB gun.  My next thought was run for help so I took off for the clearing some 50 yards away.  My brother says he looked at me after I screamed (a bloodcurdling scream he says) and says I was literally as white as a sheet and thought \"what the hell''s wrong with her?\"  He then fired his BB air gun because it was a long pistol type model that he stuck through his belt.  Then he said he looked up across the creek and saw the thing- only it was out from behind the tree, standing fully erect now.  My brother cleared a 4 foot fence in one bound with 2 pair of long underwear and a pair of jeans on and he wasn''t much taller than the fence at the time. <BR> <BR>Meanwhile I''d made it to the clearing and turned toward the woods with my gun ready, looking for any sign of my brother.  I was never so glad in my life to see a hunter''s orange sock cap bobbing my way.  I was crying and screaming for him hysterically.  He ran up to me and said he''d heard it chasing him, but it didn''t follow him out of the woods, yet anyway.  We ran the whole rest of the way back to the farm house which was about 1/4 mile across a main road.  When we reached the house and \"fell in the door\" as my aunt says, we told her and my cousin about our encounter.  They laughed it off nervously and my aunt then confessed to many sightings and strange occurrences through the years in the area.  She told us a man had disappeared off a bridge on a tractor just below (less than 500 yards downstream) where we''d been when she was a child.  Said the tractor was found overturned in the creek, but the man never was. <BR><BR>",

    " The reason I never told anyone was because I found it hard to believe myself, much less what other people would say or think about me. <BR><BR>I recently began working at an ARMY hospital and befriended someone who had a very near experience with what was considered a juvenile Sasquatch. After 17 years that night is still very vivid and etched in my mind. With the help of Google earth maps I was able to find the exact spot that I had my encounter back in December 17, 1997. It was just as I had remembered and as I had described to my friend. The first time I saw it, again after all these years, the hair on my arms and neck stood on end and a cold chill ran through me. Amazing! After 17 years and never having told anyone I experienced that night over.<BR><BR>It was December 17, 1997 my friend had wanted to take me to this spot that she said looked spectacular under a full moon. We reached the spot that had a clearing of deforested area to the right with a 45 degree grade. The road was cut against the mountain edge and it was a spectacular view with a fresh coating of snow that had fallen. The section of the road had a landing cut at the end of the curve and we had backed up into the landing where we could see any oncoming traffic. We had been there approximately an hour and the cab in my truck had gotten a little too cold so I turned on the truck and put the heater vent on. My friend had noticed something in the road when the windshield defrosted, we were staring at a full grown male boar that was rooting through the snow on the edge of the road. This thing was huge and it made me regret not having my rifle or bow with me. It was one of those chance of a lifetimes seeing something like that just 60 to 70 yards away. We were downwind from him and we must have watched that boar root for about 10 minutes when all of a sudden it sniffed the air and was gone. It ran like it feared for its life across the road and up the left side of the mountain that had the same 45 degree grade going uphill. <BR><BR>My friend and I both wondered what wouldve made it run like that. I turned the truck off and we listened for any kind of noise that could have spooked him. We both talked about what wouldve made it run away like that. She joked that it was probably a black bear since they were common sightings out there. Maybe 5 minutes had passed when she peered out the windshield and pointed to the tree line and told me to look. She and I both thought it was a black bear and with the tree line in the background it was really hard to make out the shape. It wasnt until it was approximately at the same spot the boar was and it was standing upright that I had to really strain to see what I thought I was seeing. We were still downwind from the spot where it was standing and had not noticed us yet. It was standing upright but it seemed it was looking at the ground as if tracking the boar. I watched it for a good 5 minutes and I tried to tell myself that everything in my mind was negating that it was not a black bear. First black bears do not stand and rear up unless provoked or if they need the height to look at something in the distance. Second, if it does stand up it does not walk a good 20 to 25 yards on two legs like this form did coming out of the tree line up a 45 degree slope. Third, when bears rear up on their hind legs their front arms and feet come towards the center of their mass and this form had long arms that swung at its side. As it stood over the spot where the boar had been rooting I was staring in disbelief. Mind you, my friend and I had not been drinking and neither one of us smokes, so there was nothing in our systems that could have created this image. There was a complete full moon but it was behind the form so all I could really see was the outline of it and I strained to see its face and form a little better.  I reached to the left side of my dash and pulled on the light knob and then the high beams. There stood a figure approximately 8 to 8.5 feet tall. I could see the steam of its breath as it folded its left arm over its face and blocked my high beam light from its face. It stood there frozen as if he were trying to figure out what was causing this light. It looked puzzled and tried to see between its fingers at my truck but the lights must have really blinded it because it kept dodging its head back and forth to get a better look at us. We were at a stale mate; I was in disbelief at what I knew I was looking at and it was in disbelief at these two lights that were peering at him from the darkness. He tried to move to the side and the lights still bothered him because in an instant his face went from puzzlement to one of anger. I remember seeing his eyes. His eyes were this glowing amber red color and his brow was frowned which only intensified more the longer the lights shined upon him. He grunted and the steam from his mouth was a great billow of smoke caused from his hot breath hitting the cold midnight air. It looked like he was going to take steps toward the truck and I laid in on the horn. I remember his body shuddering at the noise and he turned towards the same general area the boar had run up. It took three strides for him to cover approximately 20 feet of road way and he reached up for the base of a small sapling grabbed it and propelled himself up the mountain and in a matter of 2 seconds he was gone from sight.<BR> <BR>I sat there almost in disbelief looking up the side of the mountain where he vanished. My heart was beating fast and I had these cold chills that scared me to the core. At this time I looked over at my friend and asked if she had just seen that. Her eyes were big as saucers, her mouth was open and shaking, and couldnt make a noise. I reached over and touched her arm and she pulled it back hard. It was at this moment that I realized she had urinated in her jeans and she was afraid. Now let me tell you this girl was a mountain girl. Been hunting and fishing with her daddy since she was a little girl. She knew firearms, she knew how to hunt and fish and could hang with the best of them. She knew how to skin a dear, baited her own hooks, and cleaned her own fish. She knew how to rough it out in the wild and had been on hundreds of hunting and camping trips. This was by no means a girl that would scare easily. EVER! She never even looked at me she just screamed to get out of there and take her home. I tried reaching out to her and she pulled away. I knew her enough to know not to try further and I started the truck up. When the heater started up there was a stench that filled the truck cab. Something like strong urine and an odor of mixed sweat, and strong body odor. It was awful and made us both gag. I rolled down the window and the fresh air outside wasnt any better. It took about a mile or two with the window rolled down to get that smell out. <BR><BR>I drove up to her drive way and she got out without saying a word. Not a glance back or nothing. I drove home and didnt sleep that night at all. The following day I grabbed my 30-06, my 9mm, hunting knife, some binoculars and headed back to the spot we had been at the previous night. I found the same spot but another dusting of snow had hidden any trace of the hog or the Sasquatch. I drove close to the road edge back and forth still kind of scared of exiting my truck. I eventually parked on the side of the road and traced the trail that the boar and Sasquatch had. My rifle in my hands with the safety off, my 9 at my side unclipped and with the safety off, and I was still uneasy. I walked back and forth and never found anything other than divots in the snow where he had walked and even though I took pictures when I developed them there was nothing conclusive. Thinking back now I failed to measure the distance from one divot to the other because there were easily 3 of my strides between snowed in divots. I did find the sapling that he had grabbed to catapult himself up the mountain and it was broken at the base but nothing there for me to collect. I must have sat in my truck for an hour or two still in disbelief. I finally cranked up my truck and swore Id never say a word to anyone and to this date I never had until I met someone with an incredible story like mine.<BR><BR>A little background on me. I am a Texas bred and born man. I have hunted, fished, and camped all my life. I have taken down big game in Mexico, Texas, New Mexico, Tennessee, and Florida. I know what foxes, coyotes, wolves, deer, elk, and full grown bears look like. I am a former United States Marine, Desert Storm War Era veteran. Im the kind of man that would tell people I could walk up to the devil, spit in his eye and ask him for a light. I am not a glory seeker as I could have been telling this story for years but have never done so prior meeting this gentleman at work. He asked me to sit down and draw what I saw and it was with amazing accuracy that I was able to draw everything I saw that night including the eyes. The eyes burned and glowed in the night like two red hot coals peering from behind this massive hand. Ill never forget that look of those eyes.<BR>",

    " It was unusually warm to be mid-December on this day and me and my buddy was hunting in a area known as Chilhowee. It was about a hour before sunset when we climbed out of our deer stands. I met my buddy in a little holler about 100 yards from both of our tree stands. <BR><BR>We were walking back to the 4 wheeler when we heard a very low rumble in the holler we had just met in. We were now at this time about 35 yards from the holler almost in a field, so we thought we would be real still and sit on the edge of the field for a minute and see if we could hear anything else. At this time we were thinking it was just a grunt or a blow from a deer that we had scared.<BR><BR>We wated probally 10 minutes before we heard a loud splash in a little drinking hole, me and my buddy looked at each other and said what the hell is that. So we wated another minute, still hoping that a deer would come out then we heard a second splash. At this time we realized it wasnt a deer. so we walked probally 20 yards and saw what we believe is a bigfoot.<BR><BR>It was aproximately 7 to 8 feet tall and I would say weighed 300-350 pounds just guessing.  Me and my friend were almost in shock at what we had scene. The bigfoot saw us and actually didnt seem to care that we were watching it.  He kind of just lingered around the area for another minute before walking over a small ridge where we lost sight of it and to be honest we were to scared to go and look for it so we went back to the house and told everybody there, but they said we were crazy and it was just a bear.<BR><BR>I have been hunting bear for years and I am familiar with their movements.  This was no bear.  I know this because it never dropped down on all four of its feet the whole time we watched it and we probally saw it walk a total of only 30-40 yards but I am 100 % sure it was no bear.  It was some sort of human ape creature I am positive it was a sasquatch and so is my buddy. ",

I muted the t.v and went out on the porch to see if i could hear it. i noticed that the dogs that normally barking were unusually quiet. My cousin said why don''t you do a call to see if you can get a response. So I did a howl and got no response i stood on my porch for about 10 minutes and figured if there was a bigfoot in the area it probably moved on by then. I was just about to go back in the house when I noticed something moving behind a large pine tree that stands in our yard. I stood there for a moment because I thought the chickens might be roosting in the tree when I seen the sasquatch peek around the tree. I saw it and it saw me, our eyes met and he stepped out from behind the tree I ran inside but watched through the open door it kept watching me, then in 3 large steps was across the road and faded into the darkness. It had long brown hair. I measured where it stood after. and where its head was, using the pine tree for scale, I measured ten feet 2 inch tall there was one foot print in the yard I didn''t have any casting supplies so I took a picture of it and measured the foot print at 17 inches.

    " My sister and I, while traveling home through Wickliffe bottoms in Kentucky at night (apx. 2:30 am), observed a large object on the side of the road.  As the headlights shined on the object and it became closer, we were both stunned at what we saw before us.  My sister was driving and I was in the passenger seat. The creature was on my side and as the car passed it, I couldn''t have been more than 2 to 3 feet from it''s body. There was a large manlike creature with long, shiny dark hair covering it''s entire body. With very distinctive muscle tone definition in it''s legs and arms, this thing looked very strong.  It''s face was what startled me the most because it had human like features especially the eyes..not like any animals'' eyes i''d ever seen before (and I''ve been a hunter all of my life).  It was at least 8 foot tall because as we passed it, it''s upper torso towered well above the top of the vechicle which was a Ford Escort.  The creature was standing half in the ditch and half on the road as if it was trying to cross.  And when it looked at us, it''s eyes followed us as we passed.  At this point, my sister and I remained silent for at least 3 to 4 minutes after we first laid eyes upon it, as if we were seeing something we shouldn''t be seeing. Then I looked at my sister and she looked at me, simutaneously we said \"What the hell was that?\".  As we got home, we spoke about it for the next 15 or 20 miles and decided how rediculous this must sound but we had thought we had just witnessed the wolfman.  But make no mistake, it had the face of a man covered with hair, not the snout of a wolf.  It was a frightening experience, yet an intriguing one that my sister and I will never forget and still talk about to this day. <BR>",

    " Three friends and myself were camping out the night before the opening morning of deer season Nov.7 to be exact. We had set up camp in an area known as Lonesome Woods which covers about three counties. It was really cold and we had a really big fire going and we were all sitting around it to stay warm, when all of a sudden this weird moaning sound filled the woods. It sounded kind of like a siren except it was very loud. It let off a series of three moans starting low building and then dropping, pitch as well as volume, in three bursts. <BR><BR>This scared us because we all grew up in this area and have hunted and camped out here all of our lives and have never heard such a cry. Not wanting to act scared we tried to laugh it off but an uneasy feeling lingered throughout the camp for quite a while. That happened about 9:00. <BR><BR>About 10:30 T., one of my friends who was camping with us, stepped out into the woods to relieve himself. He wasn''t gone for about 10 minutes when he came running back to camp saying \"I''m gone and if you all have any sense you''d leave to\".  We asked him what was wrong and he told us he had seen something down by the creek located on the other side of the hill. It stood about 8 feet tall and appeared to be drinking from the stream as he came across the hill. Once on top of the hill it took notice of him stood up and watch him, or as T. said \"watched me run.\" T. hadn''t much more than got the words out of his mouth when we heard a something running through the brush on top of a hill. My brother had a mining light (plus it was very bright from the moon that night, the sky was spotless)shined up on the hill to see a silhouette of a very large creature running on top of the hill. <BR><BR>We couldn''t make out a color but it was human shaped with long arms and ran kind of hunched over. It looked to be about 8 feet tall. The sound it produced while running was amazingly loud it sounded as though a truck was being driven over a road of branches and twigs. This was enough for us, scared out of our wits we packed up what little we had and left. we have heard a lot of stories about this area and now we believe them there is something in those woods without a doubt. <BR><BR>",

    " I was driving north down Brownsville Road towards State Route 16 with a girlfriend. We were both cheerleaders and were heading to Licking Valley High School for a game. We were driving fast down the road coming up to the Claylick area. As we approached the area we saw something very hairy and very large squatting in the middle of the road. Since the road was very narrow, I decided to drive towards it so I wouldn''t go off the road into the creek. At a distance of ten feet away, I waited for an impact but surprisingly nothing happened. Apparently it jumped out of the way or maybe even rolled out of the way. When I looked in my rear view mirror, it was gone. I have know idea where it went and didn''t stop to see. When we finally drove about a  mile down the road, we finally spoke to each other. My friend and I tried to decide if that was a dog, a bear, etc but nothing met the description. Judging by what I saw of the animal, it was baboon like in appearance but much larger in size.<BR><BR>",

    " My girlfriend and I were driving home from work in the winter of 2003. We had several inches of snow, so we were moving slow. I was driving down State RT 56.  I looked to the farm field on my left and noticed something walking along the creek. I slowed down to get a better look and asked my girlfriend if she could see what I was watching.  She said yes.  I pulled our truck over as far as I could get and got out.  I walked across the road to get a better look.  What we saw plain as day was covered in reddish brown hair, walked upright, had a conical shaped head, long arms, stocky build and was at least six feet tall.  We watched this thing for several minutes until we had cars backed up.  I got back into the truck and we turned off of the road to the next left where the creek crossed and the ditch turned into a small thicket which is the direction what we both agreed, without a doubt was bigfoot, was heading.  We waited till it got dark to see if anything came out.  Nothing did.  We went to both entrances of the farm fields and saw no tracks of anything.  I am an avid hunter and fisherman and have no trouble distinguishing camoflage from hair at the distance the subjet was from us, which was about two hundred yards.  We only recently told our family and close friends  about what we saw.       ",

    " My husband and I were driving home down Winchester Southern Rd toward St Rt 22 around 9:00pm on 12/20/2019. It was completely dark outside by this time. We were going around 60mph. My husband was on high alert for deer. We were just talking to each other when we approached the right hand turn off to Wyandotte Rd. My husband fell silent. He saw a very large, very tall, bipedal creature running toward the road from the left hand side. Within a split second I also saw this creature as it continued approaching the road at a full run. It entered into the peripheral of our headlights and came within 2-3 feet of the driver side window. <BR><BR>Comparing the creature to our truck, it had to have been nearly 8 feet tall, as it was slightly slouched while running and was a head taller than our truck. It had blondish red fur and domed shoulder/head area.<BR> <BR>Since we were going around 60 mph as all of this happened, it ended up barely missing our truck and crossing the road behind us. We didnt speak for 15-20 seconds until my husband finally said What was that?! We immediately turned around and traveled down Wyandotte Rd, in the direction it went behind us, but did not see or hear anything. We also used a spotlight from the truck to look along the road on both sides where we initially saw it but did not see any disturbance.

    "           My friend  lives outside of Cardington. It was about 6:00 P.M. when I got to his house and we decided to build a small camp fire just for the sake of fun. He lives right next to a small wooded cliff that follows a tiny  river. Right behind his house next to the cliff that leads into the small woods is his security light that stays on all night. It was about 9:40 P.M. that night and we had a really good camp fire going when he said we are just about out of wood do you think you could take the flash light and pick up some small twigs to keep this fire going. At the time I really didnt think anything of it and being a hunter and all Im not scared of going into a woods at night. So, I said sure and took the flash-light and proceeded down a cut path on the face of the hilly cliff. The first step I took heading down that hill I will never forget for the rest of my life. As I took my first step onto the path I saw a massive black object/thing at the bottom of the cliff in a wall of weeds taller than me. Now, Im about 6 1 and this black thing was a good 8 feet in height or taller. The weeds at the bottom were it stood are a good 7 in height or longer themselves. With said, I just stood there froze in fear asking the same question in my head what the hell is it? <BR>         As I stood there it just moved side to side like a large animal studying its pray for the kill. At that time it looked up at me with its red eyes and that is when my heart dropped to the bottom of my small intestine. The red eyes on this thing glowed off the security-light at the top of the cliff and I was just scared shitless. After about two minutes of just standing their motionless, I finally managed to move my arm in a backwards motion to touch my friend on the shoulder. When I did that Josh said what and turned towards me where he got a fearful look at this thing as well. He then yield shit and took off for the door to his house leaving me just standing their thinking o-shit he just left me hear by myself with this thing. About that time this large bear/human looking thing just took off running in a mad run for the riverside; crossing it towards the field on the other side. When that happened I took off towards the house door as I fell over myself just turning around.<BR>          As for what I seen that night I really cant say. But I do know one thing and that is it was no person or animal Ive ever seen. I would also just like to add that later this past week myself, my friend, and some college friends took a walk down into the woods in the middle of the night where we discovered and photographed three large footprints coming up out of the river bed.<BR>",

    " My brother, dad and I had spent the day hunting behind our home. A ravine ran through the deep woods where we were fox hunting. The pelts brought a good price in those days. I was about 11 years old. While we hunted I had noticed large tracks in the snow. I tried to report it to dad but he was a very intense hunter and ignored me. As my brother and I drove the ravine I had this strange feeling of being watched. We had no luck that day and headed back home. We usually unloaded our rifles in the back yard before going inside. It was at this time that my brother yelled, \"look.\" He was pointing to the back of the pasture behind the house. I saw something that I cannot explain. At first we thought we were looking at a bear lumbering on all fours but then it stood up. It was very tall and it was covered in a brownish fur. The fur on its arms was rather long. I could see the fur hanging from its arms as it reached out to touch the pasture fence in a posture more like a man. Then it stepped over a five foot fence and walked off into the heavy thicket completely out of sight. The pasture was owned by Jay Baker who is now deceased. My brother always called this the, \"Freak of Nature Bear.\" I have never seen anything like this since. There was a creek that ran through the part of the pasture where the creature was sighted. This was also where I first had spotted the tracks. I have told this story many times since to various friends.  ",

    " During rabbit season in 1976 myself and four other went hunting just off Stanhope Kellogsville Road. It was one of the worst days to go hunting. It was snowing and unbelievably cold. We had been in the woods a couple of hours when I got seperated from the rest of the hunting party. The next thing I remember is a very loud sound like a freight train coming threw the woods. All I got was a five-second look at what ever it was it was. It was huge in size and running on two feet full steam ahead. There was no one else around. I do believe they were in front of me by a hundred yards. I told them about it when I caught up too them and they just laughed and said it was a deer. It was no deer and I have been hunting for 26 years. I have never been so scared in my life even though I stood there with a loaded shot gun. ",

    " It was in 1978 or around then that my brother and I saw Bigfoot. It was the year we got hit with so much snow that year. We were coming back from our friends house as young boys (10 and 8 years old). The snow was very deep as we had to lift up our legs very high to get through the snow. As we were finally getting through the thick woods behind our house and walking into our property, there stood a Bigfoot staring the other way. My brother and I were shocked to see him, just standing out in the middle of our yard looking the other way. We heard about it before and our very first thought was that he might attack us. I told my brother to start reaching for a stick under the deep snow so we can defend ourselves. The Bigfoot was probably about 30 feet away from us. It stood nearly straight up, but with a little hunch. Its height was around 6 1/2 feet tall with a build similar to a human frame. The Bigfoot long brown hair on him, but not too thick as it was possible to see some skin under his fur. As were trying to pull out the stick from the snow, the Bigfoot heard the noise and quickly turned around and looked at us in the eyes. At that time, I was very scared. Our hearts were racing and we were shaking. For about five seconds or so he stared at us and we at him. His facial feature looked like a mix between a human and an ape. He didn''t have more of a flatter face but slightly darker colored and thick skinned like an ape. After the stare down, it suddenly turned around and with super human abilities ran around the house in a just a few seconds at the most. The snow was deep, but it ran down our property and took a left turn around the house. It was like the snow never existed as he moved so quickly. I was totally amazed how lighting quick he was. It took huge long steps....that convinced us we saw a Bigfoot. Even if someone was playing a trick on us, there is no one in this world that can run through deep snow in a matter of seconds. This was the convincing point for us. But it''s not over. After my brother and I made it back to the house, we yelled for our parents, but of course they didn''t believe us at all. Two boys watching monster movies, yeah right... who would believe us! But later that night we heard him again. But this time he was walking on the porch around our house. I heard the snow smashing down as it walked on our porch....crunch, crunch, crunch.. and so on until it stopped right behind my window. We had bunk beds and I was on the top and my brother on the bottom. There was a small push window immediately behind my head, I could feel its presence behind me. I think (but are not sure), it was looking in the window at me. I had sooo many goose bumps on my body, I just jumped out of my bed as quickly as possible thinking he was going to ram his hand through the window to drag me out. As I ran out my brother also followed me and we raced into the living room where our dad always falls a sleep at night on the couch. We yelled that Bigfoot was out there again and of course Dad told us to go back to bed and quit fooling around, it was past our bed time. We kept yelling to him that we were serious, so he got up and looked out the sliding doors. He couldn''t see anything outside and told us to go back to bed. We were too scared so we sleep in the living room on the floor. <BR><BR>My brother and I never thought about going back outside that same day we saw Bigfoot and look for footprints. Everybody asks us that, but it just never dawned on us to do that. As the years roll by the images and details get more sketchier in my mind. But I am 100% convinced we saw him that day. The solid evidence for me is that he ran through that deep snow in just a few seconds. I''m a fairly serious runner and I know for a fact, that is totally impossible to run through the snow that quick. Bigfoot reminds me of a Heron Bird, you can never get too close to it and it quickly takes off to hide. With the woods and parks by the house and Nelson ledges somewhat close by, I think he maybe hiding in at Nelson Ledges in the caves in the ground. But that''s just a hunch. Personally, I have a hard time believing myself at times, because I do not believe in evolution, but at the same time I am absolutely positive I saw him. I don''t think we are going to ever find him unless we directly go out looking for him. So many people tell me they don''t believe in it because no one has ever found a dead Bigfoot in the forest. But I say that it''s just like the many animals in the world, we don''t see them laying all around the yard either. If we found Bigfoot though, it sure would be the catch of the century! The world would change dramatically if we were able to study them closely. Good Luck, I think your website will help pinpoint there locations.<BR><BR>",

They were about eight feet in height and muscular. One was banging on a tree and the other was digging in the snow. We could smell them  - it was very foul.

    " I was fifteen or sixteen at the time, 1958, and running a trapline on a creek west and south of Adario, Ohio. It was my third or fourth year of trapping. My dog, Smokey, always went with me and usually chased rabbits while I was checking my traps. That morning, before going to school, I set out to check my traps with a near full moon lighting up the sky. It was a very cold morning. As I started down the Adario West Road toward the creek, Smokey started acting strange and wouldn''t leave my side. He started growling a real deep growl, just barely audible. At each spot where I had a trap set, Smokey would sit on top of the bank while I went to check my traps. I was nearing the end of my trap line when I had to go down a steep bank to retrieve a muskrat in one of my traps. This time Smokey came down the bank with me and sat facing up the bank, his growling growing louder. I was just getting ready to reset the trap when an errie feeling came over me. I turned to look up the bank (Smokey had ceased growling and was leaning against me)and saw something I had never seen before until many years later in a documentary on ''Big Foot''. Whatever it was stood approx. seven feet tall and was all covered with long hair, except its face. The face was not exactly human, but not animal either. And there seemed to be some kind of foul odor in the air.<BR>Needless to say, it scared me half to death, but I think I also might have surprised it at the same time. In just seconds it turned and half walked, half ran away. I started up the bank a few seconds later and reached the top of the bank in time to see ''it'' cross a six foot high gate leading into a field, without even touching it. I watched it lumber through the field for a minute or so to make sure it wasn''t going the direction I had to go, and then started for home. Unfortunately, there was no snow on the ground and the ground was frozen pretty hard. I didn''t even think to look for tracks at the time, but thought about it in school later in the day. I decided to go back out and look for tracks after school, but as luck would have it we got about four inches of snow before I got home from school.<BR>I didn''t tell my parents or anyone else because I didn''t want to loose my freedom to trap and knew my mom would come unglued if she knew about it. I waited several days before checking my trap line again for fear of running into it again, but never did see anything like it again. There are a lot of small woodlots in that area, but nothing of any great size because it is farm country with roads as close as one mile apart. I have no idea where something like that could have lived undetected by someone, sometime. I didn''t find out until the early nineties that there had ever been any ''sightings'' of such a creature anywhere in Ohio.

    " My sighting first took place on my property in February of 2009. I had numerous contacts along with various evidence found and seen on the ten heavily wooded acres where I reside. <BR><BR>1st sighting. Feb 6th approximately 11:30 PM.<BR><BR>Went out on the back deck to smoke a cigarette. There was a full moon and around 4inches of snow on the ground. The temperature was in the single digits. My family have been living at this location and I am familiar with the wildlife and sounds in the woods. I first heard movement in the woods that sounded like something extremely large. The snow was crunching and large branches and small trees were being broken. ( loud cracks like a gun fire) I was saying aloud: \"what the hell is out there!). As it moved closer I could see some of the smaller tree tops shaking. This activity continued until it was about 20 feet from the woodline. At that point it stopped. The full moon reflecting off the snow illuminated the entire area enough to play a baseball game but I could not see what was within the woodline. I vocalized aloud: \" why can''t I see it\". Then another ash tree began to shake near the fence line. The ten acres of woods on my property is surrounded by another 50 heavily wooded acres as well so there is plenty of mature forest and dense cover. Then I heard a loud crack and a small ash tree slowly fell along the fence line. I still did not have a clue as to what this could be. (bigfoot did not even come into consideration). After the tree fall I went into the house, locked the door and went upstairs to alert my wife and see if we could get a better look from the second floor window. I woke my wife and raised the window facing the wooded area. My wife and I both could hear movement in the woods which was clearly bi-pedal, again large branches breaking. My wife suggested that I go out in the morning and look for prints in the snow to identify it. We do not have bear in this region of Ohio so I was mystified as to what it could be. <BR><BR>The next morning I went out to investigate and discovered 9inch wide by 17 inch long bigfoot tracks. I could not believe it! I used a carpenters square and to reference the size and took digital pictures of the foot prints in the snow.<BR><BR>I followed the tracks thru the woods which looked like a tornado passed through. 6inch diameter hardwood trees broken over, briar brush flattened ending at the 5 foot tall barbed wire fence at the rear of my property crushed down to a foot high. The barb wire was broken and stretched out straight as a frozen rope. We have a heavy deer population and I believe it was pursuing a deer. I found a hair sample on the barb wire. ( concealed as evidence in a zip lock bag. )<BR><BR>From there I found additional tracks which lead me to a fresh deer kill. There is no hunting on my property or the adjacent properties. The first thing that I noticed was the legs on the deer had been removed and the lower jaw was ripped off . All of the internal organs were missing yet no entrails or blood were found. I taking pictures of deer carcass and the bigfoot prints near the deer when I noticed the lower portions of the deer legs stacked together against a large tree. all of the legs were in the same direction like a bundle of dowel rods and there was clearly an imprint in the snow where ths sasquatch sat down in the snow against this tree and enjoyed his meal and neatly stacked the lower portions by the tree. At that point I turned to take a picture for evidence when a large stick flying end over end hit me on the back of my head and knocked my ball cap off. Thats when I realized this bigfoot is still out here. I grabbed my cap and ran out of the woods to the house. This story is just the beginning of an amazing six months of encounters and upclose sightings of an eight foot tall bigfoot that was very comfortable on my property and my family. I would be happy to share the other experiences and the evidence that I have collected.  ",

    " My husband and I were on our way home late one night when I saw the headlights of the car shine on something crossing the road.  I shouted to my husband \"DID YOU SEE THAT?\" He said, \"See what?\" I was all excited and couldn''t believe that he didn''t see it, but he had a good reason, he was focused on the steep hill and curve we were about to drive up and it was late and dark out.  We drove down Cherry Street in Germantown that turns into Diamond Mill on the outskirts of town. There is a fork in the road at Little Twin Road.  We go this route frequently when we go to my mother''s in Middletown from our home off of Diamond Mill located on the outskirts of Farmersville and we come home the same direction.  We were on the way home when I saw this creature.  I was in total shock that night when I saw something really tall with long straight hair all over, dark rusty brown, and had a long stride as it crossed the road.  I was trying to see if it were a hunter dressed in some hunting outfit, but then remembered that it was March and NOT hunting season.  I told others of this sighting and was made fun of repeatedly until my neighbor just told me this morning of seeing the bigfoot in the same area.  I was elated that finally someone else saw what I saw in the same location!  I now travel with my camera ready in that area!",

It just stood there so I started to walk in the other direction when it let out a screeching howl. I stopped and my heart was racing and I couldn''t breath.

As my lights hit it as with out thinking it turned back the way it had come very swiftly, but another interesting thing that i noticed was as it tuned to go back into the swampy area I could plainly see the entire bottom of its foot wich was very  very large and light in contrast to the rest of the creature and void of any fur/coat would very much put you in the mind of a humans foot only much much larger. and within just flash was gone.I did stop the following day to see if I could see any kinda of tracks and saw nothing but the composition of the ground would probably not yeild a good footprint next to the road as for the marshy area I didnt venture in..Very strange indeed.",

    " It was an unusually warm February that year and me and 3 other friends of mine decided to go out and spend the night in the strip mines to kind of get away from things and shoot guns and just have a little fun without disturbing anyone. We arrived at the pull off about noon and proceeded to hike the 2 miles to where Crystal lake was located. When we arrived at the lake we set up a small fire and our sleeping bags on a small knoll overlooking the lake and then went down the hill to an old road and walked about a mile or so when my friend Darren found a large footprint in the clay-like mud off the side of the road, we all were amazed at how big this print was, I wear a size 12 boot and it was at least 4 inches longer than my boot. It was a very fresh track, so fresh Icould make out the loops and swirls on the pads of the toes and part of the sole. We got really nervous and a little scared because we all had a lot of experience in the woods hiking and hunting and none of us had ever believed or seen anything about Bigfoot, but We changed our minds very quickly after seeing that print. We made our way back to the camp and sat around the fire and just kind of took it all in and discussed what we had found and tried to dismiss it and go on with our trip. Later on in the evening we heard nromal woodland creatures and birds but it got very quiet and nothing made a sound for hours. We were getting scared and wondered if we should leave but curiosity got the best of us and we decided to stay the rest of the night. We ate dinner about 7p.m. and sat around the fire and talked until at exactly 11:23 p.m.(I will remember the exact time as long as I live)we heard what can be described as a cross between a bark and a scream came from below our camp near the lake shore, it was the most unnerving thing I have ever heard we all just sat and stared at each other unable to talk or move. This went on for about 5 minutes until about a half mile away we heard another answer the first with a series of high pitched barks and screams. That is when we decided it was time to go home, but we were afraid to leave the same way we had come because we would have had to walk past the area where we had heard the scream at first. We decided to walk up another level and skirt the cliffs around the back of the lake but when we make up to the steppe above us we ran right into whatever it was making the sound, I was in front and had a Maglite, the beam hit the midsection of the creature and I stopped dead in my tracks. I observed a seven to eight foot tall creature standing not more than 10 feet away from me as I shined the light up I seen red eyes. I have hunted all sorts of animals and I have never seen one with red eyes that seemed to glow in the light. I back stepped and almost knock over everyone behind me and the creature ran up an embankment and we all ran back to the fire and sat back to back until we decided to go ahead and go back to the road and make our way to the car. We made it to the raod and started walking the 2 miles to the car all the while listening to the 2 creatures yelling and screaming one was behind us and the other was on our right flank pacing us from about 10 to 15 yards. Earlier in the day we had passed a huge pile of old tires someone had dumped, But when we got to that point of the road about 30 of the tires were thrown out into the road like someone or something didn''t want us to leave. When we made it to the car we  all piled in and left as fast as the car would go. We never discussed it with anyone or even among ourselves because we were afraid of ridicule and people thinking we were crazy.",

I was convinced<BR>that my wife and son had seen the samething, as<BR>it could have walked across the back of the house<BR>and garage and come around the corner within that<BR>time frame.  My wife described the eyes as very<BR>close together and a glowing green color and <BR>larger than a humans eyes.  My son described the<BR>creature as being very dark in color, with the<BR>hair very long and hanging down over its face,<BR>he couldn''t make out any facial features.  Our<BR>deck/porch is some 4 feet raised off the ground<BR>with the garage on the ground, based on my sons<BR>description of the height of the head in relation<BR>to the basketball hoop that was on the front of the garage, the thing was in the 7-8 feet tall<BR>range.  The next day I went out looking for any<BR>signs, I found nothing at the window or behind<BR>the house and garage area at the corner, I walked<BR>across a grass field that extends out from the side of the garage and did find what appeared to <BR>be a faint impression of a very large foot in a<BR>hard clay/sand non grassy spot.  I measured and<BR>copied the imprint the best I could, I have it<BR>somewhere in a notebook, but do remember it being<BR>some 16 inches in length and some 10-12 inches<BR>in width across the top, the impression was made<BR>along the weight bearing area''s with a large arch<BR>area that left no impression, the toes appeared <BR>to be small with all leaving the same type of<BR>impression.  This sighting occured in late<BR>December, around l0pm at night, and I feel that<BR>the year was l997 or l998.  <BR><BR>I also, a year or so before this sighting, being<BR>on the rear deck porch off our master bedroom,<BR>also later at night, hear a strange howling sound<BR>far off in the distance, sounding like it was <BR>near the top of the ridge some l/4 mile up the<BR>hill behind our house.

While counting the deer, I saw what looked like a bigfoot near one of the deer. It must have known I saw it because it started running away towards the treeline.

I knew he was still there down in the hollow where I was raised as a child. When we would cut firewood in the saw mill he would make us feel weird like he didn''t want us there. My mom would say start the truck and don''t stop until we get to the top of the ridge. We found footprints one winter that were very wide at the heel and very large in size like 17-20 inches long.

    " This took place while on the last day of firearm deer season in Novemeber, 1988.  It was after sunset but not yet dark.  The temperature was in the mid 30''s but the ground wasn''t frozen and there were still patches of snow on the ground in places.  I came out of the woods, put my shotgun, heavy winter coat, and daypack in the trunk of my car and got inside my car to start it up when a movement to my left caught my eye. I will tell you what I saw and what I thought as I was seeing this happen.  This man/bigfoot came out of thick brush between the trees to my left on the opposite side of the road from where I was parked, maybe thirty five or forty yards down the road at an angle but it had to know that I was there or at least that my car was there. When I first saw this thing coming out of the thick brush the first thing I thought was, where in the heck did he come from....  Then, I thought, stupid guy, no hunter orange and then I began to notice strange things like he had no gun, and that he was the same color from head to toe, no hat, no hunter orange?  But then what I really noticed was that his arms were long, his hands were swinging at his knees and though he was taking large steps crossing the road very quickly but without running, he was just walking.  His arms were swinging wide like a British soldier marching but he didn''t seem to be in any hurry and he completely ignored me like I wasn''t there but he had to know that I was there.  He did not look over and kept his head looking straight ahead. He went into the woods on my side of the road (side I was parked on) and went down the hill and disappeared.  My eyes told me that I just saw a bigfoot but my brain and common sense was trying to dispute that.  His color was dark brown and I thought could that have been a man in a one piece Carhartt outfit or if he were a hiker lost wouldn''t he just have stayed on the road rather than go down a steep hill when it was almost dark or if lost why didn''t he ask me for help?  He was about six feet tall but very husky with his hands, body, feet, side of his head-face, all one color.  I actually couldn''t see fur because the light was dim.  I could see the trees and tree trunks fine but not the bark because the tree trunks were silhoutetted and that''s what I mean about not seeing the fur, it was all one shade of dark brown.  Now, all of this that I just told you took place in a minute or less.  Soon as it disappeared over the side of the hill I jumped out of my car, opened the trunk and loaded my shotgun (for self-defense only), put on my winter coat, and got my flashlight out of my day pack and walked to where I thought the thing went over the hill.  I wanted to check out what I just saw and was hoping to find a footprint in the ground or on a patch of snow and I went slowly back and forth, traversing this rather steep hill going a little deeper down as I moved back and forth.  There was a deep like gorge on the right side of the hill and I looked up towards the road and by now the ridge on top was just a slither of gray and looking over my shoulder I realized this was not too smart, it was pitch black below me and I got a little scared and hiked back up to the road and to my car as fast as I could.  I placed my shotgun back in the case along with my heavy coat putting them in the truck and then I drove up and down the main forest road to see if there were any cars parked off on the sides or if there were anyone walking, I saw nothing.  I drove to the valley road where I thought this thing would eventually come out at the bottom of the hill into farm fields and I drove back to the end of this valley and back hoping to see something but saw nothing.  I have been wanting to make a report of what I saw and have told my wife, children, teenage granddaughters, brother, and two close hunting buddies, but have always been hesitant to make a report.  The truth is, though I am sure what I saw wasn''t a man I can''t prove it wasn''t a man dressed up in a suit but who would be that stupid especially during hunting season. I can''t say positively that it was a bigfoot but that is what my eyes saw.  Logic says \"no\", my eyes say, \"yes\" and that''s my report the best that I can remember it.  I am glad to get this off my chest.  If this helps in any way then that''s great but please use only my first name if this is posted, <BR>I am not seeking notoriety here, thanks.

    " It was the morning of the New Year in 1979 during the pre-dawn hours.  I took my wife with me to help search out a deer I thought I may have wounded while hunting the prior evening.  There was plenty of snow in the Tuttle marsh that year so we were able to see even though it was 6:00 a.m. approximately.  A storm had been predicted for New Year''s day and I knew if I was to have any chance of retrieving my deer, I would have to be out there early.<BR><BR>We were about a half a mile off old U.S. 23 and the heavy snows that year meant leaving the car parked on the highway.  When we got to my ground blind I positioned us exactly as I had been the previous evening to get some bearings as to when to begin our search.<BR><BR>It was already beginning to snow and as we peered through the blind we could see a tall dark image moving towards us.  We simply froze in the blind and watched.  It was a two-legged, ape-like creature about 7-8 ft. tall with a heavy coat of fur.  Had it not been for the size, I would have dismissed the sighting for a local hunter who I had encountered a number of times who always wore a three quarter length heavy fur coat. This man stood as tall as me at 6 ft., however, when this creature walked past and I saw it''s head brushing the tops of the tree limbs which were about two feet over my head, I had a pretty good idea of its size.<BR><BR>My wife and I never said a word, but after about ten minutes she whispered, \"Let''s get out of here!\"  We made one of the quickest exits imaginable through heavy snow over a half mile distance<BR><BR>The only people I have ever relayed this story to have been family members who had a good laugh.  However, the following week or so the Oscoda newspaper had an article regarding Big Foot sightings in the area where we had been, and my aunt who delivered mail in Oscoda sent us a clipping.

    " My Grandson (11 years old at the time) and I were hunting for deer in the back end of the Clay Bank swamp, this time on the north end of it, opposite of my earlier encounter, when it was getting twilight we decided to call it a day, picked up our equipment and started a slow walk back to my truck, only got about 50 yds when a 6 point buck ran within 20 feet to the front of us, and about 6 feet behind the deer was a sasquatch chasing him, it had its arms outstretched to grab the deer, it was black and in the 8 ft area, really big.  As the creature was directly in front of us it looked at us, it was as surprised as we were, the deer continued on to the south west, the creature headed south east at that point into the pines, hard woods, hemlock and ceders, it was out of sight in about 15 seconds, they seem to be able to hide from sight pretty easy.  My Grandson turned to me and said,\"Holy crap Grandpa did you see that big black thing?\" all I could say was \"yup\",  and again the safety was taken off on my rifle as we walked the rest of the way out.  My Grandson wanted to take a peek and see if we could see it again, but we didn''t.  To the east south east of us is a clear cut field which is the direction it headed in, and to the east of us is a jackpine plantation.  I feel the creature only went as far as it needed to be out of our sight, and probably to continue his hunt for venison after we were gone.  We were back in the same spot the next morning at my Grandson''s request, he was unafraid when he was with me, and against my better judgement we went back to same spot.",

    "Approximately 15 years ago, the witness''s son and his cousin frequently rowed their small boat across Bass Lake to the Cyr Swamp area near the old Cyr Mine location. Both boys mentioned several times that trees in the vicinity of the Cyr Mine area where they periodically adventured into had large branches broken off about ten to twelve feet above the ground. According to the witness, the boys often wondered how so many large branches could have been broken off so high above the ground, over such an extended period of time. In addition, both boys noted that the large branches were broken off during the summer and fall months - when there was no snow and ice to cause the limb damage.",

    " April 2,2008 I was attempting to get back to my home in the woods; we had had a very heavy wet snowfall -- blizzard like conditions== the night before which prevented me from driving home that night.  The following morning was very sunny and just above freezing.  As I attempted to drive down my two-track road my 4WD SUV became stuck in the wet, deep snow.<BR><BR>The snow came nearly to my knees making walking difficult.  As I turned up my road I noticed foot prints leading down my road, at which time I attempted to follow in the tracks.  Needless to say I was amazed at how large these prints were and the distance between each print. . . the prints were approximately 15 inches long and 8 inches wide with a stride of approximately 4 feet.  These prints were prestine in nature and straight covering 100-150 feet.<BR><BR>Being a very skeptical person about \"Big Foot\", I have absolutely no idea what else to think. I now am rethinking my original doubt. ",

    " When I was stationed in the U.P.of Michigan''s K.I Sawyer air force base,I travelled sometimes to see my family in the Detroit area.This was 1977-1978.A friend and I were driving on M-28,east of Munising.They may call it the Seney Stretch area.This was after an afternoon shift,so leaving the Marquette area at midnight or so would put us in the sighting area at around 1:30 am.This was winter time and quite cold.as we were driving,we both were looking down the road straight ahead.A mile or so up the road was a slight knoll or small hill and we could see the glow of headlamps from the other side highlighting the top of the knoll.Between us and the headlamp glow,we observed what we first thought was a bear crossing the road.It was at least 1/2 a mile up the road,but the headlamp glow from the other side of the hill outlined this thing quite clearly.It walked sort of hunched over until it reached the center of the road and then it stood upright and we could make out broad,manlike shoulders and arms.Bear shoulders are tapered downwards.These were broad.It then shlouched over a little and crossed the road.We just looked at each other with our jaws open.We slowed down near the area.It was cold,there were no houses or lights in the area and there was no reason for a man to be in this area in that weather at that time of night with not a house in sight.I don''t remember if there was a bright moon or not,but we looked for tracks.We didn''t look for long due th the temprature and the unknown in the middle of nowhere.<BR>I have mentioned this to people over the years and always wondered what it was that I saw.I never thought there may be interest in this subject in that area.",

I mean it had a head, shoulders, arms and legs, chest. It saw me at a distance of about three hundred feet and when it saw me it kind of hunkered down. I have seen deer do the same sort of thing when they are preparing to take flight. After hunkering down, it made a 90 degree turn and leaped and bounded through the air. Both feet were off the ground. It made another 90 degree left turn and disappeared among the trees. I could see the blackness disappearing behind and among the trees as it left. The total viewing time was no more than 3 seconds. It left in a big hurry. It was tall, about 6 feet or a little taller, black, slim and quick. I mean it was quicker than a deer.

    " I was driving home from work a year ago, December. It was about midnight. I was driving on hwy 138 heading east about 15 miles out of Roseburg, Oregon. As I rounded a curve in the road, I saw what I thought was a deer way up ahead crossing the road. I slowed down a bit as I got to where I thought the deer would be. What I saw was a figure standing just off the road by a fence with one hand on the fencepost and it turned as I went by, watching me. I thought It was a man so I stopped to see if he needed help. I got out of my truck with my flashlight in hand and started walking back toward the \"man\". I was working the lightbeam along the fenceline when I heard the most godawful sound I''ve ever heard in my life! I froze. I was in the military and I work as a psychiatric nurse and I don''t scare easily but that scream scared the crap out of me. It sounded like a dying calf in a hail storm..It was ranging in tone, starting out high pitched, then ending up as a threatening, low pitched, guttural sound. I dropped my flashlight and RAN back to my truck and spun tires getting out of there. The next day on my way to work, I stopped at the same spot. My flashlight was still there. I didn''t notice any footprints but did see the tall grass had been walked through on the other side of the fence. I looked on all the fence posts in the area where I saw it but did not see any evidence of hair. As to what it looked like, I only got a brief look as I went by, but it had to be at least 7 foot tall. I base this on the fact that I drive a Dodge Ram truck; when I''m sitting in the driver''s seat, my head is 6 feet off the ground. The spot where this thing stood is in a depression in the ground. When I park my truck in that spot and stand where it stood, I can''t see into the cab at all. And yet, that night I saw it, its head was even with mine, I was looking directly out the window not slightly up or down. I couldn''t make out features as it was dark but the lights of my pickup slightly illuminated the area where it stood as I went by. As I said, I thought it was a man at first who needed help. It looked so human at that moment, it wasn''t until later that I came to believe it couldn''t have been a man. No man could have made that sound. What I remember seeing was a figure standing next to the fence. Its head followed me as I went by. It didn''t appear to have shoulders, it looked like the head just spread out until it became shoulders. It appeared to have long hair all over; at first I thought it was a long jacket like a duster, but as I look back it had to be fur. But it was the scream that stands out in my mind. It was like a warning, \"don''t come closer\", at least that was the message I got!",

There  was nothing to abstruct my view because what was in back of him was shoulder and the road that continued West which also went up to a hill I only saw it because I crested over the hill it was plain as day what it was until he disappeared into the woods.

The two were walking into the woods off a trail near our home and saw a huge beige gorilla like creature.  The minute they saw it they were so scared they ran home.  Our daughter said there was no way this was a costumed person or another animal.  It was a tall two legged creature covered with beige colored hair. The two girls reported this incident to me almost immediately after it happened.  There was snow on the ground and they were wearing boots.  <BR><BR>I wanted them to show me the clearing where the creature was standing so I could look for footprints.  They said they would not go back there, they were too frightened.  On the way to tell me they saw another neighbor in her yard and told her but she did not believe them.

A few months ago, I saw something that just wasn''t right.   No crew in the van because I''d been called to the coal mine to move one crew from a train to another train at the mine.<BR><BR>On the way out there, it''s a long lonely road at night.   I dropped down over the Decker hill and something was walking along the right hand side of the road.   There''s always Indians, \"Native Americans\" walking out that road looking to get a ride.   That''s what I thought I saw.   But it walked across the road in front of me.   I had to hit the binders hard.   It wouldn''t look at me.   Just stood on the left shoulder of the road.   It did kind of look over it''s shoulder at me but I didn''t get any facial features.   It swayed when it turned.     <BR><BR>I did notice that it had long hair, almost like it was groomed. Probably 8-10 inches long.   Couldn''t tell you what color it was because it was almost midnight and it was in the headlights. <BR><BR>The next day, I had to make a daylight run.   I stopped and measured bushes, fence, and such.   This thing was at least 8 feet tall.  I looked for hair on the barbed wire, or tracks.   Nothing.<BR><BR>This happened in the old town of Decker Montana.   Decker was moved with the coal strike.   I remember where the old town was.  When you are driving North, you drop over a hill and the town was on the left.   My mother in law used to have the restaurant.   But it''s gone now.   However, this is where I encountered him/her when I dropped over the hill.<BR><BR>I did see deer before and after the sighting.

    " I have been walking my dog through Harris Forest Preserve for about 5 weeks now. About the last 3 days we have been walking back there I noticed a foul smell and starge howling noises. I didn''t think much of it at the because I''ve heard alot of coyotes howling in the area. I should also add my dog seemed pretty stressed out and affraid the last couple walks we were on. The last walk we went on was kind of late, from 6 till about 7 pm after dark. We heard quite a few knocks on trees that seemed pretty close by and rocks were being thrown at me and my dog. At first I thought it was some kids screwing around, until I got through the trail to the pond in back. I was paralysed with fear after what happened next. I believe it was a Bigfoot that ran out about 10 feet in front of me and stopped for about 15 seconds, it let out a very loud scream right at me then turned around and ran straight through the pond. I also noticed that behind me appeared to be another very large figure that ran the opposite direction. The first one I got a very clear view of, I was 8 to 9 feet tall with very wide shoulders about twice as wide as mine, it had dark brown hair mixed with some grey, and it smelled awful. I did not get a very good look at the other one but it did appear to be 8 to 10 feet tall. I have never really been a believer and as a matter of fact I am the kind of person more likely to make fun of a believer. That being said I am having a hard time coming up with an explanation for this. This happen in early Janurary and it was about 35 degrees out and I don''t think a person playing a joke would be able to handle the water temps.<BR><BR><img src=\"http://investigators.bfro.net:270/media/32616.jpg\"><BR>[ The small pond in Harris Forest Preserve where the witness had his encounter]",

    " It was Xmas eve 12/24/1980 app. 7:00pm. It was very very cold. I had just turned onto IL. R.R. 4  4 heading north and was picking up speed when I saw something in the middle of the road. There was no other cars in the area so i turned my bright lites on and started hitting my brakes. As I got closer i saw a bigfoot just standing in the middle of the road looking at me as if it was blinded by my headlights. I came to almost a complete stop as I looked at it and moved the car into the opposite lane to avoid hitting it. I came within inches of it and was looking at it the whole time. It was standing up but seemed to be kind of bent over at the waist and its was holding its right arm up against its chest (like if you would have your arm in a sling). I estimate it was well over 7 foot tall-(at the time i had a brother 6''8\" and I know it was much taller than he was). I keep saying it because I''m not sure of its sex. I was in amazement and not sure what to do. I decided to go to the next road and turn around but it was gone when I returned (app.1-1/2 -2 minutes later). The best I can remember the temp. Was around 0-fr. Or below. This is a very rural area and there is no reason anyone would be standing in the middle of the road on Xmas eve in that kind of weather dressed up like a bigfoot - esp. Who''s that tall to begin with? I am a hunter and have spent many hours in the wood but, have never seen anything like that before or after. ",

I saw a very large black thing it was bent down looking at something in the snow only 6ft from my window. Street lights were on and also the snow made things lighter. I froze and started crying and begged my friend to look and she was afraid because I was saying some kind of monster was out their, anyway it looked up at me and slowly stood up and took one step toward me and I ran in my brothers room and jumped on his bed begging him to help. He was afraid too so we hid in his closet until my friend''s mother was knocking at the door she was mad she didn''t come home. No one believed me.

I watched it watch us drive away in my rearview for about a minute then it ran away on it''s legs just like a human.

    " I know this is a years-old report, but..<BR><BR>I''ve only told 3 people about this, EVER.  If I hadn''t just read that another sighting occurred near the same area previously, I still wouldn''t say anything.<BR><BR>It was a very cold 3:00am sighting on the NW edge of Decatur, Il.  The moon was full enough to make our whole back yard visible.  I was standing in the dark at our second story window looking (south) out at the back yard, partly because I am an insomniac, but this time because our 3 Beagles at the bottom of the hill were all barking in a way I''d never heard.<BR><BR>From the SW corner of the house walked a very large ''thing'' covered in either a lighter greyish or beige fur, moving diagonally SE in front of me toward where our dogs were.  My first thought (because my mind couldn''t wrap around anything else) was that it was our neighbor looking for his horse again, but this ''thing'' was ALL fur, huge, muscular.  As I stood there, fixed, it suddenly stopped and turned a little sideways and looked straight up into my eyes...like it knew I was there.  We stared at each other for almost a full minute.<BR>I was frozen, but knew I was witnessing something truly wonderful, that I''d made a connection to a wondrous creature, and was in awe.  I could see perfectly its facial features, more human than ape, no fur on it, and sensed from the expression that it was a curiosity there, not an aggressiveness.<BR><BR>Then awe suddenly turned to fear that it was going to harm our dogs, as it turned back, in no hurry, but a deliberate ''going on about his business and direction''.  It had to duck UNDER some apple tree branches and continued on down the hill where I lost sight of him, but our dogs suddenly stopped barking and everything was still. I had no idea if he''d killed them or not.<BR><BR>My kids were asleep, my husband wasn''t the type to believe me...so I stayed at that window, praying, afraid to go outside, for over an hour...stayed up all night checking.  No further sighting.<BR><BR>When it got light I went out and checked.  Dogs were all fine.  They must''ve just gotten so scared when they saw him that they froze, too.  I don''t know.  What I do know is that my husband is 6''2\" and when I asked him later that day to reach up to try and touch that branch that my ''creature'' had to duck to avoid, he couldn''t reach it and it was about a foot higher than his extended arm.  I''ll let YOU do the math on the height.<BR><BR>I found no fur/hair on any branch or the dog run fencing.  I looked.  No footprints because the ground was frozen.  If I''d had one ounce of proof, I''d have turned it in or called somebody.  All I have is a memory forever burned into my brain like it happened yesterday, and feel so privileged that I was allowed to witness this.  I don''t need anyone to ever prove beyond a doubt that they exist.  I KNOW THEY DO!     <BR>",

    " I attended two BFRO Expeditions last year, the Oklahoma trip in September and the Missouri Ozarks trip in November. After those trips I wanted to try to locate some sasquatches in my area. There is a national forest close by where I live, and we''ve been hiking & camping there my whole life. But we never thought about sasquatches possibly being in there. Since those expeditions we of course began to think about that. Me & my Dad have been scouting out this one area for a while now, with Harold Benny (BFRO Investigator) and on our own a few times. It is heavily wooded and has lots of ridges & valleys, and plenty of water sources too. Tons of deer. Just seemed like an ideal spot.<BR><BR>This was only our second time there at night. We went up the trail into some pines and built a fire and cooked some bacon and just talked. We stayed there for about 2 hours, and did two knocks. We weren''t hearing anything, and the wind started to pick up....we were on a big hill. So we decided to pack up and head back down the trail, maybe try another spot or just go on home. We both had to work the next day. <BR><BR>By now it was dark, with a cloudy sky and some stars, so we had our headlamps on. Mine was green and his was red. About halfway down we stopped in the pines and he did three whoops just to see what would happen. As soon as we came off the hill it became still, so we could hear much better. We didn''t hear anything after the whoops except coyotes. I thought I heard a long whoop kind of start off the coyote chorus but I wasn''t sure. So we kept heading down the trail.<BR><BR>I was leading the way, and we were about 80 ft from the trailhead/parking lot. My truck''s headlights were reflecting in my light. I was not expecting to see or hear anything, and just focused on watching where I was walking. Then Dad whispered, \"Rachel, come back here....there he is\". He had stopped and was looking into the trees to our left. I turned around and went back to him. I actually thought he was talking about a coyote because we''d seen a bunch in that same spot going in. I looked to where he was looking and saw EYES. Big round eyes. They were shining white-ish green. Then Dad whispers, \"Turn your light off\", and before I did we saw the head turn, he looked ahead then looked back at us. We both had our lights on him, and we could actually see the outline of his head when he turned. It was rounded like a persons, and I could see how the eyes were positioned on the front of the face. That''s when it registered for me that it was in fact a sasquatch. This is all happening in a few seconds. <BR><BR>As we flipped our lights off, he started to walk. I believe I took a step back and said \"Whoa\" because he was close.  He was about 30-40 feet from us. He took some big heavy deliberate steps, about 6 or 7, moving down the hill. Then he stopped. Dad said, \"Should I whoop at him...?\" I said NO!! I really didn''t want to spook/annoy/provoke him! He didn''t seem very afraid of us though, or especially bothered by our shining lights in his face. So we just stood there for a couple of minutes and I talked to him softly, and whistled. As soon as I started talking he moved, then was still again. <BR><BR>My heart was just pounding. I could not believe it. It felt like he was waiting to see what we were going to do. So we left quietly. <BR><BR>What surprised me was how close we were to the trail head parking lot, and also that he was right there and not making a sound! If my Dad hadn''t looked around at that moment we never <BR>would have known he was there. They are so stealthy & smart. I do think he might have been on his way up to check us out. The wind was blowing his way, so I''m sure he smelled the bacon. <BR><BR>I shined my light over the truck when we got home, and it had marks on it, that we are positive were not there earlier in the day. I took pictures. They look like finger swipes in the dust. I can''t say for certain what made them, but they are weird. <BR><BR>We are both very excited! This was our first definite bigfoot experience in our own state.",

Small trees breaking and leaves crunching.<BR>I had no idea what it was, I had my back against the wide tree 16'' in the air, (the tree is wider than my back) and you cant see me or my stand from behind.<BR>It stopped right behind me, it is now dark, I could hear it breathing, it was 8 yards behind me, I didn''t move, it stood there for about 5 minutes then started sniffing the air like it was smelling for something, then it started to move slightly, it was dry out and leaves covered the ground so you can hear anything move. <BR>Then 2 loud tree knocks, I then started to get a chill down my back, as I reached for my bow I heard 2 screams, I had my bow in hand and my shooting trigger was on my bow string and I WAS AT FULL BRAW. The screams vibrated the woods.<BR>It stood there pacing behind my tree, left to right then stopped to smell the air again, it started to move West at a regular walk/pace.<BR>I let off my bow, reached around the tree, clicked on my head lamp and about 12 yards from me was a 8'' tall 700/800lb tall black figure, it grunted when my light came on and ran along the river bank and back into the woods.<BR>I did not see a face, I saw the back of IT.<BR>I will say this, It was hunting that night, it was smelling for scent and chasing deer, looking for food. <BR>At the time my bow was loaded with a 1.5\" expandable broad/arrow head, Yes I was at full draw not knowing what was going on, when my light was on and I drew my bow back again I was ready to shoot if it came back across the stream. I know the exact yards as I have hunted this location for around 5 years, I bow hunt so I need to know the yards for arrow placement. This Sasquatch which what it was, was a massive animal. I don''t know if it would harm anyone or persons but the power that I could see it its body was unbelievable. Yes I was scared but I saw something that only a few people in the world have seen.  ",

The friend''s version of the story is more or less consistent with the story told by the witness, so it will remain accessible here.]<BR><BR>I worked at plant that produces feed grade Amino Acid additives.

As a shift worker, we work 2 weeks on the day shift, then switch to 2 weeks nights...it''s hell on the body''s sleep cycle.  <BR><BR>Anyway, in November of 2000, a fire started in the new plant and as a result, some of the new hires were assigned to work with us in the old plant while their facility was being repaired.  One night, we were sitting in the lunchroom, around midnight, grabbing a bite to eat.  I made the remark about a \"less than helpful\" co-worker to the tune of, \"he''s like Bigfoot, occasionally there''s a sighting\", eluding to the fact that this particular co-worker had a tendency to hide on midnights and leave all the work to the rest of us.  We all laughed, but one of the new guys got real quiet and his eyes got real big and serious...then he said, in the most serious tone...that sh@% is for real!  We all got very quiet and as we calmed to listen, he told his story.  <BR><BR>Now this is a guy who was well-liked because he was such a \"crack-up\" which is what you need to have in the manufacturing sector.  He went on to tell the story of how he encountered a Bigfoot when he was on a date in Chafee, Missouri.  <BR><BR>Him and his girlfriend were parked on a narrow dirt road, just off a county road near Scott City, Missouri.  They were doing what young folks do in a car on friday nights, and when they were ready to leave, they started the car and turned on the headlights.  About 20 yards ahead, they saw a creature, frozen, looking back at them with yellow eyes.  They couldn''t turn around due to the narrow lane, so he put it in reverse and backed out about 100 feet to the road and made haste into town.  He said they were so scared, they believed the creature might be on top of their car, that they drove to a convenience store where a group of people were gathered, in the hopes that if people started to scatter, they were correct in their assumption that a Bigfoot was on top of their car.  <BR><BR>We all sort of laughed at his story, but he remained serious...and I''ve got to tell you, this seemed strange, because he is normally a very funny guy and his face was quite sullen as he told his story.<BR>I sort of believed him and inquired from some of the others as to what they thought.  <BR><BR>Some say there is a creature in Southeast Missouri known as Yehoo man, so it''s not a new phenomenom.  I''ve been waiting seven years now and noone in this area has posted any reports of sightings here.  I check this site every once in a while and decided to finally tell this story because I believe the young man saw a Bigfoot and I even had him take me out to the location.  <BR><BR>It happens to be close to a residence, although out in the country, and located close to a stream with trees on both sides of the lane he claimed to be parked in.  It''s just another one of those accounts that will probably add to the mystery of what I believe is the last frontier of animal science.  ",

    " I am a Missouri resident. Back in 91 or 92 (can''t remember which year) I was coming home and coming around a curve when I noticed eyeshine. As I got closer I could see a creature standing on the side of the road, reddish-brown color, at least 8 ft. tall and massive. As the truck lights hit this thing it threw up it''s arm and covered it''s face. It was not a man in a suit or a bear. When I say massive I mean massive. This thing was anywhere between 600/800 lbs.  <BR><BR>As the years went by I moved but within 7 miles from where I saw this creature the first time. I have been here 19 years now. Back in the first years I would come home at night and hear things that I have never heard before, not thinking it was Bigfoot, just not knowing what I was hearing until one night about 2:30am   I let my little dog out and heard a holler that was long and to me sounded like a warning. I swooped my little dog up ran in house and shook! <BR><BR>We have 119 acres, mostly wooded. My mother moved a trailer onto my land and was here about 7 years before she passed away in 2010.  She would call me and tell me something is hitting her door/trailer at night very hard. She also was throwing rocks out of yard to keep lawn mower from getting them and to her surprise two rocks came right back at her over her head. She never seen what threw them though. That also happened to me when I would be weed-eating her yard. <BR><BR> One time she heard a pack of dogs running and barking. She went out to look and she said all of the sudden something firmly started \"talking\" in animal language to these dogs and then she never heard the dogs again. She stated that if an 800 lb gorilla could talk, that''s what it would sound like. <BR><BR>Around the time she started telling me things were hitting the trailer at night and she was hearing walking around outside. Then it started here at my house. Rocks hitting on house, rocks thrown on top of the house. It came up onto my porch. I heard it scuffle and run off as I was laying in bed. I knew whatever was just on my porch was extremely heavy! I have never been so petrified in all my life. Then the wood knocks the very next night. <BR><BR>My husband worked nights so it was just my daughter and I at home. After my husband retired he was working on my truck at our bottom barn and as he pulled down there he saw something he said was not a man or a bear, but it ran so fast that he didn''t know what it was. He said it was big and fast. After that he started finding footprints. He would come and get me and show them to me.  <BR><BR>I heard this thing holler on several occasions holler, wood knocking and walking around outside. So much has happened throughout the years here, really way too much to document. I have noticed that it comes around if you sing. <BR><BR>At the end of last summer I bought a cheap little night vision scope. One night i asked my husband \"You want to go sit out on the front porch with me? He said OK, so we went out and I took the night vision scope.  I turned it on, started focusing it in, and to my amazement there it was in the woods in the darkness 50 yards in front of the house. <BR><BR>As I was looking at this thing I said,\"OH MY GOD HENRY IT''S BIGFOOT!!! I''m sure he was thinking \"Yeah right.\" But I handed him the night vision scope, pointed and said it''s standing right there. I waited a minute and asked,\"Do you see it?\" He said \"Yes I see it!\" I said,\"I told you there was a Bigfoot, and it was out here!!\" <BR><BR>This thing was standing there watching us as we were watching it. It was approx. 8 feet. or taller, and huge. It''s arms hung down past it''s knees and kind of curved as like a monkeys would. It''s head was crowned to some degree. We passed the scope back and forth to each other. My husband couldn''t believe what he was seeing. I watched it crouch down and stand right back up. While we were watching that one, something other than it threw a rock on carport. My big brave husband wanted to walk out to it. I told him it could rip him apart with little effort if it felt threatened. My husband started to walk out to it. There was a sudden flash of movement in the scope and then it was gone. I couldn''t see it any more so I hollered out, \"I don''t see it any more. You better not go out there!\" But it was gone. <BR><BR>It has never hurt or threatened us (besides growling at me). In total I saw this creature 4 times and only 1 is questionable. If I didn''t see with my own two eyes I would be skeptical too I suppose. <BR><BR>Before I end my report here, my husband informed me as he was walking the dog this morning he heard a wood knock in one direction and a whistle in another. I heard the whistles the other night when i went out to see what the dog was raising cain about.",

    " I am not sure of the date. My daughter was 1-2 years old, so it would have had to have been in 1988 or 1989.<BR><BR>We were going from Crocker, MO. to Waynesville/St. Robert, MO. to Wal-Mart.  We crossed the Waynesville/Crocker bridge on Hwy. 17 (North of Waynesville, South of Crocker) and were almost out of the \"Waynesville Corners\" --this highway has several corners and curves after the bridge because it has a bluff on one side and the Roubidoux Creek/Gasconade River on the other.  When we were almost through the corners and coming up on the \"40 MPH Speed Limit Sign\" which means that we are getting close to entering the Waynesville,  MO. city limits.  It was a winter night, about 7:00 pm and had been dark for about 2 hours .  We rounded a corner and were meeting a car--both of us had our headlights on -- and there in the middle of the road--standing right on the yellow line which separates the two lanes--is this \"thing.\"  It was about 7-8 feet tall and covered with hair.  It was almost \"frozen,\" much like a deer is when the headlights of a car hit it.  My husband was driving and he slammed on the breaks, as did the car that we had met.  At this time, we were just passed the creature, as was the other car.  But, both of us had stopped--and there standing on the yellow line of Hwy.17, and being illuminated by the tail lights of both vehicles--still stood this creature.  It stood there for about 30 seconds and then it sort of leaped off the roadway and into the Roubidoux Creek/Gasconade River.  At this time, I was extremely scared and was pleading with my husband to just \"GO!\"--so we took back off, as did the other car.  We continued on toward Waynesville and the other car continued on toward Crocker.  We did not get out to  investigate, and as far as I know, the other car didn''t either. We had no weapons with us (just in case we would need them) and it was dark--and suddenly very eerie.  I have never heard of any  stories of this particular incident, so I assume that the other people who witnessed this had the same idea that we did--NEVER TELL A SOUL--we have discussed this with close friends and family,  but no one else--until now.  When I visited this web site and found out that there were acutally other sightings in the state of Missouri, I thought maybe there was some worth to telling about this night. (I forgot to add that it was drizzling that evening).",
    :environment
    "Very hilly terrain. There is a steep bluff on one side of the highway--impossible to climb up or down because it was cut to make the roadway. The bluff does have at least one fairly large cave within 1/2 mile of the sighting--several other caves in the area. On the other side of the highway is the Roubidoux Creek. Just passed the sighting area, the Roubidoux Creek (a very large creek that is prone to flooding) meets the Gasconade River. On the other side of the creek is mainly farmer''s land--fields and such. About 1/4 - 1/2 mile beyond the creek is another very large bluff with several caves. On the other side of the bluff that is next to the highway is miles and miles of woods, bluffs, valleys, gravel roads, and caves. (Pulaski County is the third largest county for caves in the state of Missouri and this happens to be an area that has a vast number of caves and caverns).",

    " I was just a kid when I saw it.  I was sitting in the back of an old Chevy Citation at the time it was pretty new, my uncle was driving and my aunt was in the passenger seat and my little cousin who was around 4 or 5 at the time was sitting in the back with me, were coming home and I believe from visiting family or something.  My aunt & uncle lived down this old dirt road around 2 miles and right before their driveway which was on the left was and old dry branch or creek that ran across the road and it did not have a concrete slab to cross over it so you had to slow down a little to cross.  Directly to the right of the creek was an old driveway leading to an old abandoned house which no one had lived in for years.  It was dark so naturally we had the headlights on and as my uncle began slowing to pass over the rough gravel something in the corner of my right eye came into view.  My aunt kind of screamed but not loudly because we were amazed and terrified.  Something that looked to be around 8 foot tall, (I know as a 10-11 year old kid it was huge) came across the branch which led out of the old driveway and not running but walking briskly came directly in front the car.  We all just stared as it was some dream.  It was swinging it''s arms a little and acted like we were not even there.  It walked across the creek and crossed the water gate which I don''t remeber if it went under or over but what I do remeber is the branch had washed out the bank of my uncle''s yard and his perimter fence was quite tall if you were staning in the branch and this bright red haired thing jumped over from the bed of the branch like nothing and into my uncles yard.  Mind you were still watching in the car.  We could see it walk up thru the yard and up the hill until we lost sight of it with the headlights.  My uncle turned into the drive and we had all locked the doors.  My aunt and uncle went thru the count of 3 thing and we open the doors and ran inside.  We got inside and my uncle got his hunting rifle out and went outside with his flood lite and looked for it and on his way back which he didn''t walk far he tripped on the chord and it came unplugged then he yelled and got up and ran into the house and locked the door.  To this day if you ask him about what he saw he will say he saw something but he doesn''t know what it was or that somebody was playing a joke on us.  My aunt will tell that she saw bigfoot and so will I.  My little cousin was to small to remeber much but I remeber and to this day I don''t go out into the woods without a weapon.  To the best of my ability this is what it looked like.  It was around 7-8 foot tall, completly covered in red hair and 1 feature I remember is it looked like it''s arms were almost as long as it''s legs and that it was not afraid of us.  Also at that time there was a man I do not remember but lived in the area and was at the local store there in Souder, Mo. and was telling everyone he had seen bigfoot and no one believed him so none of us ever made much mention to it except to family or close friends.  But I believe. I know what I saw.",

I have been working a special project and my hours are from 3 PM to Midnight.  I was driving North on K-7 Highway just past Leavenworth Road near Falcon Estates Subdivision when a very large animal darted across the road in front of me running on two feet.  I did not slow down and was only able to see the back end of the animal.  The only thing in my mind right now is the fur pattern that I saw.  The fur looked a little longer than my hair which would make the hair about 2 to 3 inches and a little darker than color tan but a lighter color than the color brown, more of a dirty blond, it had waves in the hair, almost curly in areas.  It was larger and faster than any deer that I have ever seen in the area.  The size could be a large horse or elk.  I am glad that I did not hit it because of its size it would have totaled my car.  I cannot be 100% sure but it could have been a Big Foot.  The tail bone was about even to the middle of my drivers side window.  I drive a Ford Focus.  I was just amazed by the fur color and texture.  ",

    " I was looking around on the internet last night and ran onto to your site and it brought back a memory of something that happened to me when I was around 18 years old. The best I can recall was that it was around 1979. So I thought I would go ahead and report it just incase someone else has also reported this. I have told several people about this but most just think I''m crazy but I know what I saw.<BR><BR>It was a very cold winter morning (maybe December 1979 or January 1980), I lived on a farm. We had a long driveway and the mail box was at the end of the driverway. Just west of the mail box was a long shelterbelt with lots of trees. I went down to get the mail and pulled up to the mail box in my pickup when something caught my eye walking in the field so I pulled up to see better. What I saw was a large man like thing walking south in the field toward the sherlterbelt. It was approx. 1/4 mile west of me and approx. 10 to 20 yards north of the shelterbelt. I saw it for about 10 to 12 seconds is all. I remember it being dark brown with long hair. The wind was blowing fairly hard out of the north and I remember seeing the hair on it''s arms and face blowing toward the front of it because the wind was at it''s back. I also remember it having long arms and it took big steps. It kind of turned it''s head and looked a little toward me and then walked a little faster and disappeared in the trees. I know it wasn''t a man because no one would have been walking out there on such a cold morning. I had a high power rifle with a scope in my pickup but didn''t have time to even pick it up and look through the scope at it. I wanted to go out there and look for tracks but I was afraid to. There was snow on the gound maybe about a foot worth. This field was a paster that it was walking in. The shelterbelt consisted of large old cottonwood trees and some pine trees. Well that''s about it. ",

    " On 12/4/05, at approximately 8:15 a.m. I was standing approximately 50 yards from the south-west corner boundary marker of my property when I heard the neighbors dogs start to bark and run southward on Arkansas Highway 7. They only ran a short distance before stopping.  <BR><BR>I immediately thought that they must be barking at a deer that was crossing the road.  My first thought was to get my gun from my truck.  Then, I remembered that I had parked outside the fence in front of my house.  So, I decided to just stand there and see if it was a doe or buck and hope it would not feel pressured since the dogs had stopped barking.  I also believed the deer would change directions if it saw me hurrying in its same general direction.  Therefore, I just stood still and waited in hopes of getting a glimpse of it.  Then, if the dogs would keep quiet, I could hunt it later.  Only one got to see it for 2 to 3 seconds, but I saw it clearly.  <BR><BR>My first impression was that I was observing a very large man who was wearing a hooded black parka, then I realized it was some kind of animal.  It was approximately 50 yards away and was on the opposite side of an old fence that has been overtaken by grass, weeds, vines etc.<BR><BR>I only had a left side view as it was traveling east along an old fence row.  It covered a distance of about 20 yards in about 3 seconds.  I could only see its upper body.  I could see that it was not a bear but I couldn''t make out distinct facial features from the side from that distance.  It was like an ape in some ways but its posture appeared more man-like.  <BR><BR>I can best describe the size by comparing it to a very large man I know who is approximately 69 and weighs roughly 280 pounds.  This creature was least that tall, possible a little taller, but close to the same build.   <BR><BR>I did not get a long view of it. I probably would not have had time to take a picture even if I would have had a camera in my hand.  <BR><BR>It was moving at a brisk pace, but not lightening fast.  Its stride resembled a trot or a jog.  The body was moving quickly but there was no up and down motion. It appeared to have a moderately thick coat of black hair. From what I could tell its face was dark too, as if there was some hair on its face. <BR><BR>It was moving through a well used deer crossing. There is an old fence row there, on of both sides of Arkansas Highway 7.  The west fence row had recently been cleared and the east side was logged about five years ago and has a fair amount of undergrowth and a game trail running along the south side of the fence row.  <BR><BR>Just a little to the south west of the spot there is a thicket that is approximately 3 acres in size.  There are a couple partial open areas in the woods here. Most parts of this thicket can be walked through fairly easily. In places the thicket is too thick to move through without clippers and or a machete. <BR><BR>I did not see where the creature crossed Arkansas Highway 7 but it most likely came from an area that is about 40 yards away from the highways west side ride-of-way.  <BR><BR>I believe that this creature waited until there were no cars coming becoming before crossing the road.  I did not get the impression that it was running from something.  <BR><BR>I have mentally replayed the entire scenario many times and I have stood and looked at the same area where the creature was seen. I looked for tracks after the incident but the ground was too brushy for obvious tracks.<BR><BR>I''ve stood in the spot where I observed the creature from. I''ve watched as vehicles traveled north and along Arkansas Highway 7 and considered every other possible scenario. It wasn''t any kind of illusion. It was there and I saw it.<BR>",

    " Around 5pm I was driving down hwy 258 to go to the store. We have had some recent flooding so I was driving slower than normal and watching for deer. Along the way I seen 2 different area of deer, one had 3 I could see the other there was at least 6. So on the way back from the store I knew to slow down in those areas just in case. In one area it is a rather sharp curve and I had seen the most deer there. As I came up on the curve I slowed down and suddenly something jumped out in front of the car!!! I''ll call it a \"he from here out.\"  He seem to have been running from the pine tree line and took a, what I would call a leap, out onto the road then he was gone. It was only 1 maybe two steps on the road it''s self to clear it! I had slammed on the brakes and just sit there in awe wondering if I really seen what I had.  He was standing on two legs, lots of fur and what I would assume Is at least 8 foot tall. When he jumped in front of the car he was about a car length in front of me. He looked to have had a large fish in his hand. I know how that sounds but I swear it was a long fish. My husband said it may have been a stick but I''m a country girl and I know my fish! His \"fur\" was longer than what bear fur would be and although he was dark brown it had a reddish hue to it, the headlights gave s good look at the color as it leaped across.  There is a lake back behind where he was running from but he also jumped across to the right where those 6 plus deer were standing. <BR><BR>We are going back at first light to see if he left foot prints. It''s so muddy I''m hoping to see some.  We hear sounds out here almost nightly of what we describe as big foot sounds but I''ve honestly never thought they was out here. It is just sounds you can''t describe, so we call it bigfoot sounds. I''ve had several friends and family hear them and one of them will not stay outside long out here because she''s heard it so much.  <BR><BR>When I got home my husband came to the door to help bring stuff in and ask what was wrong, I said the deer are out bad and he asked if I hit one, I said no and he asked why was I shaking. <BR><BR>I didn''t realize my whole body was still shaking! LoL  I started telling him and I had tears rolling down, heart pounding and still shaking so bad. It really shook me up so much.  Not sure what else to say. It was one of the most amazing yet scariest things I''ve ever seen. I know I will not sleep tonight due to thinking about it and what exactly happened.",

    " I have always been reluctant to tell this story because I am still not sure to this day what I actually witnessed. One night, early 1988 in Greene County, Arkansas, just outside of Paragould, my girlfriend and I were \"parking\" behind a school gymnasium. We had visited this location on many previous occasions without any strange occurances. This particular night was cold, about 40 degrees, but clear and no moon. The only light was from a distant yard light on the school grounds. Off to our right front side was a tennis court with 4 foot high chain link fence along the sides and 10 foot high chain link fence on each end. As the night moved on, my girlfriend and I got the feeling that we were being watched. We were unable to see any movement outside the truck and we did not hear any sounds, just the strange feeling. It was around 11 pm and as we started to leave, I noticed a dark figure standing next to the 10 foot tall section of the chain link fence. What ever it was stood approximately 8 1/2 to 9 feet tall and we could see it swaying slightly from side to side. It was approximately 30 yards away. With only the dim, distant light, I could only make out that it was dark in color and I was unable to distinguish any facial features or hair length. A wooded tree line stood about 30 yards away from the creature. We were both scared and did not want to scare or anger this thing, so we sit quietly for about 10 minutes trying to guess what it was. Then it turned from us and slowly walked toward the woodline, turning it''s head to look back at us before disappering into the woods. We then left the area quickly. The next day, still scared, I returned in the daylight. I was unable to find any evidence that a creature was ever there.",

    " Winter, 1982:<BR>     On this occasion, there had been a big snowstorm, and nothing was moving on the streets.  There weren''t even any tire tracks.  I was about fifteen years old, and worked at a fast-food restaurant about a mile north of this location, and was forced to walk home because my father had called and told me that conditions were so bad he couldn''t get the car out of the drive.  The heavy blanket of snow made visibility good, reflecting light as it does.  As I cleared some trees to the east, I observed movement to my left through peripheral vision, and looked to my left into the ravine, and saw a figure apparently playing in the snow. <BR><BR>For an instant, I thought that it was a child wearing a dark colored snow suit, but as the moment passed, I became very aware that this was no child.  I had a very clear view of it, and could see that it was black, or very close to black, and covered with long hair or fur from head to toe.  It was probably around five feet tall, and weighed about 160lbs. The creature continued playing in the snow, bending over at the waist, and throwing snow up into the air with both hands in a wide scooping motion, throwing it up so that it came back down on its head.  It also began rolling in the snow.<BR><BR>I felt stark terror at the sight of the thing.  I was also very unnerved knowing that I was very far from any residential area, in the early morning, and that there was absolutely no traffic on the road. <BR><BR>The creature was only about thirty to thirty-five yards from me, and I had about an eighth of a mile to clear until I was out of sight of the creature.  I thought about running, but I feared that my footfall and rapid motion would catch the thing''s attention and that it would then begin chasing me as is instinctive for a lot of animals.<BR><BR>The point is, I had quite a bit of time to view this thing, and the longer I looked at it, the more I realized that what I was looking at did not fit any rational explanation.  Once I was out of sight, and I thought I was out of earshot, I ran as fast and as far as I could.<BR><BR>This area is now a park, Hafer Park, but at the time, nothing was there but a wooded area and the ravine, which is a drainage ditch.  Even now, with the park, there is still a good deal of wooded area there.<BR><BR>David A. Farris, author of \"Mysterious Oklahoma,\" says that locals have dubbed this creature the \"skunkape,\" reportedly because of its terrible odor.  I did not smell anything in this incident, but I have a very poor sense of smell and serious sinus and allergy problems which are routinely exasperated by the cold weather.   ",

    "Unknown primate type creature on all-fours passes in front of hunters north of Mannsville",
    :otherstories
    "I didn''t think much about it at the time but after reading several stories about wood knocks and dens, I realized that I may of alarmed one when I walked into it''s core area 20 years ago. I remember seeing brush piles in this area where there was no reason for them to be there. I didn''t think much of it at the time and then I began to hear what sounded like someone splitting or chopping wood. Just recently it dawned on me that the sound could have been wood knocks. After hearing the noise I saw a figure in the distance moving around up the hill. I was walking along the creek headed west. Later that evening I told my father that there was a squatter living on our ranch on a hillside south of the creek. The reason I say squatter was because the upright being that was moving around acted as if someone had come into it''s territory, our ranch was big enough to where my father would not of known if someone was living out there. We tried to ride on horseback through that area a week later to make sure but it was too thick. Anyway, just this year I realized that all the encounters (the primate crossing the road, the whoops and the tree knocks) happened within a mile of each other on a 24,000-acre ranch. We leased this pasture to the same family for over 30 years and even though we sold the ranch 8 years ago I find myself wanting to call this family to ask them if they ever saw or heard anything strange while deer hunting.",

    " In January of 2003 two friends and I were bobcat hunting in western Johnston County.  It was a cloudy day, which increased our chances of seeing some cats.  I enjoy hunting but was a little green behind the ears as far as hunting bobcats.  However, two of us were able to harvest our 1st cats at two different stands.  The other guy was not an experienced hunter and just enjoyed being out seeing some country he had never seen.  He and I were driving together with the other friend following us.  We crossed a cattle guard going into a heavily wooded pasture and we''re driving somewhat slowly.  Then out of the woods came something.  It was about 30 ft in front of us, and walking on all fours.  It was very muscular with a heavy coat of grey fur.  I was amazed and the definition of the back muscles.  After about three seconds I asked, \"What is that?\"  In a long drawn out reply he says \"I...don''t.... know?\"  I then said, \"Why won''t it look at us?\"  I never accelerated and just continued to creep down the road.  It was odd how the front appendages really didn''t support this creature.  It''s back legs kind of kicked out as it scurried across the road.  We were able to view him for probably 6-7 full seconds.  It''s hard to tell how tall this thing was because it stayed bent over as it walked (like a monkey).  From what I saw, it stayed at around 3 and half ft above the ground.  But its butt was never more than 6 inches off the ground as it walked.  Within seconds it vanished.  We both thought it looked and walked like a gorilla.  I said it has to be a large bobcat if anything.  And that''s what we kind of agreed upon for years.  Until recently I saw a close-up photo on Monster Quest of a creature in Florida that appeared like a gorilla.  Last month I called the friend and asked him what it was he thought we saw five years ago.  We agreed this thing looked to be about 150 to 175 lbs in weight and could no way be a bobcat.   I told him that in 1999 in that same area I did hear a scream one night about a half mile south of the sighting.  He asked why I never told him that story.  I guess I never linked the two occurrences till recently.  ",
    :environment
    "It was a pasture called the Hells hole. lots of cedar and brush however this was only about 50 yards from a rather large wheat field and was about 400 yards north of where we had just killed a bobcat so this creature would of heard the shots (we had to run it down and finish it off with a shotgun, it was rather disturbing to hear it squall like that).",

The tree was about 60 yards from her house and close to the road.  We drove down to the tree and I had my bright lights on and was about 50 ft away from the tree.  We saw something huge and white sitting on a branch of the tree.  I saw the head and shoulders.  The shoulders were broad and it didn''t look like it had a neck.  My friend saw two legs dangling down.  The legs were hairy and were moving.  The head and shoulders were moving slightly back and forth like it was getting ready to jump down.  My friend screamed and shouted \"go, go, go\".  I was in shock, but managed to put the car in reverse and backed out as fast as I could and drove off.

    " Hello,I drive a delivery truck to Kansas 3 times a week.On the day of this sighting I had taken my 12 year old son with me on my route.As we turned onto Highway 10 from Highway 75 I told him to watch for deer on his side of the truck and I''d watch on mine. This road has had several deer killed from vehicles and I didn''t want to hit one.As I drove we watched and seen no deer along the 6 miles stretch to Wann.As we rounded the curve on the east side of Wann it turns back into wheat fields, so we resumed watching for deer.As I started to watch on my side of the road I looked out across a winter wheat field (which is green this time of year)and noticed about 200-300 yards away a HUGE black figure bent over. I slowed the truck down to get a better look when my son turned to look at what I was looking at and he said,\"Dad,is that a Bigfoot?\"and about that time it stood upright and looked at the truck.I replied \"I think so.\"I would have to say it was about 7-8 feet tall and about 300-500 pounds with jet black hair and a cone shaped head and very well proportioned. As we watched it for about 2 minutes it just stood there and watched us while it ate something it was picking off of a small branch it held in its right hand. (berries perhaps)The wierd thing about it it never ran or walked away.As we drove on it turned its whole body to watch us drive off not just its head.

    " My wife and I were in Broken Bow, OK on Sun. the 18th of March 2012. We live in Arkansas about 20 miles west, but on a whim decided to take a 2 hr detour north on HWY 259 and cut across Rich Mt. Rich Mt is the highest point in the Ouachita Mts. I had commented about how squatchy the area looked and my wife replied that we would not see one in the day time. Well, about 45 minutes later she saw one. We were about a mile south of Talimena Scenic By-Way on 259, right on the west end of Rich Mt. She said it was about 35-40 ft off the road walking behind a tree. She described it as being 9-10 ft tall with stringy hair of varying shades of brown. She noticed it was bipedal with long arms swinging in the usual ''squatchy'' way. She was very firm when I asked if perhaps it was a bear and said that she knew what she saw. As my luck goes, we were at a point where the road was hairpin curves with no shoulders and no way to turn around. I guess I''ll have to wait for my first sighting. One thing she mentioned was noticing the muscles in the arms and legs. If this was a man in a suit they went to some trouble to pull it off. ",

    " This was late morning 11:25. I am hunting a thicket facing East. The area I am hunt runs North and South, I am at the far West side sitting on a fenceline.There are 175/200 grazing cattle behind me.A few calves spook as I walk up the fenceline to the split at the base of a willow tree that I sit at most all the time.But the cattle are used to seeing me there, a few seconds pass and they kept grazing. I sat ther all morning waiting on a deer or my brother to show up. As usuall he was late, so I was eating the cookies I packed for him. All of a sudden the cattle behind me and the other part of the herd across the other side of the pasture started stampeding to the center of the pasture. The cattle met in the center of the pasture and continued a thunder like stamped southward. I knew it was not me that starteled them but what.As I turned slowly and looked over my left shoulder I saw something walking on the far west fenceline heading northward. It stopped Twice and looked in my direction.A ice cold feeling shot down to my legs. The 6 strand barbwire fence came to its thigh or butt area. This thing? was about 81/2 to 9 feet tall,solid black,and covered ground in a way I have never seen. I thought if this is a man he would have to be a good jumper, but it did not look like it was in a hurry, just moving on. I was so caught off guard that I did not think to lift my rifle to get a better look, all I could do was just stare with my mouth wide open. My brother shown up about 30 minutes later and I asked him \" HOW DID YOU DO THAT \". He said he just parked his truck and started walking northward where he knew I would be, 11/2 miles north of where I lived. So that eliminated him.",

It was in 1987 it was hunting season I''m not sure the month. The two of us were walking along a dirt road in the Lockerplant river bottoms. Not sure which of us seen it first but definitely caught our attention.We were looking down a right of way when this large figure walked out of the trees. It walked along the tree line for several seconds going back into trees. At first we thought it was one hell of a big man or maybe someone hauling a deer across there shoulders. I remember asking [my friend] if that guy was wearing a fur coat. We knew what it was and it was not a man. The thing was at least 7 foot tall and covered in hair. It seemed to walk like a person, it was too far away to notice any details about face, hands or feet. I''m not sure but think it noticed us and that was the reason it never crossed the right of way.

    " In 1988 my wife, fiance at the time, and I were visiting my grandmother who was in her mid eighties at that time. She was living on some property that has been owned by my family for over half a century. She had spent a good portion of her life on this property. It was dusk and we were about to leave so we decided to sit on her porch before leaving. After sitting on the porch and talking for a while we heard a loud AHHHHHHHWW! It was coming from just inside the woods behind her house. Im pretty familiar with animal sounds, but couldnt identify this sound. I figured that since my grandmother lived there most of her life she would know what it was. I asked her about the sound and she said that she didnt know, but she said that she takes all her scraps and garbage to the edge of the woods every evening and lately she had the feeling that she was being watched. She also told me she had started carrying a garden hoe when she went out there. <BR><BR>In December of 1989 my friend and I went hunting on my family''s property near Caddo Lake. It was about two hours before dawn and we settled into our deer stands. My deer stand was on the edge of a pipeline clearing. My friends stand was in a thinly wooded area overlooking a small clearing about a quarter mile away from mine. I sat in my stand freezing my butt off. I didnt hear or see anything for almost an hour in the freezing temperatures. There was a full moon that night and it was pretty easy to see in the cleared areas. About an hour before the sun started to rise, I noticed something coming out of the woods. It began to walk down the opposite side of the pipeline clearing, towards me. It stayed in the shadows along the side of the wooded area it had exited. It was walking on two legs. At first I thought it maybe a hunter, but I looked hard to see if he had a gun and didnt see one. This was private property a mile off the nearest road and I didnt see a gun! It was also deer season, dark outside, and the woods are thick with trees, vines, and briars. This thing had just walked out of woods that are hard for me to walk through during the daytime without getting cutup from the briars. I couldnt imagine any person strolling through these woods at night during deer season. At first it was probably 75 yards away but it was getting closer. I thought maybe Im seeing things, but I decided to click the safety off on my gun just in case. Immediately after I had clicked off the safety, this thing heard it; it was barely audible to myself. I could tell it had turned my direction, because its shoulders were now turned towards me. Without missing a step it was now walking backwards while looking at me. After about four steps backwards, it quickly spun around and I couldnt count the steps after that, it took a few more steps and quickly exited the pipeline. It entered the woods at a different location from where it had exited. <BR><BR>I still couldnt believe what I had seen, but I kept watching where it entered the woods in case it came back out. I noticed one large tree a few yards back in the wooded area that was higher than the other smaller trees around. This tree began to shake violently. After that I was done hunting, but was too scared to exit my stand. I was certain that it had to be Bigfoot. Every noise I heard after that spooked me. I stayed in my tree-stand until my friend came and got me after the sun came up. I told him what I had seen. I dont know if he believed me but we went to look for tracks. We didnt find any tracks but we saw a well-worn trail on the ground where it had exited the woods. I couldnt enter this trail because the trees and briars were real thick. It looked as if small animals could only use this trail, as it was low to the ground. There was a freshly beaten path where it had reentered the woods. I was able to enter the where it had reentered. I noticed an old plastic pail hanging about five or six feet up on the tree that had been shook. I have no idea why this pail was there. Nothing was in it but pine straw. The woods were too thick from that point on and didnt see where it could have gone from that point.",

    " I am a truck driver for an over the road company, and I used to drive from IH35 in Texas, across to IH49 in Louisiana by way of TX84. The part of East Texas I ws driving in is very dense forrest, and is largly covered by brush. I was coming out of Mount Enterprise approx. 1 to 2 miles, there were no houses or cars anywhere in site. I saw a black fiqure on the side of the road that looked likea a large animal rolling on the ground like it was trying to scratch its self, it was night time (11:30 PM) but you could see well in the dark with the high beams and running lites on my rig. As I got closer it stood on its hind legs and started to walkng towards me on the left side of the road (walking from East to West). It appeared to be approx. 6 1/2 to 7 foot tall, I am really not sure of the height because i was driving at 60 MPH but I could tell it was very broad, and with the headlights in its eyes they appeared to be sort of reflecting the lite, like a possum or coyote or other wild animals would do at night. It was completely covered with hair, sort of a redish black looking color from what I could make out. it had a flat looking forhead and a flat looking nose and his mouth was hard to make out. When I drove past, it was jumping up and down on the side of the road, sort of hitting its chest like an ape. It never tried to run off in the woods like I heard they do when they see you. But I have thought about that and fiqured it may have been looking at all the lights on my trucka nd trailer. I drove for several hrs. after that and did not pass a dozen cars on the road. I went over in my head all night long trying to convience myself it was someone playing a joke in an ape suit, but they would have had to be widest person I have ever seen, with long arms. (almost th there knees) but to tell the truth I just dont know. I have not drove down that way since the occurance, and I dont care to. That would be the last place I would ever want to break down.",

    " As a teenager from the early seventies up until 1980, I hunted this area. Numerous times I had mentioned a smell to a friend which I described as somewhere between a skunk and a wet dog. My friend acknowledged that he had smelled it several times himself. We blew it off as being some type of plant or weed, but as I began smelling it more often I could tell it was some type of animal as opposed to a plant or weed. I began thinking that it was probably ferral hogs. As I continued to get older and continued to squirrel hunt these same areas, I began to notice that every time I smelled this odor, there were no squirrels moving or any wildlife for that matter. I do not know exact dates or even the year in which these incidents occured, but it was in the mid to late seventies. I have been reluctant to tell anyone about these incidents. <BR><BR>1978: The first visual experience that I had came deep in the woods from the road. I had walked about a mile down in the woods where I came upon a pinoak flat.I could see all the way through the flat to the other side which was about 150-175 yards. On the other side of the flat was a stand of reset pine all about 15 ft. tall with high dead grass underneath. Immediately I noticed something laying under a pine tree across the flat. At first it looked like the area below the tree and the trunk of the tree had been burnt out. As I eased closer it began to look like a gorrila laying under the tree. I am a pretty stealthy person in the woods and I told myself I am seeing things, but I am going to try and get closer to this thing just to prove to myself I am not seeing this. As I moved within 100 yards or so, I could see that I was not crazy. It''s head was moving and at this time I could tell it''s color was gray with a black gorrila face. The adrenalin kicked in, I checked my gun, put some trees between myself and this thing and proceded to try and get closer, peering around the trees every few feet to see if it was still there. I got to within 50-75 yards and peered around the tree and it was gone.The floor of the pinoak flat was dry with a lot of crunchy leaves and twigs. I knew I was going to scare it off before I could get as close as I liked. After I noticed that it was gone I sat down in the flat for about an hour and did not see any wildlife at all. I then got up and went over to area where I had seen it and was hit with \"that smell\" and the grass was mashed down underneath the pine. At first I don''t think that it knew I was there, because it was moving it''s head and acting unconcerned. As I tried to sneek up on it though, It deffinately sensed my presents or heard me crunch a twig. I know it never visually made me out, because I kept trees between myself and it the whole time.<BR><BR>1979: It had rained sometime between 3am and when I had set out to go squirrel hunting. It was very foggy and misty on this morning and the woods were damp and very quiet. I came upon a large thicket and sat down against a tree at the edge of the thicket. I instantly started to smell something. As it got lighter, light enough to shoot, I could hear something in the thicket. Also I noticed there were no squirrels moving. I thought that there were some hogs in the thicket. I sat in this spot longer than I normally would sit somewhere without seeing anything, because of the sounds I heard coming from the thicket. About mid morning I was hearing something sniffing the air and making low, deep, grunting sounds. This was no hog! I decided to play a trick that I have used before on game in thickets and throw a two foot section of a dead limb over and beyond the sounds hoping to flush it out to my side. When I did this it made a deep and louder primate type grunt at me. The sniffing of the air also became more pronounced and no hog breathes like this. I then threw another stick into the thicket and received the same grunts and sniffing, only louder. About 20 min later I heard it moving through the thicket and then heard a huge, two legged splash into a body of water on the other side of the thicket, followed by grunts and heavy breathing. There is no doubt in my mind what I had encountered was a bigfoot in the thicket. Although I never saw him, this was something I had never experienced in the woods before. After the splash and the exit, I made my own hasty exit back to the road.",

The quickest route to my mom and stepdad''s house is through Cleveland, Texas and take 105 from there to almost Kountz. [At] approximately midnight,  we left from Kingwood and traveled through Cleveland onto 105.<BR><BR>We had been on 105 about 20 minutes (about 45 minutes from Kingwood) we were approaching the Trinity River bottom when I noticed something in the center of the road.  My girlfriend was dozing beside me and I yelled thinking we were about to be in an accident.  She sat up and screamed that we were about to hit ''him''.  I locked the brakes of her truck up and when I did whatever it was stood up in the road and started to ''run'' to our right towards the woods.<BR><BR>My girlfriend, started to open her door and I grabbed her to stop her.  She yelled that it was a ''bigfoot''.  I had heard of them, I mean who hasn''t, but to be honest until that very moment, I would never have believed that they existed.  By the time I looked up from her the creature was standing on the side of the road watching us.  When she opened her door the creature made like a squalling sound and turned into the woods.<BR><BR>I think it was around 7 feet tall.  I am not too sure I do know it was quite a bit taller then myself.  It was black in color but it had what looked like mud on its legs and arms.  The fur or hair was long.  It was on my girlfriend''s side of the truck about 10 feet away and she said its hands were long and the thumbs were ''not right''.  I am not too sure what she meant other then they looked longer I think, too be honest not too sure how to describe that.<BR><BR>Where the thing was squatting in the road was a doe that had been hit by a car.  I am not sure if it was looking or feeding on the doe but it had been moved by it.  You could see where the creature had shifted the animal on the road or at least it looked like that when I got out to look.  I have read on here, when I decided to post the incident. that there was an ''oder'' a lot of times.

The face was devoid of hair. Coal black eyes, wide nose, very long arms and big hands. It was like I had surprised it. We stared at each other for about 10 seconds, when I cocked my 12 gauge. At that time it turned to its right and disappeared. VERY quickly. It was getting to be dusk but I did look for tracks and found none. There was no smell.

    " On January 9th, 2015 @ about 5:20-5:30 p.m. at Canyon Lake, Texas, my family and I were backing out of our drive way, and the weather was bad that day, kind of hazy, misty rain, and it was about 37 degrees. I had my high beams on because it was beginning to get dark outside.  As I backed out of the driveway my lights caught the attention of a very big creature about 9 foot tall grayish blonde in color with a 4 to 4 1/2 ft across from shoulder to shoulder, standing in front of an oak tree, it turn towards me from about 40 yards away, and it stood with its arms down at it''s side, I asked my son to look and I looked away briefly, when I looked back it was gone.  The following Friday my wife and step daughter, while walking along the shoreline of the lake, discovered a bloody and strange deer kill site (fresh kill), the deer''s neck was broken and twisted all he way around, lungs, heart, and liver were gone and the deer''s intestinal content was thrown about, the back half of the deer was eaten,the front shoulder was eaten,but not the other shoulder.<BR><BR>I called the BFRO and left a message, J.D. from San Antonio came out and took pictures of the scene, I asked him if I should roll the deer over because of the shoulder bone sticking out.  After rolling over I pulled the hide back and there was a sharp edged stone underneath the hide with flesh and blood on the stone--I kept this stone--there was also a 10 feet dragging kill-blood streak across the rocks, then it abruptly stops, and the deer''s carcass seems to be thrown about 15 feet from that spot with no blood stains in between the two spots.  Upon further investigating I discovered a 5 foot long stick about 1 1/4 in diameter-rigid, with a sharp end on it, and the end of it had deer hair and flesh on it, like it was used to either stab the deer or just to hold it down, then it broke the deers neck, the kill was made from the waters edge side not the woods side, meaning the thing that killed the deer was hiding in the water...I also discovered tracks some were 19 inches long but were not castable, not enough definition, also found some tracks that were 14 inches long, and some 11 inches long along the shoreline down from the kill site, all of them were not castable it had also been raining that whole week off and on.  Upon even more research we discovered At least 5 other deer carcasses in the general area.  Called area fish and game warden out and she walked the area and observed all of the evidence on Sunday January 18th..",

    " I was 19 years old at that time. I had just gotten out of high school just six months before. I had just gotten a job with a seismographic company.  My cousin also got on at the same company.  We were given a holiday break in December and told we would relocate to a town 56 miles south of Diamondville called Evanston, Wyoming after the holidays.<BR><BR> So after the holidays I, and my cousin relocated with them to Evanston. We worked togther on a crew of six men putting down and picking up seismic jugs. A van or and a helicopter would take to our work site from our base operation in Evanston every morrning and pick us up every night and take us back to Evanston.<BR><BR>  This went on day in and day out for about three weeks as we worked in the Uinta Mountains southeast of Evanston with out anything unusual happening. You would see the occasional mule deer or elk.<BR><BR>  On the morrning of the 15th of January our boss told us that he wanted the crew to go into the mountains and get some jugs we laid down two days before. He said he wanted some volunteers to do this job because there was a big winter storm moving in and we might get caught in the mountanis but that he would pay us double if we did this. So my cousin and I with four outher guys said we would do this. <BR><BR>  They flew us out to the work sight at around 7:30 a.m. we started picking up jugs and bagging them up, it was cold and clouded over. We were working on snow shoes and where going along at a pretty good clip. We stopped and took a short water break around 10:00 a.m. then went back to work. At around 11:00 a.m. it cut loose and started snowing lightly, but we kept on working untill we made to the top of this little hill at around 12:15 p.m. We stopped for lunch on top this hill over looking some heavy black timber.<BR><BR>  We started a little cooking fire to cook our lunches and to warm ourselves up. As we sat there talking about how many jugs we still had to pick up we figured it would be around 2:00 p.m. before we would be done with the job.  As we talked one of the guys pointed down the hill and said \"look there''s a bear\".  We all turned and looked and we saw something dark working its way through the timber.  At first it did look like a black bear working its way through the timber. Then it broke out of the timber about 500 yards from us. It was black with hair all over its body, except for its face which seemed to be sort of a lighter color. <BR> <BR>  It was walking upright on two legs like a man. Its arm were long and swinging back and forth and it was taking long strides with each step it took.  We couldn''t really see the face at first because it was walking with its right side to us. It didn''t seem to notice us at first and it was making sounds like someone talking to themself.<BR><BR>  I said in sort of a loud voice \"That''s not a bear! What the hell is that!\". One guy told me be quiet, but it must of heard us because it stopped and turned and looked right at us all standing on the hill above it. It was surprised to see us. It then turned and bolted into the timber breaking timber and brush as it went making all kinds of noise.<BR><BR>  At first we all just stood there dumbfounded at what we had just seen. Then all at once we heard a screaming moaning sound come out of the timber below us. That made our hearts stop for a minute. It sounded like a cougar and a woman screaming at the same time. <BR><BR>  Our foreman told us he didn''t know what it was, but he wanted to leave. We all made our way up to the hill over looking the hill we were on when we saw it. As we were half way up that hill it let out that scream again, only it seemed closer. That scream froze all of us in our tracks. To this day I can''t think about that with out feeling some terror inside myself.<BR><BR>When we got on top of the hill the foreman radioed Evanston and told them to send the helicopter to pick us up. It took them about 20 minutes to get there and pick us up because it started snowing really heavy.  They picked us up and took us back to Evanston but no one said a thing all the way back. We talked with each other about that night over some beers and decided not to say anything to anyone who wasn''t there.",

    " When I was 8 years old,while living in a forested portion of central Idaho, my little brother and I got up on a snowy February morning at dawn to watch cartoons. It was to early and only a test pattern was on the TV. We turned off the TV and my brother went back upstairs to bed. I opted to stay on the couch in my warm blankets and wait untill the cartoons started. <BR><BR>The couch was positioned along an outside wall beneath a row of 3'' wide x 5'' tall picture windows. These windows were approximately  7 feet from the ground on the outside. The <BR>19\" TV was sitting on top of a tall wood storage box next to the wood stove directly across from the couch. I could see the reflection of the windows in the darkened TV screen.<BR><BR>I dozed off for a while and was awakened by a noise which I thought was the snow sliding off the metal roof. I noticed a shadow shape in the window reflection nearest the stairs and at first thought it was a snow bank created by the snow off the roof. Then I saw the shadow move on to the next window and then it stopped at the window just past the head of the couch. I listened and heard some movement outside and also a sort of grunting noise. My heart started to race as I watched the mirrored reflection in the TV screen. Curiosity got the better of me and I sat up on my knees on the couch, leaned over the armrest, and looked out the window. I will never forget what I saw!<BR><BR>There, just a few feet away was a sasquatch peering in the window. It was scanning the room with obvious curiosity. After a couple of seconds it sensed my movement and looked directly into my eyes. The face looked like a gorilla but with longer hair and \"smarter eyes\". It was not like the dark black eyes you see on other forest animals.<BR><BR>Terrified, I dove off the couch and scurried on my hands and knees toward the bottom of the staircase. I tried to call out for my mom but my voice didn''t work. I was afraid the bigfoot would hear me. Finally, I gave out a few meager calls and my mom finally appeared on the balcony above the room. \"What''s the matter?\" she said. \"There is a bigfoot outside.\" I whispered. At that point I started to cry and shake. Sensing that something had terrified me , she said,\"Well get up here then.\" I was still afraid to move. She said she couldn''t see anything outsde from up there ,so I flew up the stairs using my hands and feet. My mom knew I wasn''t joking around and she wouldn''t let my brother and I outside to play in the snow untill later in the afternoon. My brother saw the holes in the snow where I thought the animal stood but snow had partially filled them and he wouldn''t believe my story.<BR><BR>Years later, a friend of my moms, who knew about my sighting, gave her an old local newspaper with a story in it about multiple bigfoot sightings occuring with in a 30 mile radius of home during that 1979 time period.",

    " I was in rural Idaho, just north of a small town called Priest River. My friend and I go up to his ranch every year or so and just live there for a month. He has a dog that we bring along and like every other dog, he has the occasional need to relieve himself. So it was nighttime and it was my turn to take the dog out so I picked up an old Ruger 10-22 and brought the dog out for him to urinate. I was waiting outside when I saw a dark figure just beyond the tree line. It was massive, easily twice my height, and it just stood there, watching me. I would have taken a shot with my rifle but a tiny .22lr round wouldn''t do anything to a creature that size. I just stood there looking back at it, when suddenly it broke out into a stride along the length of the tree line and it silently disappeared into the night. I was frozen in place until the dog tugged on the leash, beckoning me inside. I quickly gathered myself and rushed in through the door. I never saw clearly what was lurking in the darkness but I''m sure that it was Bigfoot. ",

    " Editor''s Note: The original submission is not from the witness, but rather his mother  who he called right after he had the experience. A BFRO investigator subsequently interviewed the witness. Those notes are shown below. Hence, this is not a second-hand report (only first-hand reports are allowed in the BFRO database, with very limited exceptions).<BR><BR>Original submission:<BR><BR>I am writing this for my son David. He called me this morning about 1:30 AM. He was excited and upset and told me and his dad that he finally believes us about Bigfoot. He was on the I15 going south when He came to some fog he told me he put his fog lights on so he could see better with out his main lights being on. He stated that he saw some eyes glowing so he turned on his head lights and he saw a bigfoot running in front of his semi truck. He swerved to keep from hitting it. After he got the truck under control he pulled off to the side was he was spooked out. <BR><BR>He said I know for a fact that they exist now. He has always been skeptic about them. He said it was like looking into a gorillas face. They had eye to eye contact. Only it walked upright like a man but was hairy all over. His leg was the size of his body he told me. so he asked me to right this for him. He is a true believer now.<BR><BR>Notes from Investigators Interview with the Witness:<BR><BR>This interview took place on August 21, 2008.<BR><BR>I talked to the witness on the phone for about an hour and he described what he called a hell of an experience. He told me he used to drive truck all over the United States (but doesnt do it anymore). He told me that when the experienced happened he was carrying a load of potatoes from Idaho. He was on I-15 southbound toward Saint George, Utah. <BR><BR>At around 1:30 to 2:00 a.m. the witness was going up an incline on the road and drove into a small patch of fog and turned his fog lights on. The fog wasnt heavy at first, but as he reached the top of the hill and dropped from tenth gear down into ninth gear, the fog got heavy. At about this time he noticed the reflection of somethings eyes  he thought a deer - off to the side of the road, and he turned his bright lights on. <BR><BR>At this point in our conversation the witness told me he had always been skeptical about bigfoots. Hes an avid hunter and spends about eighty percent of his free time hunting and fishing, but had never run across a bigfoot or any evidence of one - and thus didnt think they existed. But, the witness said that when he put his lights on bright, even though he didnt want to believe it, he was seeing a bigfoot, sasquatch, or whatever you want to call it. It went striding across the road - from the witnesss left to his right - with big, long strides. <BR><BR>The witness almost hit the creature and had to swerve to the middle of the freeway to miss it. He somewhat lost control of his truck, and almost wrecked the truck. He managed to get his truck back under control and, after about another 200 to 300 yards, pulled off to the side of the road and came to a complete stop. He kept looking back in his mirrors - not wanting to believe what he had just seen. He says it scared the hell out of me and he says his thought at the time was Im getting the hell out of here. <BR><BR>The witness then drove away from the scene, scared and shook up. He drove another four-hundred miles and was wide awake the whole time.<BR><BR>The witness said the creature was initially about thirty to forty yards away, when he first saw the eyes, and that when he turned on the bright lights it was only about twenty feet away. He also stated that at one point in the experience the creature turned and looked at him. <BR><BR>The witness emphasized several times the point that he hadnt believed in bigfoots before the incident, despite the fact that his step-father had claimed to have had a bigfoot encounter (see \"Other Stories\" below). He says I was probably one of the biggest skeptics. Right after the witness experience he called his mother and step-father to tell them about his experience. He has no doubt that what he saw was a bigfoot. He says hes seen a lot of bears before, and actually hunts bears every year, and he says he knows for certain that the upright creature he saw wasnt a bear. <BR><BR>The witness estimates he only saw the creature for about ten seconds, but he was still able to relate some information to me about what the creature looked like. He said it looked almost identical to the creature in the Patterson film footage. He says it had black hair, and that it had big eye brows - like you would see on a gorilla. <BR><BR>The witness saw the creature eye to eye from up high in his big truck and thus estimates it to have been at least eight to ten feet tall. He thinks the weight may have been between 600 and 800 pounds, and he says it appeared stout. It had long, lanky arms  proportionally longer than a humans.   <BR><BR>I asked the witness if the creature was running and he said no  it was just striding, with long strides that covered a lot of ground. He said two to three steps, and it was across the freeway.<BR><BR>I asked the witness about weather conditions and he said it was brisk, with snow on the ground. <BR><BR>The witness was sincere in relating this experience  at one point saying I swear up and down I know what I seen - I know what I almost hit - it looked right at me, and later adding I know what I saw and it freaked me out. He said hes a lot more alert now to whats around him.<BR><BR>",

Anyway, we were driving on Baseline Rd., between 51 Ave. & 67 Ave. going west.  Myself, my wife, and nephew, saw maybe two cars swerve around in the road ahead. As we approached, I slowed down, and then a creature stepped across half the road in front of us and into and across a small canal and onto a golf course. By then I had turned my scout around deciding to use 51 Ave. instead of using 67 Ave.  I asked every one what they saw and their response was, bigfoot, except for my wife who just wanted out of the area.  As far as the description, it was big and tall with dark matted stringy hair.  I could not see its face very well, because I was too busy turning the scout around. The creature didn''t seem to care if we were there, it just stepped across the road ignoring the cars.  There is very little traffic in this area at night.\t<BR>",

    " It was between Christmas and New Year''s Day 1983 at about 8:00 P.M.  I went to pick up a friend at her parents home for an evening out, about one half miles south of Strawbery, Arizona off of Highway 87. There is a dirt lane that leads between a quarter to a half mile from the highway to their home.  This lane cuts through a ponderosa pine forest. It was on this lane on our way back to the highway that we saw the sasquatch.  <BR><BR>He entered from out of the woods on our left, crossed the dirt lane in front of us and entered into the woods on our right. Although it was after dark, we were able to see him quite clearly in our headlights. We were moving slowly.  <BR><BR>I would estimate him to have been about 7 feet tall and to have weighted about 400 pounds.  He was covered in a light colored hair, similar to that of a camel in color. He walked upright on two legs and had the gait of a human, as his arms swung in time with his steps. He never looked directly at us, but continued to look stright ahead and to maintain his stride across the lane.  He did not seem to appear scared or startled by the presence of our car or it''s headlights. It was as if he knew that he had time to cross the lane in front of us.  <BR><BR>His body shape was not like that of a bear. It was proportioned to that of a man of that height and weight, but it had a barrel chest.  My friend and I were both surprised by it, but were not uneasy about it because he did not make any meancing jestures. It seemed like it paid no attention toward us at all.  <BR><BR>My biggest regret now is that I did not return the next day to look for footprints.  Even though he did not appear meancing, I certainly would not have followed him into the woods.  I''ve often wondered if he could have possiblely used our headlights on purpose to illuminate his path across the lane.  <BR><BR>I know that this report is twenty years old, but it is an accurate and true account of what we saw and I hope that it is of some use to you in your research.  <BR><BR>Strawberry is located on the slope of the Mogollon Rim at an elevation of approximately 5000 feet.  I lived in Pine, Arizona at this time. Strawberry is only two miles away, but increases in elevation by 500 feet. Payson is the nearest town of any size and is 17  miles to the south.

    "Perhaps, the most \"burnt in\" recollection of the sighting was the look of absolute surprise on the creature...We were close enough to SEE (and almost SENSE how very startled it was by us being suddenly eye-to-eye with us. This was not some lower animal response. This was an intelligent human like, ''Oh crap- you saw me and where did you come from'' look of surprise, as it stared at us just prior to running down and off the elevated highway.The creature was SIGNIFICANTLY larger than even the largest of human beings (NO WAY THIS WAS A HUMAN BEING DRESSED IN COSTUME AS \"BIGFOOT\"). While, we were sitting in an auto, I can still say, with a high degree of accuracy, that the creature was eight to nine feet tall. The body mass was stout, thick in the chest/trunk, and very muscular. Even though 90% hair covered, you could see outline of significant \"muscle definition and mass\". This is much better than a guess; it weighed upwards of 500-600 lbs. I can remember many details of creature: hair 90%, dirty skin tone, where there was leathery skin 10%, arm length, relative appendage size, and the biometrics of the approximate 15 mph running gate...Even the highly expression (because of the surprise) on its eyes... The other witness, I am quite certain, will have an equally vivid recollection.",

    " This report describes a sighting of a large biped primate at Fort Hunter Liggett on the evening of Saturday, February 16, 2002.  I left my home in Manhattan Beach, California about 8:00 AM on the morning of February 16th after one last unsuccessful attempt to persuade my son to join me for a long weekend of wild pig hunting.  Monday was Presidents Day, my son was off school, and the Fort was open for hunting.  But 16-year old boys have other interests.  I arrived at the Fort about 12:30 PM alone, checked into Training Area 10/13 to hunt, and stopped at the Hacienda for lunch and to claim my room for the weekend.  After changing to camouflage clothing and hunting boots I headed up Sulfur Springs Road to where Training Area 10/13 begins.<BR><BR>About 4:30 PM I stopped to look at a creek that crosses under Sulfur Spring Road near Lyons Pond in Area 7 as I drove Northeast.  I learned of the creek that is often used as a wallowing spot, on a guided hunt in 1999.  From the road I could see much recent activity.  It appeared as though quite a few pigs had been wallowing in the small creek the night before.  I drove on about 150 yards and parked my Bronco along Sulfur Spring Road.  <BR><BR>I climbed down the 20-foot high embankment to the creek to check the area more carefully.  There were very fresh wallows all along the creek with many fresh droppings in addition. I walked on to Lyons Pond, which was dry, and returned to Sulfur Springs Road.  All of the fresh sign was in Area 7 at the edge of the road, but I was registered to hunt in Area 10/13on the other side of the road.  This is an important distinction at Hunter Liggett.  If you are caught with a loaded gun in an Area you are not registered to hunt, you are banned from the Fortforever.<BR><BR>I solved this conflict by noticing that the pigs appeared to be using a large culvert to cross under the road from Area 10/13 to Area 7.  I decided that I would wait for their return on the 10/13 side of the road.  I positioned myself about 10 yards off, and 20 feet below the road.  My hope was that the pigs would be traveling up the creek through Area 10/13 to Area 7 just after the sun set.  It was about 5:00 PM when I took my position with determination to not move until 30 minutes after sunset.  <BR><BR>The first hour of waiting was pretty boring.  Nothing was moving and the forest was eerily quite.  About an hour before sunset the woods began to show signs of life.  A few Blue Jays and Woodpeckers flew by and a few frog croaks resonated from the small creek I was watching.  Closer to sunset I noticed two does moving through the woods and squirrels scampering about.  I knew that if the pigs returned to the creek it would be in those magical 30 minutes after sunset and that time was just arriving!  <BR><BR>Much to my disappointment, a blue Ford Ranger also arrived as the sunset.  Two hunters climbed out, grabbed their rifles and walked down a small, grassy road that entered the woods about 75 feet from where I was sitting.  I watched them pass and disappear on the road that was slightly above my hidden sitting position.  My hopes of a pig encounter of the close kind were dashed.  I was certain these hunters would either intercept my prey or scare them away with their movement and noise.  <BR><BR>I was heartened a few minutes latter as I saw both hunters returning along the road to their truck.  I watched them carefully with my new Swarovski binocular.  It was about 10 minutes after sunset and without the binocular they appeared as shadows in the darkening forest.  With my Swarovski binocular I could see details of the weaving in the plaid hunting jacket one was wearing and the rifles they were carrying.  They climbed into their truck and drove offleaving me with 15 more minutes of wild pig hope.<BR><BR>These minutes passed slowly as I glassed the forest in search of movement.  The frogs in the creek began a loud chorus that added to the excitement.  There was lots of movement but no signs of pigs.  Chipmunks and squirrels were scampering about and I saw a coyote moving in the distance.  Drizzle started to fall, along with my hopes, as the last few minutes of hunting time expired.  I resolved to return to the same spot in the morning as I put the lens covers on my binocular and gather up my backpack and rifle.<BR><BR>But before I could stand up I saw a flash of light color a few 100 yards back into the forest.  I had no idea what I had seen out of the corner of my eye.  The color was white or silver-gray, not a color that I would expect to see on a wild pig.  I looked off into that direction for a few seconds before seeing another brief flash of the same light colored object.  Both confused and intrigued I watched as repeated flashes of white or silver-gray coloring appeared in the forest.  Whatever it was appeared to be moving and after about 20 seconds of watching I realized that it was moving in my direction along the same road the two hunters had walked earlier.<BR><BR>I believed I watched this creature move through the forest for about two or three minutes before I finally got a clear, unobstructed view of it against a light sky background.  My attitude was relaxed but attentive as I tried to figure out what I was seeing.  Patches of silver-gray flashed through openings in the forest, sometimes high, sometimes low!  My attitude changed to surprise and fright as I saw it take 4 or 5 full steps in a 30-foot clearing along the raised road, 75 feet from where I was sitting.  I was wide-awake, completely sober, free from any medications, and completely focused on this approaching object.  I was alone, watching with my naked eyes, and heavily armed.  I had a Model 70 in 300 Winchester magnum in my hands and was carrying a Tarus Raging Bull in 454 Casull on my belt.  <BR><BR>What the hell was it?  <BR><BR>I dont know!  <BR><BR>It was walking completely upright on two legs.  <BR><BR>It was very large.  I estimate that it was 8 feet tall and weighed 800 lbs.  Not 30 minutes before I had watched two hunters cross the same 30-foot opening and had thought how small they looked.  In contrast, I was surprised at how big this creature was.<BR><BR>It was covered with silver-gray hair from its very pointed head to its feet.  The only difference in coloration was a dark facial mask and similar colored palmsbrown or black.<BR><BR>I saw this creature in side profile and could make out few facial features.  What I could see appeared very flat, with little nose or chin protruding.  The silver-gray hair on the head rose about 8 from the top of the facial mask to a pronounced point at the top of the skull.  The head blended into the body without any visible neck in between.<BR><BR>The silver-gray hair on the arms was about 4 inches long.  I could see this clearly as these very long, heavily muscled arms swung in cadence with its fast, uninterrupted, strides.  Bulging back and shoulder muscles flexed visibly under the hair as it strode along the road.<BR><BR>It was not carrying nor wearing anything.  Both hands were empty.  There were no shoes, belt, pack or anything else that would suggest cultural development or advanced intelligence.<BR><BR>Four long, powerful strides in a clear opening against the still light Western sky and it was gone!  <BR><BR>I was dumbfounded!  What the hell had I just seen?  It took me about 10 seconds to grab my backpack and start running up the 10 grade to Sulfur Spring Road to get another look.  I slipped to one knee as I scrambled up the hill and pulled my Raging Bull out of its holster as I reached the road.  My heart was racing and my hands were trembling but it wasnt from the runningI was pretty damn scared!<BR><BR>It was 40 minutes past sunset, but I was looking West toward an open field on the other side of the road, the direction in which this creature was headed.  There was nothing movingI couldnt see or hear any sign of what I had just seen.  I walked slowly down the center of the Sulfur Spring Road toward the point where the other road connected.  I called out a number of times to see if anyone or anything would respond.  Nothing did.  After a few minutes I slowly walked backward down the center of Sulfur Spring Road toward my Bronco that was parked about 200 yards East of where I had been hunting.<BR><BR>I jumped in and locked the doors!  I turned it around and slowly drove back toward the Hacienda with the bright lights searching for any signs of movement along the road.  The drizzle turned to serious rain as I reached the Hacienda.  I went directly to the restaurant for dinner and a few glasses of wine.  I chatted with two other hunters seated at the same table.  We exchanged stories of seeing deer and fresh pig sign in the areas we had hunted.  They told me of seeing a flock of wild turkeys run across their path in Area 7, not far from the Hacienda.  I didnt say a word about what I had just seen.  I was sure they would think I was nuts.   I was sure because I was beginning to wonder myself!<BR><BR>It rained hard all night.  <BR><BR>A heavy rain continued until about 11:00 AM Sunday morning.  <BR><BR>I left the Hacienda an hour before sunrise on February 17th headed back to the spot where I had seen this unbelievable creature.  I parked in the same spot as the day before, and loaded my rifle and pistol before I unlocked the door as the sky began to gray in the East.  I watched the creek for pigs until about 30 minutes after sunrise, then began looking for footprints along the small road where I had seen what appeared to be a silver-gray Sasquatch.<BR><BR>The road was covered with grass and extended only about 200 yards from Sulfur Spring Road to where it dead-ended at a small ravine. There were few patches of bare dirt and no tracks.  Either the grassy road didnt show tracks or the rain had washed them away. Or, perhaps, there had been nothing to leave tracks in the first placeonly an over active imagination!<BR><BR>From the end of the road I slowly still-hunted toward an adjacent ridge.  It was a few hundred feet above the surrounding ground and offered a good vantage point to glass for movement.  While I kept my eyes open for pigs, I was really looking for something silver-gray.  I saw neither.  At noon, I returned to Sulfur Spring Road and walked back into Area 7.  Lyons pond had little new water in it despite the heavy rain over the last 18 hours.  There were few pig and deer tracks on the bare dirt as the heavy rain had washed most of the tracks away.  I saw no sign of any tracks that might have been left by the beast I saw the night before.  <BR>",

    " My husband and I were hunting in Sonora. Our location was Eagle Meadows which is above Strawberry, California off of California Highway 108. It was a sunny, cold day.  We dressed in our camoflauge and began our hunt.  We were deep in the woods had climbed down a hillside of boulders and into what looked like a perfect hunting area.  Forest on either side of a meadow approximately 300 yards wide. We found pine trees to sit under (they had low branches) to await our perfect buck and so put on our skunk scent. My husband was approximately 10 feet away from me.  We each had views across the meadow.  But I could not share his nor could he share my view for there was a clump of trees and bushes about 100 yards in front of us and positioned between the trees we were under.   About 20 minutes into the hunt we heard branches breaking across the meadow.  My husband quietly told me to be aware of bears.  To stay alert.  It was approximately 10:30/11:00 a.m. when I looked back across the meadow and saw something that wasn''t there 3 to 5 minutes ago.  Immediately, I thought \"Could it be a Bear?\"  I rationalized if it was only shadows from trees, a dead log with light coming through?  But none of my theories fit. The image I saw was black.  The sun was shining from behind it so the front looked black.  Then I thought \"It must be a Sasquatch.\"  I saw most of his head, 3/4''s of his chest area and down to what could possibly be the waist.  The rest was hidden by the trees/bushes.  After totally analyzing the figure, the blackness, I thought if it is a bigboot it must have eyes.  I brought my small camouflage binoculars up to my eyes slowly and looked across this meadow.  It was then that fear and anxiousness prevailed.  For I saw two yellow eyes watching me very intently.  I have never been so scared.  I was afraid to move an inch.  I continued observing for about 15 minutes and he stood there and watched me too.  We were both very still.  I was wondering if he would move, why he was so intent on observing me?  Then my instinct told me to move and get out of there.  I motioned to my husband that I was going back to camp but did not tell him why.  My fear didn''t allow me to speak.  My intent was to leave the area as quickly as possible. I high-tailed it back to camp.  Up the stoney hillside and through the woods all the time looking over my shoulder.  Later when my husband came in I asked him if he saw anything unusual?  He said he didn''t.  So the Bigfoot didn''t walk across the meadow or my husband would have seen him.   The Sasquatch found me.  I was there under that tree first, minutes before he came into the area.  I honestly believe without a doubt that this was a Sasquatch.  I do not believe that it was a dangerous threat to me or it would have advanced towards me.  I do not believe it was a bear because a bear would not have stood still for so long.  I wonder if these creatures are just as about us as we are of them.  If only I could go back to that point in time.  I would have slowly moved across the meadow towards it, to see what it would have done and to investigate farther.   My husband said, \"What would you have done if it charged you?\"  I said, \"Run and scream.\"  My point is, how will anyone ever know the truth if they don''t cautiously and tamely approach one.  Would love the opportunity to go on a real sighting and/or search.  The opportunity to see a Sasqatch in motion would be awesome.",

    " Christmas Eve 2003, my wife and I spent XMas in Twain Harte, CA with friends.  This area is deep in the Sierra Mountains and has plenty of snow during the winter months.  <BR><BR>We stayed at our friends cabin, which sleeps twelve people with no problem. The cabin is about six to eight feet off the ground and the only way in is by using wooden stairs to climb into it.<BR><BR>There was plenty of snow and we were warned about walking on the porch. To get to the porch we had to go through the house.  The cabin was warm with the great wooden heater even though the windows had no coverings.  <BR><BR>Christmas Eve was upon us and the traditional events came and went.  After midnight, everyone eventually went to bed and retired for the night.  I was sleeping in a room by the porch and the windows like I said before, had no curtains or shades.<BR><BR>I could see very little from all the windows except for one, which was near the outside porch light.  I could see a small portion of the porch from that window. <BR>\t<BR>I went to sleep as did everyone else, but was awakened several hours later.  There was a slight movement all around the cabin like a small earthquake.  I turned over thinking just that.<BR><BR>Moments later, I felt movement again but this time it felt like someone was walking on the porch.  I sat up to look around and did not see anything or anyone.  <BR><BR>I decided to use the restroom since I was awake and eventually found my way back to bed.  It was then that I noticed something moving by the porch light. At first, I thought it was a man with long brown hair, but then noticed that it had hair on its arms and back.<BR><BR>After a better look, it had hair all over its body, but it seemed more of an orange-brown color.  Frightened as can be, I just kept looking at this thing.  It had its back towards me for several minutes and then slowly turned to look in my direction.  I was about twenty feet from the window so I am certain that it did not see me.  It leaned over to see through the window.  <BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t<BR>I would estimate it to have been about six foot six inches tall.  Its weight was about three hundred pounds and well proportioned.  I compared  compared the beast to a friend who is six foot two inches tall and weights three hundred pounds.  It looked fairly young like a teenage boy.<BR><BR>There was also no odor as this thing walked around.  The face was more like a caveman but very sad looking.  I could barely see its eyes in the dark, but I noticed them when it looked left and right. They seemed to be dark brown.  <BR><BR>The beast was frightening when it turned and looked in towards the window.  Its chest was like that of a male and I am assuming that it was not quite a grownup yet.  It was searching for something but I dont know what.  I also noticed that our friends dogs were no where to be heard or found in the cabin.<BR><BR>After a quick scan of the room, it turned and headed towards the porch rail.  Eventually, it jumped from the porch, which was a six to eight foot drop.  In the morning, I did not mention this event to anyone nor did I go looking for evidence.   <BR><BR>I believe there are different species scattered around the world.  I always believe they existed but my thoughts were reinforced with this citing.  This is also the first time anyone has heard or read this story from me. ",

    " It was a typical winter afternoon in Humbolt County, it was raining intermitantly and the river was on the rise and becoming too turbid to fish.  But, I wanted to catch another steele before the river blew out so, I drove down to the river bar as described in the \"Where did it occur?\" section of this report.  <BR><BR>I parked about 30 yards away from the rivers edge, on a dirt road surrounded by dense willows.  I turned off the car and opened the door.  Immediatly I heard two bellows that seemed far off.  I initially thought it was local kids.  The best I can do to discribe the noise is to ask you to try and make it--- put your lips togeather as if to make the sound of a \"B\" then bellow \"Whoooooooop\", wait two seconds and do it again. This is what I heard.  <BR><BR>To this day I can physically emulate the soud. The sound was similar to the bugle of a bull elk.  I used to work as a horse patrol park ranger on the eastern slope of the Rockies in Rocky Mountain National Park, I kept visitors away from the elk.  In addition, I have frequently heard elk bugle near Oric, CA. I know the bugle of an elk.  That''s not what this was.  <BR><BR>Well, I didn''t think much of it so I got my wadders on and proceeded to the rivers edge.  I wadded in up to my thigh and began fishing moving slowly down stream.  The river was probably about fifty yards wide and nearly at bank full about ten minutes went by and I noticed a dark figure down stream an accross the river, seemingly standing behind a large root wad.  I could see what I though was a head and shoulders of a bear or something? It was drizzeling and I couldn''t focus on it at first, I wasn''t sure it was an animal I thought it might just be part of the root wad.  <BR><BR>As I fished down stream I worked my way dirrectly accross from it and looked at it again, I looked right into its eyes, they were dark, it didn''t move. I then saw another to its left, I could see its body from <BR>the thigh up, it didn''t move, it was looking slightly down stream and I couldn''t see its eyes.  <BR><BR>These things looked taller than a man, had flat faces and large round eyes, their shoulders were broad and their arms were long, they were mostly covered in hair although the one on the left seemed to have bald spots on its chest area, like mange.  They stood still, never once moved.  Ikept fising and tried to work down stream of them to a tailout wher I could cross and sneek up on them to get a closer look, the river was to high.  <BR><BR>As I worked back upstream I noticed a cacoon shaped object perched on the root wad overhanging the rivers edge.  It was shaped like a foot ball but was probably 4 feet long and 21/2 feet in diameter (hard to tell at 50 yards).  This cacoon like thing appeared to be neetly wrapped in dry grasses like cat tail or pampas grass blades.  I kept fishing moving upstream of them back toward my car, at one point I looked back to get another look anfd the cacoon like thing and the animals were gone.  A day later I drove to the other side of the river to go see if I could track um but the river had flooded the entire area.  <BR><BR>I don''t follow Big Foot stuff, but I do know no bones have ever been found.  As a scintist this encounter has stimulated me to develope a theory.. I theorize that they warn eachother with this BWhooooop sound, and that the reason we have never found their bones is that they cleverly dispose of them by waiting till the rivers are on the rise, packaging the bones, and putting them in the rivers close to their mouths so that they wash out to sea.  I''m not sure I belive in any of this but thats what I saw and heard and thats my theory.  My second theory is that it was an elaborate hoax preformed by somm sort of Big Foot fan club or somthing.  But why would some one do that on an empty river bar I was the only one there and no one knew I was going to be there.<BR><BR>   ",

    " I had a visual experience in 1979 in which I was camping about 20+ miles out of Hiouchi,CA in Del Norte County. I was traveling as a passenger with a local resident who was making a trip to Crescent City to go grocery shopping. It was @ 11:00 a.m., a bright sunny morning. As I rode along, the lady giving me a ride into town told me to look out my window to the right. I looked to see what she was talking about and I saw a very large hairy creature walking across a wide, dried up creekbed.There were no trees or anything blocking my view. It was a wide open expanse.<BR><BR>I did not see its face because I was seeing it from the side. I only saw it on its right side. It was headed in the opposite direction that we were going. To our left I distinctly remember a \"watch out for falling rock sign.\" I do not know the area there well. I was only camping there for a few days on my way back from Topanga Canyon in L.A. to Oregon where I lived in the Cave Junction area.<BR><BR>I will never forget what it looked like. It had long darkish brown hair that covered its entire body. It also had a pronounced crown in the shape of the top of his head. It looked extremely muscular. I was at least 500''away and I''m not real good at judging height anyways, so I don''t know how tall it was. <BR><BR>It walked with ease across a rocky creekbed. It seemed to ignore or be unaware of our car''s presence on the road. We were probably traveling about 30 mph when it happened. <BR><BR>My friend told me she sees them all the time out there near her home, so it was just a normal thing for her.<BR><BR>",

    " i went fishing with my girlfriend at stumpy meadows last winter. we been up their about five days out of the week. early in the morning we would arrive try to get the line in the water as much as possible. the rest of the time i would be looking for gold. we mostly stuck around the dam and the spillway. my gold fever and wanting to catch a trout with my fly poll got me to wonder down along the spill way. the hole time i couldnt shake the bad filling i had well we had. it was the hair on the back of your neck being watched felling. i was at the vary bottom of the spillway in the middle of the stream standing on a rock fishing. my girlfriend was about twenty feet away panning. she said something lick lets get otta here somethings watching us. i told her i was catching it for awhile now to. so we climbed out of our little spot and onto a service rode that ran along the spillway. the hole time rubbernecking left right and especially behind us .some thing was putting the creep on us and was getting closer. we were walking as fast as you could without running or looking like you were scared sh**liss .but we both knew if one or the other broke and made for the car you might be last. so we held our ground and walked as casually as could be. i informed her that something was up on the other side of the spillway the hole time we were their watching us. and it was keeping pace with us as we made our way up the steep road. the thing behind us came from down bellow us on the same side of the stream and it was following just far enough not to be seen. we would stop it would stop. im a native american from auburn, and some of my relatives live in foresthill. and ive spent many nights with my cousins hunting though hills. Ive been followed by mountain cities a couple times. so i know the experience when thats the case. this was not the case sadly, if you were there you could say sadly, i would much rather a cat follow me somehow. but just in case it was a cat driving us or not. i told her to lock and load. that usually does the trick for the hiby jibys but not this time. the things present made my firearm fill like it was a rubber band and folded paper, and extra weight for when she bolted before me to the car. the last twenty feet to the car was easy. the thing had stopped about seventy feet before the car i stood watch as she loaded the car in record speed. a inflatable two man canoe four fishing poles ice chest, tackle, fit in the back set of my camero some how in thirty seconds. we pulled out of the entrance way and on to the road in the middle of the dam. it was dark by now  no cars nothing all day. we got out to gather ourselves and unload and put away the pistols, while she did that i walked back towered the spillway something big and black came up and around the spillway and up the other side of the hill were the other thing was. i was about one hundred feet from were they were. i didnt feel the fear as before. in a gap between some cwaycky brush one large thing and two smaller things followed. i yelled hey loudly. the things gurgled some what back at me. they kept this up as they walked up over the hill from me. it was some what like four quick gereag gereag gereag gerags, than lick two than a couple more. than they some what repeated the same sequence again. all the while  walking up over the crest of the hill, into the darkness. it reminded me of a mother giving me a tongue lashing or her children one after a close call. well thats what i related it to, but what was fact is it was talking something. im not to certain on the right number of individual words there were but it definitely was in some sort of sentence structure, stopped than repeated again.",

    " On December 3 , 2011 we were heading east on hwy 96. We live in Happy Camp Calif. We left around 6pm we were going to Redding Ca. to pick up my son from the Grey Hound Bus station We passed a few cars coming the oppiset direction so every so often I had to dim my head lights. We were about one and a half hours in to the drive. I had to dim my head light''s again and as we just passed,8 mile bridge I figured that I should hit the brights lights as we went around a vary slight curve (thats when) I hit the brights at that same moment a large rock (bolder ) stood up (straight up). It looked at us (me) It was a light grey color and had long shaggy hair. It had big eyes that looked yellow ( from the head lights would reflect off an animal?) I drive a 2001 Jeep Cherokee it was a lot bigger (taller) than my Jeep 4x4. It stood vary still except for its head it fallowed the car. When it stood up my mind went blank and I took my foot off the excelorator, we had a vary good long look at him maybe about 15-20 seconds it felt like forever.  The Jeeps head lights were on him the whole time! He seemed vary startled like we spooked him. To me he looked like he was trying to blend in with the surrounding mountain side I wrote a letter and a map I tried to paste it on this form. I had 4 of my children with me and 3 of them had seen him the 4th was asleep this time of year their are lots of rocks all over the hwy we were almost to the I-5 on ramp. When I came back to my senses I screamed so did everyone else and hit the gas and got out of their quickly we drove to the rest area and I had to get out of the car to breathe and stop shaking we all had to calm down. Now any time we have to go to town my son asks me if we are going to Yreka way if so he gets vary afraid.

    " :  This sighting occurred quite some time ago, and I haven&#8217;t told a lot of people.  I was a logger for 15 years, in and around northern California, and I was a timber faller, probably 5 years out of that period. Timber falling puts you out in the really remote areas, and we were always the first guys in there to drop the timber. I started working a real thick area, and began working my way back threw the thick woods, my plan was to reach the very back portion of the sale, and then cut my way back toward the logging road.<BR><BR>The first day in there, I had the feeling of being watched, thinking it was just our boss spying on us, so I gave no further thought to it.  The next morning I spotted large tracks in the muddy areas.  It had rained hard that night, so the tracks were not sharp, and they were not from a bear.  Further into the woods, I came up on a flat spot in the faint trail that smelt so terrible, that I almost gagged.  It smelled like wet dog, a very filthy wet dog. Just past this spot is where I spotted what appeared to be human droppings. What was weird about the dropping is they were really huge, not trying to act like an expert on droppings, but the largest piece was about 18inches long, and 3inches in diameter. This really freaked me out, because there was no body else in the area. My partner was working over the other slope, and actually went out another way. The cruisers were out of this area about two months back.  This stuff was fresh looking, about a day or two old, tops. <BR><BR>My partner was a Kroch Indian, and I didn&#8217;t know the guy that well, we just paired up for that season. At quitting time, I sort of approached him about the idea of bigfoot, and he said, &#8220;they have been in these woods for ever, and my people have told me many stories about them.&#8221;  &#8220;You white guys just make fun of what ever the Indian talks about, so we keep it to ourselves.&#8221; And, that was about it. I guess if I took him to a bar on Friday night, and got his tongue oiled up a bit, I&#8217;d have learned a bit more, but I dropped the subject.  We finished the sale and that was it. This area was really secluded with lots of deer sign.  I had a habit of mapping and remembering really good spots for future deer hunting, and prospecting spots that I would use during the winter lay-off.  <BR><BR>This particular spot, after logging, was strictly off limits, as it was part of the Fruit Grower Company''s land, and after logging they would lock up the roads. It didn&#8217;t matter how long you logged their property after a sale it was shut down, and you had to stay out!   Well, hunting season arrived, and I breached the locked gate, and snuck in there for a day of hunting.   I took along my ever-present companion, Pappy, my hunting cow dog.  Him and I were inseparable, because he didn&#8217;t know fear, and would attack a grizzly if you didn&#8217;t keep him under control.  He had a good nose, and located many a deer that got away from me. <BR><BR>Well, we got into the same area that I had spotted the droppings, and Pappy went on purple alert.  His fur went straight up and he acted totally weird.  He came to a halt and refused to go any further down the trail. I never saw him act quite this way!  Just 100 yards up the hill I spotted movement.  It was crouching down behind a buck-brush bush, and it just crouched there staring at us.  It was completely unnerving!  I realized I was illegally in that area, and this might be another hunter, or a DFG cop ready to bust my butt.  Note, guys were always getting busted for hunting on the California line or the Oregon line. It was just a bad spot, and it was so close to each border, it would be up to that game warded. <BR><BR>Well, I had a Remington rifle, in a 270 caliber, with a 3x9 scope, and not really wanting to aim a rifle at another hunter, I sort of swept the total area, like I was looking for deer.  What I saw chilled me to the bone!  It was not human, and that&#8217;s about all that I can really say!  To this day, it looked like a king sized Eddy Munster, and it didn&#8217;t look ape like, but it sure as hell wasn&#8217;t human.  The eyes, were what got my leg&#8217;s going, because I wasted no time getting back to my truck and getting out of there. <BR>",

    " I think the year was 83 or 84. That year there was a huge mudslide on the south (River) side of Highway 50. I remember because we had to turn around, go back up around Tahoe, and take Highway 80 back to the Bay Area. We were among the first to the slide area, and got out of our truck to look. It was early evening, and  I saw a huge, bi-pedal creature on the slide side of the river. It was on the Tahoe (east) side of the slide, as were we.  It was high on the hill, and appeared to also be regarding the slide. I saw it for about 15 seconds, when it ambled up the hill and out of sight. <BR><BR>I have seen many bear, and this was no bear. A bear might rear up, but aside from circus bears, none will walk that way for any length. Even circus bears have an ungainly walk when trying to go on 2 legs.

    " The sighting ocurred in the late seventies.<BR><BR>I was  with my dog at the North jetty, in Ft. Stevens State Park. It was a very stormy day and the surf was high, crashing over the rocks on the jetty and pounding the beach. From the viewing tower I saw a man-like figure walk down off the grassy area onto the beach.<BR>  <BR> At first I did not think too much of this \"person\" out on the sands. Then I watched as the figure neared the edge of the water. It was waving its arms up and down facing the surf and the tower.  There was another person on the tower with his daughter and they too saw the figure; we looked at each other with a \"what the hell is that\" look but said nothing and continued to watch this figure standing on the beach.<BR><BR>   At this point I noticed a pick up truck with its lights on approaching up the beach from the south. Then the scale of the figure really struck me; it had to be a good 8 feet tall or more. The figure quickly turned and moved very fast off the beach before the truck was in range.<BR><BR>It did not run but rather \"strode\" the 30 or so yards to the dunes edge, then took one or two steps up the embankment and was gone.<BR><BR>   I was all excited and scared on what I has just seen.  I decided to go to the nearest parking lot near where the figure came down on the beach and see if I could get another look at it. As I approached the beach I became even more afraid, the wind was so strong I could hear nothing but the roar of the surf and the howl of the wind through my coat''s hood.  My dog was anxious and stayed close to me.<BR><BR>   I went to the beach and found where it came down the sand hill, the sand was all torn up from its passage. But when I discovered the hill was an easy 10 foot high, I really became fearful and decided to return to my car and leave instead of following the tracks into the grass.<BR><BR>   The vivid picture of a sandy colored figure standing near the surf waving its arms still stays with me today nearly thirty years later.<BR>",

    " I was driving from Portland to Lincoln city to retrieve my work bag that I had left in Lincoln City over the weekend. I left Portland at 3 am and had only had coffee and donuts to eat; there were not many other cars on the road at all, none that were going in a westerly direction that were within sight of me and only about 2 cars passed me between Spirit Mountain Casino and the site were I had my sighting. I was driving about 55 mph and had my bright lights on  and had just came over a rise in the road shortly after you start down the back side of Murphy Hill summit. As I crested the rise out in the distance I saw what I thought at the time was a deer on the left shoulder of the road about 200 yards out from me.  I slowed down to 40 mph or so because I didn''t want it to jump in front of me or if there were other deer in the area I might spook them into the road. As I got within 75 yards the object began to move across the road from left to right, that is, when I saw that it was not a deer and I thought it might be a bear which I have seen cross a road before but this was way different. The object was hunched over slightly and was on two legs and cleared the road in about 4 steps. The best way to describe the color was dark brown to black and I would guess the hair to be 4 or 5 inches. The arms looked to come down to mid thigh area. I did not see the face except for there seemed to be a deer-like shine coming from the face area. The height was about 7ft + as it disappeared over the edge of the road to the right. I was about 50 yards away by this time. I was starting to feel pretty weird like this was something I had never seen. Hard to explain the feeling as I passed the spot where it went over the bank I tried to look over and see where it had gone. I was going about 25 mph now as I went about 20 yards past the spot and stopped I then reversed my car to the spot where I had seen it go over the bank. I stopped my car and left the engine running I had my window rolled down slightly for air flow as I was driving. When I stopped I could smell a musty type smell not real bad but strong enough to notice. I could hear some movement in the brush but not a lot because of the car noise and the fact that my window was only down 2 or three inches on the left side when the object was now on my right.  I had a really strong feeling that I was being watched; every hair on my body was rigid, I had goose bumps over my whole body I have them now as I write about this, not as bad but the chills. I decided then that it would be a really good time to leave so I drove off as fast as my Metro would go I made it to Lincoln City at 6 am and had about 10 cars pass me going east on hwy 18 in that time.When I got there I went to my girlfriend''s to get my bag and was going to come right back to Portland to work. Instead I stayed until 9 am then left to go back to Portland. As I drove by the spot I thought about stopping but decided against it.  I know the area well though because I helped a lady who had rolled her car off the road in the same are many years ago. The bank in the are is about 7 ft down on both sides and is swampy in some places. I lived in Lincoln City for many years and have spent time in the woods alone and with others and have never felt or seen anything like this  I dont know what to make of it except for it being Bigfoot. No bear walks on its back legs like this. If you want to see the spot I can take you there just let me know also I drive this stretch of road 2 times sometimes more a week.",

    "  I just wrote a long report then lost it by clicking on the \"why we need location\" line and could not get back to my report to submit it.<BR><BR>The report was recounted in detail to W.H.F. and his written report edited and amended by the witness.<BR>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>This sequence of events occurred in December 1978, a few days before Christmas. The location was at the edge of the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area near Cleawox Lake, about half a mile west of the Coast  Highway 101 across from the Jessie M. Honeyman Memorial State Park. The air was slightly hazy but brightly illuminated by a waning moon between full and third quarter.<BR><BR>The observer with her German Shepherd dog had been walking in the beautiful night, very warmly dressed, as was her habit. She had been standing quietly  on a high spot with trees in the ridged terrain covered with beach grass and intermittent impenetrable thickets, at about 1 AM, when she observed the silhouette of what she thought was a man approaching in her direction from the north about 400 yards away. This person was walking on an elevated ridge that projected him against the skyline, the north-south ridge oriented running past her to the west. Throughout the entire pacing sequence  she could see light through the legs. Not wanting to have an encounter at that hour with anybody, she retreated below the ridgeline and sat down in a concealed and dark hollow with her dog. As the person got closer at a brisk pace, the dog bolted towards it, barking and with its running start ran to the top of the ridge about 500 ahead of the figure. There the dog immediately made several yaiyeeee - yaiyeee distress calls and ran back to the observer, huddling close to her and shivering. It should be mentioned here, that the dog had lived in Alaska and had had encounters with moose, bear and other mammals and had never reacted in this manner. <BR><BR>The approaching individual seemingly took no notice of the dog, did not break stride or slow down but kept getting closer with its steady stride. At this stage, it made a left turn and walked directly toward the observer, she observed that the head and shoulders traveled without vertical motion, as if the individual were traveling on cross-country skis. She also observed a distinct sliding motion of the feet, which she believes was caused by a peculiar sideways swing of the foot and leg. It came to a stop about 150 from the observer. It should be added at this juncture that during the entire approach, the creature walked on the anterior half of the foot with a 5 pace, as ascertained by inspection on the next day.<BR><BR>It stopped in the exact place where the dog had turned around and faced in the direction the dog had run. The hooded observer shielded her face with her gloved hands and hood to be less visible. After several minutes with no motion on either side, the person got progressively smaller until only a lump remained visible. The observer contemplated whether the person was receding but decided that it was simply hunkering down and watching. After a while, in fact, the figure stood back up and seemed to hold both of its hands beside its head, perhaps cupping its ears to hear better in the prevailing brisk wind from its rear (from the west). It then started walking more slowly toward the observer, taking 3 steps (as verified later). During this approach it swayed dramatically from side to side. The observer now also noticed that the creature was evidently naked by its silhouetted legs clearly outlined up to its crotch. Its legs turned out in a peculiar manner during each step but each footfall was set exactly in line with the preceding foot, a detail verified later in daylight. At this juncture, she came to the inevitable conclusion that she was observing a non-human individual (Only to be positively confirmed when it subsequently ran). Intermittently, she noticed that the hair on the head and shoulders bristled and flared out. She could now estimate that its height was between 8 and 9. <BR><BR>During the walking and standing phase, light was always visible between its long legs which were rather slender in front view, but thicker when seen from the side. Upper and lower legs seemed of normal relative proportions, but longer than human proportions in reference to the upper body. In face-on view, the individual had a huge head and masssive shoulders, no visible neck, with a peak to the head and backpack-like hump on the shoulders, long arms with hands hanging clear of the torso to either side almost to the knees and a narrow waist. The hair on the peak of its head occasionally flared up and was additionally ruffled by the wind.<BR><BR> After some time, after the creature had held its hands again to its head (ears), it suddenly dropped low down and then launched itself with a powerful push-off off the side of the ridge, about 10'' high, into an instant high-speed run, in which it covered 95 to concealment in three 30 steps, with the legs straight out in front and back, giving the impression of a different hip articulation than that of man. [The human record for the corresponding effort, the triple jump, is just over 60] To this point about 30 minutes had elapsed.<BR><BR>The creature appeared to run at an angle toward the observer rather than away, perhaps to circle to the downwind side. The dog was shivering violently at this time, when the observer decided to show herself on top of the ridge behind her, where she stood for a moment waving her walking stick demonstratively in the air, while the dog pressed against her legs. Then she forced herself to walk, fighting the inclination to run, the half mile or so back to the parking lot and her car, where she and her dog sat with open windows. The dog would intermittently look in one direction or the other and woof slightly. At this point the hidden creature let out two intense, loud and powerful screams, a sound paralyzing in its intensity and beyond comparison to anything else. Thereafter, it appeared to be gone and the dog fell asleep.<BR><BR>The next morning the observer surveyed the scene of the previous night and made additional observations. The approach of the creature along the ridge top was shown by half footprints, 8-9 wide, with a step length of about 54, in a straight line without stradle. The width of the foot would indicate a foot length of between 18 and 20, in turn commensurate with a height above 8, in congruence with the observers estimate. The uniform walking on the front part of the foot suggests that the animal was using a stealth walking, undoubtedly having detected the observer early on as she had seen its approach. The footprints were not particularly deeply imprinted, in keeping with the rather slender-waisted and thin-legged appearance observed during the night. ",

    " I had lived in Indiana for a few years and had returned to Oregon in 2005. I was so excited to be back home; even the air smells sweeter when I got back. I would get in my car and just drive sometimes. One day, winter of 2006, my daughter and I drove up to the Oregon Caves and then meandered back towards Redwood Highway. I decided to stop at a park on the outskirts of Cave Junction to smoke and stretch my legs. It was winter and nobody else was in the park, very quiet and cold. We walked down to the river, randomly talking about how pretty it was. Out of the corner of my right eye I saw someone walking in the river. My first thought was of concern because it was so cold and I could not imagine anyone being in the river except if there were an emergency. I turned my head and all I remember seeing was a very large dark person (It walked like a human). I don''t remember much after that except sheer panic. My hair was standing on end and I yelled at my daughter to \"RUN\"!!! I didn''t even look back to make sure my daughter was behind me, I figured I could hear her footsteps and that was good enough. All I could think about was whatever that thing was, it wouldn''t take long for it to catch up to us before we made it to the car. Once we were in the car I don''t even recall how fast we got back to the highway. I stopped in a parking lot once we were in Cave Junction and tried to calm down. We hadn''t even spoken to each other until then. My daughter finally asked me, \"Mom, what was that?\" I told her that I had no idea, maybe it was a bear. Her reply was that it didn''t look or walk like a bear and it was too big to be a bear. I agreed with her but I didn''t have any other answer at that time. I honestly cannot recall a time when I have been that panicked especially considering that there really was no reason to panic. This thing was far enough down river that I could not make out details of its face and it was just \"strolling\" through the water. It was not making threatening movements at all. I had pretty much convinced myself it had to have been a bear and forgot about the incident until recently when I saw a bear while hiking. I have seen bears in the past but this bear was quite close and it didn''t really bother me. I just turned around and walked back the way I came in. It occurred to me as odd that being alone, seeing a bear ahead of me (with my car quite far away) I felt no panic and very little fear. I couldn''t understand my fear of whatever was walking in the river. It was much farther away than this bear had been, my car was much closer and I was not alone...I was in a public park not far at all from Cave Junction, I mean it really bothered me.<BR>",

    " I just found your site and do not remember all the details of my sighting but here is the best I can remember of the night I saw something on Cabbage Hill in Oregon;<BR>It was December of 1985, right around Christmas. I was driving a truck and trailer going back to Texas from Portland, OR. <BR>My co-driver was asleep when I saw it cross the highway (I-84) on top of Cabbage Hill at about 1:30 a.m. I came around a small curve and it looked as surprised as I was. I stopped with it in my headlights and it stopped right in front of me as I almost hit it (about 2 feet from it) and sat and watched it stare at me through the windshield.<BR>I was driving a 1984 Peterbilt, long-nosed tractor, which as I recall the top of the hood is about 6 1/2 ft from the ground to the top. This creature was head and shoulders above the top of the hood as it looked at me look back.<BR>It was blondish-brown in color, had bright yellowish-red eyes and was not as mean looking as some have told in the TV shows that try to scare you about it.<BR>It had some hair but was not as hairy as a bear. I thought at first, it might be a bear that has been losing its hair. It had very human-like features, like a nose that seemed to me as large but human-like. It''s mouth was formed like a human''s but its teeth were a bit longer but not like fangs. It''s belly button was long and deep, it had an inny.<BR>It walked like an old man with a back ache, kind of bent slightly forward and stiff. Its arms were longer than a man''s but it didn''t look like a gorilla with arms too long for its body.<BR>I remember thinking to myself that this must be some sort of mutant bear or something.<BR>It seemed mad that I was invading its space, it straightened upright and slapped the top of the hood right above the radiator with open hands like it was warning me to leave it alone.<BR>I woke my co-driver but he only saw it as it ran into the woods away from the highway where I sat wishing I had a camera to take a picture to show everyone this thing I had seen. <BR>I often looked for it the next few years as I drove through this area but never again saw it or anything like it. I would love to know if this creature has been seen by any other drivers that would be willing to have a composite drawing done to see if we could identify it better.",

    " Christmas Day, 1986. Fifteen years old at the time, I was staying at my uncle''s house near Kent, WA. At the rear of the house is a forested area. Around 7 or 8 am on Dec.25, 1986, we were all leaving to visit other relatives and I realized that I had left something inside the house, so went around to the rear entrance and was fumbling at the lock when I heard a tremendous crashing coming towards me through the forest. The oddest thing about the entire incident was my reactions - completely different to what one would expect. Hearing the crashing coming towards me I didn''t (as you would expect someone to do) turn around to see what was happening - I felt a tremendous feeling of dread which certainly didn''t help my efforts at unlocking the door. Whatever it was that was coming through the forest was making a LOT of noise and sounded BIG. The noise came closer until it was just approximately 30 metres behind me just inside the woodline and to my left, at which point I very slowly turned around (again it is impossible to convey just how frightened I felt) and I saw a creature standing upright and looking at me. It was tall and bulky but definitely not a  bear standing upright because it didn''t have the sloping shoulders of a bear but rather looked like a tall, bulky person in a cheap ape suit. I was genuinely paralyzed with fear and could neither make movement nor sound. The hair or fur was dark brown/black/reddish tints but mostly dark from what I could see. It was, as I mentioned, standing just inside the treeline, so the lower legs were hidden from view - only from about midthigh upwards was visible and definitely looked humanlike but with a pointier head than a normal human. I had the feeling that the exchange of looks lasted quite long but probably only lasted a few seconds before I was finally able to move, at which point I raced back round the front of the house and jumped into the car with the rest of the family, who remarked that I looked like I had seen a ghost. I never told anyone about what I had seen because growing up in the Pacific Northwest, one learns to laugh at the nutcases who claim to have seen bigfoot, and I certainly participated in the ridicule until that day. I only ever went to my uncle''s house one other time after that day and sometimes now wish I had been brave enough to have looked in the forest for footprints later but it was simply impossible to have done at the time.",

    " I was driving a truck while hauling a dozer on a trailer.  My task was to deliver the dozer to a logging site.  It was early morning and I''d driven east out of North Bend, WA along the Middle Fork of the Snoqualmie River on SE Middle Fork Road which turns into NFD 5060 Road east of Mt. Si.  I then took a logging road on my way to the drop off site.  <BR><BR>As I drove down the logging road, up ahead along the side of the road I saw two tall people walking in the direction I was heading.  My first reaction was that they were really tall and must be basketball players.  As I got closer, it looked like they were wearing dark colored full body wetsuits with hoods.  I tried to make sense of what I was seeing and thought maybe they were bow hunters wearing a special suit.  As I drove closer I could see that they both had unusually long arms and that one had a more female shape and stood about 7 feet tall compared to the other which had a male shape and stood about 8 feet tall.  <BR><BR>The subjects then reacted to my approach by stopping and turning around toward me and stood in the middle of the road in a slightly crouched position.  They seemed agitated and with their feet stationary they turned and looked at both sides of the road by rotated their upper bodies at the waste back and forth, back and forth while swinging their arms at their sides.  When they did this, they looked very ape like.  <BR><BR>As I closed to about 35-40 yards away, the female jumped and ran off the left side of the road toward the river and disappeared into the brush.  The male stayed in the road a little longer shuffling to the left side of the road.  Finally, as I got even closer, in one step from the edge of the road he jumped a distance of around 20 feet and easily cleared what I now could see was a thicket of thorny blackberry vines at least 8 feet tall, and he was gone.    <BR><BR>They were both dark brown in color from head to toe.  Their faces were dark brown also.  I didn''t really notice if they had fur or hair.  Perhaps the fur or hair was wet and matted down from the rain.  I didn''t notice any odor or sounds. <BR><BR>I continued to the drop off site 1-2 miles further down the road and began to unload the dozer.  Another driver who was less than a minute or so behind me on the same road arrived.  After unloading and somewhat composing myself, I asked the other driver if he''d seen anything strange along the logging road on his way in.  He said he had not.  I then left the drop off site and stopped at the encounter location.  I looked around but did not find any large tracks in the thin layer of snow along the side of the road.  There was no snow on the dirt/gravel logging road itself.  I didn''t want to battle the blackberry vines to follow the creatures'' escape route into the forest, so I took off.<BR><BR>The only explanation I have for what I saw is that the creatures must have been sasquatches.  Because no human could be that big and jump like that and I know they weren''t bears.  <BR><BR><BR>        ",

    " Driving up road, we hit snow. In a clearing we noticed lots of tracks of wildlife then some large foot prints on left side of road. We investigated the prints. It was definitely bare foot prints coming down the side of the road then turning up into the woods. The feet were 18\" long. A large heel and tows were visible. We turned the truck around, parked near the prints, and started a fire. My friend, Rob knocked two logs together three times then repeated this twice. Within 10 minutes at around 11:45 we heard a bark from a distance. 5 - 10 minutes later I heard the sound of a person whistling for a dog but there were no cars around that we could see nor were there any on the way up to our location. Immediately after the whistle, I heard more whistling in the same direction but from multiple sources. The whistling began to sound like small birds or birds chirping. Rob and I contemplated what kind of a bird would be in the mountains chirping at midnight in the middle of winter. We figured there are none. At about 12:15 I heard some fast paced foot steps beyond our field of vision. We viewed the area with our flashlights and I didn''t see anything. Rob told me on the drive out of there that he saw something cross the road while we heard the footsteps. The footsteps sounded bipedal. Then Rob heard a branch brake behind him behind a pile of logs. I asked if he''d like to leave because I was feeling like we were being approached by something big and I couldn''t see it. Rob later commented that it was as if we were being hunted. We headed out at about 12:30 feeling that we were leaving just in time before whatever it was got too close.",

    " Mr. Becker said on the 29th he had taken his kids sledding up on Green Mt. He drives a GMC 4-wheel drive TK, so they decided to take the Green Mtn. Rd. up toward 3 Fingers Mtn. After driving for a few miles they stopped and tied the sled on the back of the TK. Several times the sled would tip over and they would stop while his son put it back on the road. When Mr. Becker asked him to put it in the middle he said there was a pile of droppings there. Mr. Becker took a look and noticed that the droppings were from a wild animal, but did not think anything of it until later. They began pulling the sled up the road again.<BR><BR>On the next stop they noticed a trail of large footprints going up the bank. They went over for a closer look and discovered that they were just like human''s bare footprints with 5 toes. It suddenly came to Mr. Becker that this could be the legendary ''bigfoot'' that he had read about on several occasions.<BR><BR>He kept the kids back so as not to disturb the tracks. He then put his foot in one of the tracks for comparison. He had on a pair of heavy snow boots and there was an inch difference on each side and 2 or 3 inches at the front and back. He spread his legs out next to the tracks to compare the stride. He said he practically had to do the splits to match the stride: which would be about 4 to 5 feet between steps. A couple of prints were pushed all the way to the ground under the snow. With his weight, even jumping up and down, he could not sink half that far. He thought of the pile of droppings and figured it could have come from what ever made the tracks. He thought the tracks were from 1 to 2 days old at the most.<BR><BR>It was getting late in the afternoon and starting to drizzle so he decided to take the kids home and come back another day and get some pictures and possibly follow the tracks to see where they led.<BR><BR>After thinking about it the next day he decided to call the Sheriff''s office and report it. This is where Jerry Phillips comes in... he worked with the Sheriff.",

    " This happened on a day outing with a good friend and hunting partner of mine. It was around 9:00 am or so that my friend called me to see if I was doing anything. I was not, he told me he wanted to go up to the mountains for the day and do something and asked if I would like to go. I did so I got my stuff ready while he was on his way over to pick me up; all I grabbed was my boots and a .22 pistol, which was also what he was bringing (a .22 pistol). Anyway, on our way from my house, since we really didn''t have any set plans on where we were going, I suggested that we go up to this rancher''s place that we often hunted so we could look for antler drop offs while we walked along plinking with our pistols. <BR><BR>We pulled up to the rancher''s house but no one was home to tell we were going up on the hill, so we drove past his 400 acres to the next place, a 200 acre unoccupied place that we also had ongoing permission to hunt etc. So we began there at the east end of that place and worked our way through the woods all the way back to the first place. We decided to go ahead up the hill through this place where a trail starts and runs about 1/3 of the way up the side of the hill, the entire length of the ridge, and eventually comes out about 3 1/2 miles later on a logging road above Elbe. Our plan was to hit the logging road and walk down the road to the r/r tracks and follow them back to the truck. <BR><BR>We, however, realized as we plinked that about 1/2 way along this trail that we would not have enough time left before dark to make it all the way to the logging road before dark let alone all the way back to the truck from there. But we knew if we cut straight down the mountain right where we were that we would make it to the valley below before dark. So we got started down through the heavy second growth and after about 45 min of fighting our way a long ways through thick tangling ferns and underbrush, we finally came out to a small group of clear cuts on the hill above another ranch. This was bad because these people never let anyone trespass on their land.<BR><BR>But since we didn''t have any other choice to get off the mountain before dark and since it was almost dark now we decided to go down the logging road very quietly as not to get caught on their land (this small road system is their own private operation and none of these roads go far or are connected to any other roads) to the valley below. As we quietly proceeded down this road we were half way through the last small clear-cut, it was just about dark, you could still see in the clear-cut and a long ways down the road, but not at all past the timber''s edge. <BR><BR>We were walking side by side; I was on the left, when I saw something out of place ahead and on the left. I immediately thought that it looked like a bigfoot standing there. We were about 100 yards away on the road from being straight across from it. I hadn''t said anything yet, we just kept walking, angling closer as the road came closer to its location until we were straight across from it, about 80 yards away. <BR><BR>The whole time I had not taken my eyes off it as we walked and I hadn''t said anything yet because I thought it was going to turn out to be a stump or something (like when you see a burnt stump and it looks like a bear or something). That''s when I stopped; I realized it was not a stump, I could see its arms, legs, and even some detail of it face. My friend stopped when I did. I was going to point this out to him, however when I stopped and looked at him he was already looking at it himself and said, and I quote, \"it can''t be!\" We both just stood there for a minute, then my friend bends over, picks up a rock and throws it at it. He did think it must have been a stump until then. As soon as the rock landed this (and its still hard to say) bigfoot did not jump or run or seem scared at all, it just turned towards the dark timber behind it and walked into the forest. <BR><BR>Please note that I am an avid hunter. I have hunted and harvested many animals including bears on this very hill. I''ve hunted from Alaska to Montana. I''ve taken many bears, even some at close range with my bow. I am very aware what all the animals look like and I am 100% sure this was a bigfoot. <BR><BR>Before this, even with all the hunting and hiking that I have done, I never came across any tracks or other sign that I could not identify as normal forest animals, so up until this I thought that is was just a myth. Also, this is important as to the exact date, which I''m sorry I can''t remember, but about a week later on our local news someone found tracks down by the river in this area. If that information could be found you would have a close date. The news said something like this: \"Bigfoot tracks found crossing the Nisqually River near Mt Rainer,\" and they showed photos of the spot but did not say exactly where, but by the size of the river in the photos they showed it looked very close to where we were.<BR>",

    " My name is Tim. My wife Nan and I live between Newberg and Wilsonville, OR. On February 24, 2016 we decided to take a couple of days off and drive up to the Olympic Peninsula. We drove up to Olympia, WA and took Hwy 101 route along the Hood Canal to through Port Angeles to Forks, where we stayed the night at the Forks Motel.<BR><BR>Early on the morning of February 25th (a Thursday) we drove south on Hwy 101 to Upper Hoh Road and east to the Hoh Rain Forest. It was a beautiful clear and dry day, which was unusual for February on the Peninsula. After an enjoyable walk through the Rain Forest we headed back west on Upper Hoh Road. There was very little traffic in either direction and we pretty much had the road to ourselves. Approximately halfway back to Hwy 101, where the road once again comes close to the Hoh River, we had just cleared a corner and were at the beginning of a straight stretch of road which I estimate to be about 1/4-mile long before there was a left-hand corner.<BR><BR>At the end of that straight stretch we both saw a very large bipedal creature walk out of the woods on the north side of the road, stride across the road in three strides, and disappear into the woods on the south side of the road. It appeared to be 7-8'' tall and covered in dark hair. We both looked at each other in astonishment with that \"Did you see what I just saw?\" look on our faces. Without making comment of my own I asked Nan to describe what she had just seen, and her description was exactly the same as mine. When we got to that spot where we had seen the creature appear from the woods we stopped and examined the site. The road was in an area that was still within the Olympic National Forest, and the woods were so thick on each side of the road that it was difficult to see more than a few feet into the woods to the north. The trees were just as thick on the south side of the road, but we could tell that we were very close to the Hoh River. There was no trail whatsoever coming out of the woods or going into the woods on the south side of the road.<BR><BR>Under the circumstances we could only surmise that we had just seen a Bigfoot that was apparently going across the road to reach the river. Even though I never doubted the existence of Bigfoot, I always considered myself a \"Professional Skeptic\". Yes it most certainly could exist, especially here in the Pacific Northwest where there are still enormous tracts of land that are virtually unexplored, but I would prefer to see proof of it myself prior to confirmation.<BR><BR>I am now a confirmed believer, as is Nan. We never told anyone about it, and it wasn''t until last night when we were watching a rerun of your show where you did an investigation in the Olympic Rainforest that we were reminded of the event. After the show we decided that I should send an email to you to apprise you of our sighting.<BR>",

He has studied Sasquatch for the last 30 years. <BR><BR>We drove up Windy Ridge RD from the town Randle all the way to the top overlooking Spirit Lake , The weather was really bad it was raining and sleeting on and off and very foggy and windy.

But then from the backseat my uncle said that the scream from my brother had spooked something  down in the meadow and it was bolting around a hill in the middle of valley going from left to right and out of sight around a small hill about 400 yds. away he discribed it as large, black and walking upright.  My uncle was too scared to get out of the car, he said  \"us\" brothers should \"go and have a look\" up the road to see if we could get a better vantage point. The three of us proceeded to walk up the gated road ( FSRD 2560) leading up a ridge with some smaller knolls that ring the meadow.  It took us the most of 25 minutes up and down  the road and ten minutes scanning the meadow. My brothers and I didn''t see it walking off from the vantage point where we where.  So we headed  back to the car. <BR>My Uncle Mac was in the car the whole time watching the area where he had spotted it the first time when we left up the road.  He said that after the three of us rounded the hill and where out of sight the large sasquatch walked back into his view left to right and proceeded back to where it was before, walking by a small black stump when that stump then stood up and walked off with it leading what must have been young in the opposite direction the three of us where going. He said he lost sight of it as they walked north down deeper into Bear Meadow. <BR> We all loaded into the car and drove a little down the mountain ( 1/2 miles) to the Miner''s Car at a parking lot that is near the southern side of Bismark Mtn.  Clearwater Creek runs out of Meta Lake and under Windy River Rd. and into Bear Meadow at the Miner''s Car.  My uncle and my brothers spread out along the road to see if they could tell where these things where crossing the road.  I walked down the creekbed from the road into a slight gulley and followed it for about 100 yrds on the left side staying near the lowest point  along a game trail when I came up on a broken tree that had been broken for at least a year( Brown needles at the top).  I found a large humanoid footprint on a slope next to the tree. The toes where very noticable (no claws) and where imprinted in mud.  I went back to the car to get plaster and the consultation of my older brother who went to WSU and studied under Dr. Krantz.  I showed him the print before we poured the cast,  he agreed with me that it must be a bigfoot print .  I reminded him that we where in the blast area and no one normally walks in this restricted area on the side of a volcano barefoot .   It was really cold and raining so we gathered half shells of bark and covered the cast so it would set up overnight .  I went back the next day and retrieved the cast.<BR>I  have the cast and would like to compare it to others from this same area",

    " I used to live in Suquamish, WA. during 1994-2002. My house was located at the top of center street in the middle of the suquamish tree farm. My family and I during those years of residency had seen and heard quite a few times what we believed to be sasquatch. <BR><BR>The first time I saw one was in early 1995, and I was 8 years old at the time. It was a fairly chilly overcast winter day. We had few neighbors at the time and there was noone outside, so it was very peaceful. My mom had instructed me to pick up some cans from the backyard alone. The backyard was connected to the woods. I was at the edge of the woods and started heading back towards the house when I heard something very large running in the woods about 20 feet away. I quickly turned around to look and I saw what I thought was a bear at first, but it was running on two feet and it stopped quickly as it saw that I turned around. When it stopped, it stood straight up (on two feet like a man), and held its arms and hands close to its side. Ferns were covering parts of its legs. It was about 10 feet from any trees. I got the impression that it was hoping that I didn''t see it. As it stood still there, I stared at it for several seconds trying to figure out what it was. It was about 6''5\". <BR>It was very muscular, and very hairy except for I did not see hair on the face and on the fingers. Its fur was a dark brown color. <BR><BR>To be honest I cannot remember exactly what the skin color was, but I think it was light tan. Its eyes were directed toward me. The facial features were very similar to human features. I remember them being a lot more human than ape-like. Its face was not course and scary! I stared at it for about 10-15 seconds until I finally figured out what it was, and then I bolted back to the house as fast as I could. <BR><BR>There was a few more occasions that I have seen a Sasquatch, as well as my mother and my brother. We not only had sightings but almost every night we heard branches being broken in the woods and being hit in patterns, hollars and/or \"woo woo\" vocalizations coming from deep in the woods or close to the edge of the woods near our house. We often heard the \"woo woo\" sound between 2 or 3 sasquatches (I believe). <BR><BR>My brother and I had gone out in the woods a lot trying to recreate the \"woo woo\" vocalizations and we would hit sticks on trees in patterns. I can only remember two ocasions that we actually got a response. The first time was when we were in the woods at the edge of our property, and we were beating a stick on a tree in a pattern of 4 strikes each. After doing this for about 20 minutes not very far away from us we heard a very large tree branch being broken off of a tree following by 4 loud strikes on a tree. It responded in with 4 strikes a few times and then it stopped. The other time was when my brother and I were in the yard at about 9 o''clock at night, and it was very dark. Jokingly to my brother I did the \"woo woo\" vocalization, not expecting a response, but about 3 seconds later near the edge of the woods that were infront of our house we heard a  loud and somewhat dragged on \"woo\" .    <BR><BR>",

    " I was driving home in January of 1995 from Aberdeen, Washington to Westport, at around 9:00pm on State Hwy 105.  It was dark, foggy and kind of misty.  I was approx. one mile from the Stafford Creek Correctional Facility, on a long straight uphill  stretch of the road.  The lights of the prison turnoff were backlighting the crest of the hill.  There were no other cars of the road.  The road is a two lane road, with wide shoulders that could easily be additional lane width, so in essence the road is 4 lanes wide. I could easily see the road due to the backlighting and my headlights and foglights on my car.<BR>\tWhen I was about half way the hill, a figure stepped onto to the road from the bank, moving from the south to the north.  The north would lead to the harbor.  This figure was quite large, larger than any man that I have ever seen.  He had a large rounded head shape, long arms that reached well below his waist line.  His strides were huge.  He swung his arms opposite of the feet he was moving.  He cleared the roadway in 2 strides, and moved into the brush on the bayside of the road.  I could not make out any physical details or features of this figure other than the ones I have described. I could and still do each time I go past this location, look to see if the animal path that he was following is still there, and it is.<BR>\tFor a long time I kept quite about this.  I am not who likes to be in the public eye.  But now that I have shared this with some friends, they encouraged me to report this sighting.<BR>",

    " Witness'' Report: As told to Scott Taylor and Rayn Moonflower. The witness does not own a computer.<BR><BR>I had been helping some neighbors with a repair, and since I dont drive anymore, they took me home. It was about 2:00PM on Dec 26th 2012. The car had several people in it when they dropped me off. I was up on my porch, getting my keys out to open the front door when I heard screaming coming from the car which was still in the driveway. Wondering what they were arguing about, I turned to look at them, and saw that they were frantic, pointing to the back of my yard. I turned to look at what they were pointing at, when I saw a very large, hairy, upright form crossing a little cut in the brush at the back of my lot. There were three deer with it, two in front and one behind. That seemed strange. The deer were unconcerned. We have a huge population of deer here. I knew immediately what it was.a bigfoot. I noted a tree limb that was even with its head. One step and it was gone. I went out there and marked the limb where its head was with a piece of white rag. <BR><BR>The next week, on January 3rd around 2:30PM, I was out at the back of my property with my loppers. I was cutting a trail through the very thick brush so that I could get to the next street easier. There are narrow deer trails and I was on one of those. I smelled something really bad. It was like a ripe garbage can. I made my way in that direction, clipping branches, when suddenly I saw something on the ground in about 6-8 feet in front of me. At first, I couldnt see what it was, and then it moved. I was frozen in fear. I am on oxygen, and knew I could not run. This thing arose to hands and knees. It was hairy and brown, with silver gray hair on its back. It reminded me of a giant pile of steel wool. I thought it was a bear at first. It was supporting itself on its right hand and knees. The left hand was off the ground. It turned its head and upper body to look left and looked at me. My fear level was a 10! I dropped my loppers without moving. He then looked away from me, shifting his weight to his left hand. He brought his right hand up in front of him and rubbed his thumb on his fingers while he looked right, then forward as if he were reasoning out which way to go. Then he looked back at me, but his expression changed, and my fear level dropped. He looked intelligent. After a few seconds of considering what to do, he took off in the direction he was facing, straight ahead. On all fours he slithered along the ground, going under limbs and up a little rise for about 15 feet. Then I saw him stand up momentarily, and then duck down and dart away to the right. It was at that moment that I decided to run, to heck with the consequences. I made it back to my yard and about halfway to the house when I collapsed. After resting, getting my breath, and collecting my wits, I went back there. I found what I think is a hand print, and placed a bucket over it to preserve it.<BR><BR>After thinking things over, the next evening, I called the police. Two officers were there within minutes. They arrived around 6:30PM. They were very re-assuring. They said to not worry, and to just tell them what happened, as they see strange things all the time. I told them what happened. They stayed with me for a couple of hours. They did not make fun of me and were supportive and re-assuring.<BR><BR>I dont own a computer, and dont even know how to turn one on. I started asking around for some friends in real-estate to look for some organization to report this to. Eventually, someone found your number and gave it to me. I thought it was a Montana phone number. I called an left a message.<BR>",

I got up, went to see.<BR><BR>I didn''t see anything around the truck, but did see reflections of three sets of eyes just in front of the house about 50''.

I did this because there was a tree next to them and some branches were present during the observation.

    " I was driving down Williard Rd around 5pm as i came around the last right hand corner looking toward the straight away to the junction with cook- underwood road.   i saw a black object in the road....i thought its was a bear and the largest bear i have ever seen...it took up the whole left lane of the road...and it was huge...it looked like the butt was raised up...i .figured it could be a 6 hundred lb bear ( in my mind)...then i saw this commotion going on like something moving up and down.....all black ...a bear will run or lumber across the road.....at the time i thought i have never seen a bear do this...i thought this could be several deer or elk walking in the road......i was confused about all of the motion going on....then as it approached the creature and the creature approached the edge of the bank...it popped up...i yelled out its a man! what is a man doing out here in the woods this time of nite...it stepped onto the bank and walked into the woods...as my mind was trying to figure out what i saw....i saw the whole body and the head ... the right leg stepped onto the bank ... left arm back...no hat no coat no clothes, there was no snout or ears like a bear...yes a conical head, tall, arms longer...legs bulky...my headlights lit it up....by the time i passed it it had disappeared into the woods and by the time i reached cook-underwood road about 600 feet...i knew what i saw but was still trying to process it...i went back on sunday to see if i could see prints but it had rained hard all nite and i saw no prints...i still see the creature in my mind....<BR><BR>later  as my mind was processing what i saw i  knew it had to be  arms and legs going up and down as it crossed the road and also it was actually crawling....then stood up by the bank but it was so fast it like popped up.....still hard for me to believe what i saw but i believe it was a Sasquatch...i also now believe as i approached it when my headlights came upon it...it turned back towards the headlights and scrunched its face because the headlights were in its eyes.. then turned and faced into the woods and walked off..",

    " We (myself and husband John) met with Don Cox the latter part of March, 1969. He had read the article in the newspaper about the footprints we had found, and called to see if we could get together. We agreed, and met him at a designated place, and proceeded to go to Bear Creek where we had seen the footprints. It was his, and our intent to explore each others experience. He was riding in our car, and when we got to Beacon Rock, he said to slow down. The place where he saw Bigfoot was not too far ahead. He related the following: <BR><BR>He was going fishing at Bonnevile Dam shortly before 4 a.m., Wednesday, March 5. It was foggy, and when he emerged from a patch of fog, just a short distance East of Beacon Rock, his headlights caught something strange in the road in front of him. At first, he thought it was a tree which had blown over the highway...but it was moving across the road. He slowed down,and then realized it was no tree....but a large, fur clad creature crossing the road. He watched as this huge creature continued across the road, and then with one leap, cleared the embankment (14'' high) on the other side of the road. He was so \"shook-up\" he had to stop at Jerry''s Cafe in North Bonneville for coffee, and was there encouraged to report the incident. He said the \"animal\" was definitely not a bear. He reported all of this to the Skamania County Sheriff. <BR><BR>When we got to the spot where Don had seen whatever he had seen, we parked the car, got out, and Don explained exactly what he had seen (again),and showed us the 14'' high embankment which the creature had jumped with such great ease. <BR><BR>During Don''s recounting of his experience, he was still visibly shaken. I had the feeling he just wanted to tell us about this, and get out of there.<BR><BR><img src=\"http://www.bfro.net/flatsfiles/1621a.png\">",

    " I was about 13 and lived in Southern Washington in a small town called Amboy. I lived with my mother stepfather and stepbrother in a small house on about 5 acres pretty far from anyone, on Rotschy Hill.<BR>One day my brother and I were building a fort in the woods on the base of an small hill just on the outside of our property. On top of the hill there was a house that you couldn''t see from where we were.<BR>So we were working on our fort when we heard a lot of noise on the side of the hill branches breaking, dogs barking - it was very loud and I looked over approx. 250-300 yrds from where we were.<BR>I actually first saw the dogs and noticed what they were running after what seemed to be like a gorilla. I say that because of the arms. It was running on the side of the hill, taking large steps, kind of striding on two legs. It seemed to be scared of the dogs. There were 3 dogs running down the hillside about 50 yrds behind it at first. At that point I was sort of in shock and trying to get my brother to see it, too, but from where he was he couldn''t see it.<BR>From that point on I got really excited to tell my mom and my uncle who also claims to have seen it around Mt. St. Helens awhile back. Of course, nobody really believes me except my brother, so I don''t really tell the story now that im 23 and I understand the skepticism that surrounds this subject.

    " Me and a friend were 4-wheeling in the Cascade range in the early 80s. It was near the sno-pac, slightly east of Snoqualmie Pass. We had been driving most of the day, always taking whichever path went \"up\". Around midnight or so, it started to snow lightly even though there were small blowing clouds and huge patches of night sky i.e. moon and stars. At this time I was behind the wheel of my friends big truck, and was concerned about the snow fall. We were riding along a narrow road with a huge drop-off on one side. My friend told me to keep my foot into it or we may slide off! He said there is always a place to turn around at the top of these roads. After turning around, we proceeded back down. The road went straight with a 90'' type turn to the right towards the end of the incline we were coming down. To our left going down was a upward sloping bank or hill (actually the top crest of cascades) and as we turned right, a hill or upward slope on our left. As we approached at a slow rate of speed I saw what I first thought to be 3 hunters. Then I decieded it was hunter who was trying to hide behind a scrawny bush and I thought he was releiving (urinate) himself and was embarrased that we drove up. I also thought he was wearing some type of snow/winter jump suit. All of these thoughts ocurred in a flash or split second. In the next instance, we grabbed each other and said (both stuttering) \"DDDid You See That!!!\" both at the same time. It was definetly a Big Foot. Here is my description: Its face was non-descript and sunk on the shoulders with no neck. The shoulders were wide and the crotch was very high. The legs were long. It looked at us, crouched down and tried to hide behind the small shrub and then took off to the left with huge strides up the slope and out of sight. We drove to North Bend and had coffee And tried to settle down. An old man told \"He would give his eye teeth to see what we had\". With that encouragement we fueled up and went back to look for tracks. We had to drive all the way to the top again to get our bearing, so we would recognise the turn. We stopped my friend got out and went to the spot, as directed by me and the truck headlights as I wouldn''t get out of the truck. He panicked, jumped in and we left.",

She described the \"thing\" to have been about 3-4 feet above the bottom of the window. When I went down to look behind the house this morning, I stood by the window. I am 5''4\" and my eyes just reach the bottom of the window, so I figure this \"thing\" must have been 7-8 feet tall. We live in a small village of less than 500 population.  There are a lot of bushes and trees in between the houses. Their house is close to the beach, and there is forest surrounding the town. Now, I''ve never known my daughter to afraid of anything, but last night when I went to pick her up, she was shaking like a leaf, she was hysterical, it took me almost an hour to calm her down. I questioned her about what happened. She called me about 5 minutes after she first saw it.  She was too scared to move. When I got down there, I would not look behind the house, but she was hiding in my relative''s closet. She said it was walking back and forth right behind the house. She described the footsteps as a sound that someone very large walking on two feet, kind of like a \"stomping\". My daughter is very down-to-earth, not one prone to dramatics.

    " On approximately December of 1982, two friends and myself were returning to Colorado from Texas, by car. At just before midnight, on a dark stretch of Interstate 25, heading North towards Denver (just 100 some miles before Colorado Springs,CO.) something strange caught my eye. I was seated in the passenger side of the car. A friend, Trent, was driving. In the backseat, asleep and extremely ill, was another friend. <BR><BR>To the right, traveling at 60 MPH, the headlights caught what appeared to be a 3-4 foot, white haired ape-like creature, with a dark face. It was standing upright. My eyes caught it some 100 feet ahead in the lights, and I followed it with my eyes. It was merely standing there at the side of the road. <BR><BR>Although I admit a childhood interest in BIGFOOT lore, I almost instantly dismissed it as such a creature. Surely my eyes were playing tricks on me. I said nothing to my friend, who was driving. My first instinct was to ask my friend to turn around and go back to investigate. Instead, I said nothing. <BR><BR>Five minutes later, my friend pulled off to the side of the road, as he had to \"relieve\" himself. We met at the back of the car to \"take care of business\", where he expressed he was getting tired. I agreed, telling him, I, too, was tired, and was starting to \"see things\". He then told me, that he was also \"seeing things\", saying, \"Yeah, I just thought I saw a Polar Bear back there.\" <BR><BR>A chill went up my spine, and I asked him if it was \"white and furry\". He said yes. I told him that I thought I saw a \"small white ape, with a dark face!\" Without missing a beat, he told me to get in the car. \"Let''s get out of here!\" <BR><BR>We wanted to go back to investigate, but our sick friend in the backseat needed to get home, due to his illness. He was passed out throughout the entire episode, and we didn''t want to pester him with our shared \"illusion\". <BR><BR>We''re obviously unsure of what we saw. However, we agreed that it was not a coyote, and we both only saw two legs. <BR><BR>This account was dismissed by us, until 5 years later, when \"Unsolved Mysteries\" did a feature on some unusual sightings of a large Bigfoot like creature. Their report: Along the Colorado Front range, there had been reports of a WHITE haired APE-LIKE CREATURE, roaming around the homes in the foothills just NORTH of Colorado Springs. (Our sighting was 100 some mile SOUTH). I think it important to mention, for credibility, that I have held a strong fascination in Bigfoot lore since childhood. I am not totally convinced that what I saw was what I know as a Bigfoot. The account is true, however, I believe the circumstances of the event and the accounts in that region are interesting and worth reporting here. I have never told of this event to more than a half-dozen people. <BR><BR>I think it important to mention, for credibility, that I have held a strong fascination in Bigfoot lore since childhood.

    " Several months after Hurricane Andrew struck south Florida, five friends and myself were on a hog hunting trip in an area just south east of the Big Cypress Indian Reservation. My friends had a camp there, along with other people who had been there for years. This area is a weekend get away spot were people go to hunt and camp. The area is very swampy and filled with many oak and cabbage palm hammocks and cypress heads. To get around the terrain you must have a four wheel drive swamp buggy with good clearance. On this particular day we had drove many hours in search of hog tracks. We used dogs to sniff out the hogs, by driving on the swamp buggy trails. I had noticed a certain trail that had not been used for quit some time and no visible buggy tracks. I came up to a big puddle in the road and notice that the animals in the area had been using it to drink from. I saw hog tracks, deer, turkey, raccons, birds. Noticing the hog tracks I drove completely around the pool of water to save this a as a marker to return later in the evening. Around midnight we drove two buggies into the area that I suspected hogs would be hiding from the midday sun. We drove all night crashing down palmetto bushes that had grown up in this area on the trails.  During this time no other human sign had been observed until the next day. At the pool of water where I saw the animal sign I returned and found some strange tracks. I appeared to be human shaped, bipedal. One was very big and the other very small like a child''s or possibly deformed. The tracks had a stride of approximately six feet, with a depth of two to three inches . I tried to imitate the step and stride and could not. I would fall over and barely broke the surface of the mud a half inch. When I stomped my foot into the mud I still could not reach the depth of the suspicious tracks. I went back to the camp and told my friends what I had found. We then returned to the location later that evening and to my amazement new tracks were found. The  maker of the tracks had returned after my departure. It may be noted that myself and friends are veteran law enforcement officers who have seen it, done it and got a T-shirt . We don''t believe what we hear and half of what we see. At this point we were very suspicious and concerned about what we had stirred up out of the swamp the night before. We had a 8 mm vhs camera and video taped the tracks and the comparison of our tracks. Three out of five of us believed that we had found the tracks of an escaped gorilla , being that the hurricane had damaged the Miami zoo and reports of escaped monkeys had been reported. Or the tracks of a skunk ape.  Being police officers you don''t run back to town and tell everyone that you saw skunk ape tracks while on a vacation. We left the area in amazement and discussed the possibilities of it being a skunk ape. While riding back to camp approximately 3 miles from the suspicious track location on a hard dry road bed we found another set of tracks.  The track impressions were as deep as the ones found near the mud. At this time we were convinced that no human had made these tracks because of the lack of other vehicle tracks and the fact that someone walking 3 miles barefoot in this terrain with one bad foot was unlikely. We video taped this track spot as well. Upon returning home a couple of us were convinced that this needed further investigation.  I spoke with some of the old timers that had hunted this part of the country and they laughed about my tale.   Later in the spring I returned to the area to try to locate the tracks again so that I could take casts and photos if I found anything. The area was like what I had found prior to driving in the swamp months earlier, no tire tracks just the local inhabitants, hogs, deer ,turkey. These woods are thick and I do believe that an intelligent creature could sneak around undetected from civilized man. The land is rich with food and shelter. I have moved away from my home in the Glades and often wonder if I had scared a skunk ape from his hiding spot in that pristine oak hammock during the fall of 1993 or was it a prankster. We never told anyone out side our circle of friends and never read about mysterious tracks found in the Everglades and or spoke with anyone down there that might have seen the same tracks. I guess it will! <BR> be my own little my life''s mystery. <BR><BR>",

    " A friend and I had just started heading home from a day trip in the conifer area of Colorado. As we drove down a stretch of road with approx 1/2 miles visibility, we \"both\" saw a creature run from one side of the highway to the other. This creature was tall considering we had been about 4-500 hundred feet away in the car. It effortlessly took a few long strides and cleared the entire width of the road. It was clearly upright on two feet, which at that point both of us looked at each other wide eyed, like we couldn''t really register what we''ve just saw. Once we pulled off to the spot that it had crossed, we both took notice that there was about 5-6 mule deer that seemed to be completely undisturbed or spooked. We both realized that if this was a human, these deer would not have been anywhere close to the commotion. This was my very first and only sighting and I''m absolutely positive what we saw was authentic. The mix of weather and the time of day reduced the hiker and tourist traffic that day, so the thought of someone playing games isn''t a viable conclusion to me. My friend is also convinced, since he was raised in New Hampshire and has had similar experiences. Since that day, I''ve been hooked! My friend and I are extreme outdoorsmen with many years of survival training, so we will be spending a lot more time in the area of our sighting soon. Just FYI, the exact area of our sighting was between Wellington Lake and scraggy mountain ranch. Thanks for taking the time to read this as I''m sure you get a ton of submissions. ",

I dont recall exactly what month of the year it was, but there was still abundant snow cover all around our camp area.After breakfast, on a sunny morning, we decided to explore the area.The snow in the area was in many places, up to our waists. After trekking through deep snow , we came upon a trail that was located on a rise from the valley floor. we followed the trail for a short distance, when we came upon some very large footprints. Thinking how strange these footprints looked, (size, shape, ect.) , we knew that they were not of any animal that we knew of. These footprints looked human except that the were very large.( what would a bare-foot ,huge person , be doing way out here in the middle of winter?)we were thinking! We followed the footprints for a while, untill we came to an area where two adjacent mountains joined, at that place the ! snow became very deep, and impossible for us to continue. The footprints, however, continued right up the area, never breaking stride, and not overly disturbing the unbroken snow.

    " I went down to Florida with my family while my dad was working there. We didn''t want to stay in a hotel because we had just bought a camper so we decided to go camping. So we stayed at the Hillsborough River State Park. One day I took my bike out around 2 in the afternoon. The camp had a few trails to ride on so I decided to take one. As I was riding my bike, I stopped and looked over the ledge at a few alligators I spotted. I heard a rustle in the trees and thought maybe it was a gator so i got steady on my bike and got ready to take off. As I was looking around I noticed a tall dark brown hairy figure just standing there looking at me. I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me so I looked harder at it and It took off running. I would also like to note that it was running on two feet, not four. I rode my bike back to my camper as fast as I could and elaborately told my mother and my sister that I just saw Bigfoot. They both claimed I was crazy and told me it was a black bear because the camp guide told us not to leave food out because they had some of them in the area. But I am most certain that this was not a bear. this \"Thing\" stood at least 7 1/2 feet tall and ran upwards on two feet.

    " <BR>I no longer live in Lake Co. but I lived there from 1985-1999. I was working the night shift at a local hospital in Leesburg and lived out near Lake Jem area. I was on my way home about 11:15 one night and just ahead of me I saw the HUGE blackish brown creature run across the road. I slowed for a bit and it ran into the trees not far from the subdivision where I lived.  I said to myself at the time.. what was that? A bear?? Do they run upright?? I got home and mentioned it to my husband (now deceased) and he just blew it off as nothing so I never mentioned it again until he had passed away and I moved to where I live now. <BR><BR>I was talking with a dear friend who really is into the bigfoot movement and she told me that it HAD to be a bigfoot as bears do not run upright and really I guess I knew that.  That night that I saw it, as I continued down the road and turned into my subdivision I had my car window down and I definately could smell a stench that I had never smelled before. At the time I did not know much about the bigfoot but my dear friend has since educated me and I am totally convinced , especiallly since reading this article on Lake Co. Bigfoot that I was fortunate enough to have encountered one. Thank you for your research and positive reinforcement. <BR><BR>I can not remember if this happened late 1985 or very early in the year of  1986 but I believe it was late (oct-dec) 1985",

    " On February 21, 2012 at aprox 2:55pm while traveling on a back county heavily wooded road in Ocala Florida, I observed an animal coming out of the woods on the South side of the road heading North. From this distance I first thought this was a bear coming across the road, however I did notice that the way this animal carried himself did not appear to be a bear. The animal was walking on all fours but appeared to be larger in the front of his body but lower in the hind end, much unlike a bear. He seemed to be bobbing up and down and seemed to me that it was injured. As I approached closer I could see that he was walking on the knuckles of his front arms, appearance was dark brown shaggy coat, not like smooth sheen coat or  fur that would be on a Florida black bear. As the animal approached the edge of pavement, he then stood up on it''s hind legs with a slight curvature and legs bent, he then crossed the road on its hind legs arms swaying or swinging (longer appearance of arms as that of a primate)as I approach closer to the animal and start to slow my vehicle down, this animal turned its head and glanced partially, (matter of factly). At this point I could tell there were no ears such that a bear would have and knew it definitely was not a Florida black. The upper body was massive and as it went down to the hind quarters got increasing smaller. I would estimate that this animal would be 7ft aprox. weight would be around 400 lbs (my best guess).I could not tell what the hind feet looked like due to the amount of hair but I did note that they were longer than that of a bear. As he neared the edge of opposite side of the road he then returned to walk on all fours and as he entered the edge of the wooded area he stood upright again placing right arm on a pine tree, looked over at me and at this i was at a stand still in my vehicle, I could see a full face. Distance from the animal was 50-60ft away.I could tell that he had more of a round shaped eyes, from this distance they appeared to be dark in color with a lighter color of hair around eyes (short and greyish brown, older in  appearance) same hair color would be around the side of face and what would be the area where the ears would be. The nose appeared to be shorter than that of a bear but different than an ape, didn''t have a larger lower lip or chin. the area where the mouth and nose is was short hair and skin appearance.I could also see that the long hair on the arms did not go all the way to the hand area. Hands seemed from that distance to have five fingers much like that of a primate would have. At this point he entered the wooded area and was out of sight. ",

    "  A few years ago I was visiting friends in Dunnellon, Florida. It was New Years Day 2000. There is a state park called Rainbow Springs State Park. I went to the park that morning simply to bird. This is a fairly large state park but only a small fraction of it is open to the public. That morning I wanted to go outside the public areas of that park, just find a trail and keep walking. <BR><BR>The ground was white sand and there were no human foot prints anywhere. I remember this distinctly because I was IDing foot prints of animals and insects. I had a pair of binoculars with me and I was looking for birds as I went along. I figured I was about 2 miles into the park when I came to a clearing, and a stand of White pines on the edge of a field of Saw palmettos.  <BR><BR>The pine closest to the edge of the clearing had a wood duck box mounted on it. I noticed that right away. It made me laugh because the river or nearest water source was over a mile away. I figured a wood duck that used that nest box would have to be desperate. I decided to look at the box through my binoculars hoping I would see a screech owl using it considering I have seen this quite often.  It was then when I noticed something gripping the tree trunk well below the wood duck box. I thought I was seeing things but it was a reddish brown hairy arm. I raised my binocs to get a better look. What I saw still bothers me today. <BR><BR>That arm was attached to something that can only be described as a bigfoot. I got a very good look at it. It was hugging the tree its face pressed to the back of the tree outta sight from the front. It would peek out to look at me then pull back.  <BR><BR>It had grayish black skin around its face. It was pretty much hairless. It had a human like nose, with a slight nose bridge and a nose more typical of people of African decent. It was not like an apes nose at all. They have flat noses with upturned nostrils. <BR><BR>You could not see its nostrils. It had no white to its eyes.The eyes where all brown with black pupils. I could see them dart back and forth, very similar to how a terrified or trapped animals eyes look. <BR><BR>Its lips were thin and it appeared that they were long for its mouth <BR>looked rather big. There was very little hair around the face. It pretty thick on the sides and top of the face/head. I couldnt see any ears. It appeared to have a very short neck with the back of the neck kinda fading into its shoulders. It had a small cone shape to its head It looked very muscular but not blulky. I moved several times to my right and left to get a better look and it moved just like a squirrel does around a tree trying to avoid you. <BR><BR>I can''t say how long this actually went on but it  had to be several long minutes cause I was busy running thoughts through my head as to what I was seeing. The closest thing I could come up with was this had to be an orangutang. The color may have been right but after that, forget it. I decided to move forward,  just to get a better look I took two steps toward it (it was about 100 yrds away) and it ducked down and ran like hell. I didn''t see it as it ran away but it left a sea of moving palmettos in its wake. I didn''t make any other noice and I didn''t smell anything.<BR>",

    " Well, this was many-many years ago and I''ve actually been very reluctant to even mention this, but after reading your web site, and seeing various reports on the t.v. / and documentaries, has made me think even more of what I had seen that night.<BR><BR>What happened was one early Morning in 72 or 73, I was with my uncle and we were going either deer or bear hunting.<BR><BR>I would say it was about 4-5 in the morning, it was very crisp morning I would but it maybe 35-45 degrees.<BR><BR>We left my uncles ranch [my uncle and I], as we were going down the road about 3 miles from his house, I noticed out of the headlights what appeared to be maybe a cow coming out of an olive orchard.  As we got closer, I noticed that the creature was on all fours, the upper part [thoracic] seemed to arch and it was higher, than the rear part [postural], the fur was dark but seemed to shine with the headlights, the head itself did seem to be round in a way with the exception that the occipital area seemed to be more pointy. The creature crossed the 2 way road, I would say that the length of the body itself was almost 1/2 the length of this 2-way country road. I did notice that it crossed the road in, I would say 3 strides.  When it got to the other side it went down the irrigation ditch 2ft down, at this time it was coming out of the headlights, but the figure seemed to have stood, then take one step over the fence.  So if we figure that it stood on a irrigation ditch 2ft below the road and then took a step over a 4ft fence, what ever it was huge.   <BR><BR>There were things that did catch my attention. <BR> <BR>1.The fur how it shined, it seemed to sway with the movements of the body.<BR><BR>2. At the level of the shoulders, I would say it was as the same height, as my uncles F-250 4wd, which I will say that the hood stands easily 5ft.<BR><BR>3. As we approached the creature did turn his head to look at us, the face was dark, humanoidish like, it''s eyes where planted firmly in front and not to the side, also the creature seem to like growl at us because it did show us his teeth.<BR><BR>4. Now when the creature did turn his head, it seem to do so with some difficulty, as it completed its rotation of the head it seem to make its right shoulder move towards the back and I would attribute this because it had a very short neck.<BR><BR>5. The eyes in the headlights were RED, but yet the teeth did not seem to shine yet you knew they were teeth, also the mouth area seemed to be almost flat like, in other words more human like, and not a snout like a bear or cat would have.<BR><BR>After we passed I do remember my uncle mentioning that there must be a skunk around cause it stank.  Personally, I cannot smell so I cannot account to that.<BR><BR>After it crossed the fence I could not see it any more.<BR><BR>p.s. You could see the movement of the muscles of the upper body.",

    "Two days or so before I had been stationed alone at the entrance doing general cleaning while waiting for the bus to arrive with my next tour. I didn''t think much of it at first but there were rocks comming down the hill side and hitting the building. This became more frequent and disturbing as the area above was trees and brush, not likely just a rock slide. The numer of times this occured also became much more frequent through out the weeks. Then came a sort of rainy cloudy day in March of 2001, I think, when I was on the mountain by myself. At Lake Shasta Caverns we had tours leaving 3 times a day and it was the last one that day. From way up on top of the mountain you couldn''t see much beyond you and I''d say the visiblity was 300 yards or less. My tour arrived and turned out to only be two people, a male and female. The bus driver turned the bus around and returned to the bottom of the hill. As the three of us were standing there we were looking out across the ravine talking quietly when we heard some rustling and distinct thumps on the ground. They asked me what it was and I just kept watching thearea it was comming from. As we were looking up and down the ravine 200yrds away, a never before noticed, but clearly viewable, skid path was spotted by the man on my tour. He had a high pwered scope type camera and zoomed in. All the while we were still waiting to see what was moving down the ravine at such a high speed and moving the tops of what I thought to be pretty large trees on this path. And out of the overgrowth we saw it. Huge, on two feet arms clearly swinging wide in front of it and behind it. In a matter of 2 seconds or so it was no longer visible but we could still hear it. The thumping was it''s feet running down hill to the water of the lake, straight down. The echo continued until suddenly a silence. I turned to the man and asked if he got it. He said,\" I don''t know, I think so.\" I then immediatly ran for the emergency radio we keep in the storage/employee room and called down to the bus at the bottom. I told them what we all saw and to be careful and get up here, we want to go, NOW. My boss then came across and told me to calm down, get inside the building and wait there for the bus. When we got back across the lake to the main gift shop I exchanged numbers with the people on the tour but my boss kept theirs and I have not gotten anything from the from that day. The only thing I know about them is that they live in Santa Rosa california somewhere and were on vacation. I quit my job as a tour guide there shortly after because I wouldn''t sit up on that mountain by myself ever again. It is a penninsula with no raods, houses, or people. 30 miles west and 10 miles East of pure nothing, accessable only by boat. Perfect habbitat I would say.",

    " Id like to do it this way, still not sure exactly what happened. <BR>Im with a paranormal invest group, earlier this monthwe went to Round Valley (Covelo) In calif. One of the investigations was a night time walk up a hill at a rancher''s property in Covelo; earlier in the week, from what I remember hearing, was a Bigfoot had been interacting twice with his horses, which he chased off, so we hit that spot. Except me, I stayed in the car with a video game and a flashlight onhand. Maybe 10-15 mins after everyone else took off up the hill, I noticed a movement by the rear passenger window at the driver''s side of the car, something a gold-tan color was standing by the back window. Turned off the interior light in the car and sat in the dark a little while, maybe 4-5 mins, then turned it back on. Whatever it was came back to the window again; this time I heard what I guess has to be described as ''patting/palming'' the door of the car. I about lost it then, ( I dont scare, so this is really strange), and turned off the light, didnt turn it back on till everyone else came back down the hill. Just before people returned, I saw something run past the car really fast, up toward the front of the car line ( we had 4 cars there, I was in the last one). No one else saw the running whatever, they checked the door but didnt see any muddy handprints or anything on it. Im still frazzled, been dealing with all types of wild animals  since I was a kid ( aunt worked witha  zoo and Ive done wildlife rehab since I was a kid). Heard from someone in town there that BF''s have a way of sort of mentally ''fear-paralyzing'' animals; this sort of explains why I tried to turn myself into a tall thin stick when I was sitting there.

    " In February of 2011 I was traveling down Highway 95 between Potlatch, Idaho, and Tensed, Idaho between 12:00 a.m. and 2:00 a.m. It was wooded pasture off to the right side of the highway and open grass pasture and creek on the left (drivers side) of the highway. I was driving into a curve before Wiegand Private Road when approximately 40-50 ft in front of me I saw a very large, dark form walk straight across the highway, right to left. I assumed it was a human so I slowed to full stop in the middle of the highway, which was empty both directions except for me. It was at this point that I realized that I could not see this person off the side of the highway or out in the grass pasture to my left. I had my high beams on and the area was very well lit from that. <BR><BR>I developed an awful sense of dread and immediately hit the gas and headed for home, which was about 5-6 miles away. I was so bothered by this event that I continually checked my rear view mirror, fully expecting to see something horrible or have something horrible happen to me. Once I got home I bolted into the house, turned all the lights on, and woke my family up. They kind of laughed it off but my dog crawled up into my lap and whined/cried at me and wouldn''t leave my side. I definitely didn''t sleep that night and started avoiding driving that highway so late at night. It wasn''t until later that I really started to process the details of what happened. I realized that I saw someone, very distinctly bipedal, walk across the highway. I remember the walking motion of the legs and the slight swinging motion of the arms. I also realized that while I had my high beams on the figure was completely black. No reflection from clothes, shoes, or even a shadow thrown onto the highway. The other thing that very much bothered me was that I never took my eyes off of what happened but somewhere between the figure walking across the highway and walking off the side, it disappeared. I definitely should have been able to see something walking down the side of the ditch or into the pasture, but it was completely empty. It took me quite some time to come to terms with what happened and even longer before I admitted to myself that it may have been a Sasquatch related sighting. I''ve recently been compelled to report this specific sighting due to the fact that recently a woman claimed to have seen a Sasquatch right before hitting a deer in almost the exact same area and a similar time frame but she''s been made into a joke in the local news. I don''t know if she actually saw Sasquatch, but I find it a very, very odd coincidence that it happened in that area of the highway and in the same time frame.",

Myself and a frind were fourwheeling on light, snow covered roads at about two am. we came around a corner and we both saw something run across the road.  it had very long, shagy red hair and it was running on all fours.  something like a gorilla would when charging.  we only observed it cross the road when we apperently spooked it.  we are both outdoorsman and have seen bears and the like befor.  when it happened, we both simultaneously looked at each other said \"what the hell was that?\" and then said \"we better not tell anyone or they''ll think were crazy!\"  I can''t swear to what it was, but I''ll swear it wasn''t a bear.  this thing was the wrong color to be any kind of cat and it was to thin through the torso as compared to its overall size to be a bear and i suspect bears would have already been in hybernation.  the hair looked like it could have been 18 inches long, very shagy.  its body shape was like a giant human, not a cat or bear.  unfortunately the animal never turned its face toward us at all.",

As I climbed over I noticed, 30 feet away another tree that was also laying on the ground. As I looked, I saw a Bigfoot, stooped over, watching me from behind the trunk. The face was a medium black, with a large brow bone that almost stuck out as far as it''s nose. The hair was medium brown with light spots (light reflections?). It''s face had darker lines where the skin folded. The face was smaller than one would expect on an animal this size. The eyes were brown and set a little closer than a humans. The nose was flat and wide. <BR><BR>I noticed it''s lips as being black and thin after it curled it''s lip up while he was staring at me. I also noticed the teeth and the lack of any K-9''s. It seamed to be around 5 foot tall while stooping over, but could have been around 8 feet when standing erect. After a few seconds it turned and disappeared behind the tree. I went over to area and saw several prints in the forest debris. I followed the prints uphill but soon lost the tracks due to the forest debris.",

    " New to the area in July 2005, I had been traveling from Crescent City, CA over the Pass (Hwy 199) weekly to Grants Pass and back and now in the Winter of 2006, it was 2X weekly.  My wife had not joined me and we were separated and I was attending counseling classes in Medford, OR.<BR><BR>We had 5 children and I had my son living with me and he was back at home.  He was about 13.<BR><BR>This particular night I was delayed on my return from Medford in the evening (usually arriving back in Crescent City around 1215 AM).  It is roughly an hour from the Tunnel to arrive in either Crescent City or Brookings, OR where I live now.<BR><BR>I had stopped @ the Bug Station and rested (because I was delayed in my return) sitting with the heater on and engine idling and doors locked.  The little phone booth shack for Inspections there now, was not there yet.  After closing my eyes about 40 minutes, I''m guessing like 1225 AM, I was rested and awake to get going again back to Crescent City.<BR><BR>I use my High Beams because it is so dark through there and everyone does because it is like signaling any opposing traffic of your whereabouts (everyone is usually polite to lower them upon the distance closing).<BR><BR>I left the Tunnel and traveled down the hill and began the series of ''S'' turns through the Pass (it''s like a Canyon and runs adjacent to various sections of the Smith River).<BR><BR>I was slowing through the 2nd ''S'' turn and was watching my headlights and the shadows of the Roadside barriers as they were casting the shadows in the trees along the river.<BR><BR>My truck was an older Chevy Dually with a small diesel and it was not a Powerhouse like the newer ones.  I was just cruising with the turns and taking my time.  It had a shell with an 8 foot bed and it was used by a retired couple to tow their trailer so it is kind of slow.<BR><BR>The lights are low to the ground and when the high beams are on the go out further and up higher.  You can be seen by anyone else and they can see you from a ways off.<BR><BR>As I rounded the turn and was approaching the end of the turn while watching my high beam shadows of the barricade up in the trees, I noticed this BIG Dark Shadow cast in the trees from my lights as I rolled along and my lights lit up a Giant Creature walking along the opposite side, going against traffic- facing away from me.  I said to myself, \"Oh shit!\" and was very excited.  The next part of the turn was coming up right away and I immediately thought to turn around to see it''s face.  I knew it was Bigfoot (Sasquatch) and wanted to see his face but, I was too close still to maneuver around and go the other way and the turn was too shallow.  A thousand things went through my mind, \"what does he look like, don''t turn around yet, what if he''s hostile, he''ll beat up my truck, don''t turn around here....\"<BR><BR>The logging trucks fly through there and my slow diesel would have to do a 3 point turn around or more and possibly get T-boned.  I was excited but, also a bit scared.  This was amazing.<BR><BR>I kept telling myself \"Not yet.  Don''t turn around here.\" I kept looking for spots along the rode to turn around , even a little room, because I really wanted to see it''s face.  The mix of it being late, a tight turning canyon, being afraid and also excited - I was bewildered a little..., \"What do I do?\"<BR><BR>Almost immediately it was now the small FAST ''S'' turns (very narrow) that lead to the Narrow passage (it is extremely tight through there and you can see the Tree hanging off the cliff above the roadway in the daytime..., and, this leads to the Resort @ Patricks Creek Lodge).<BR><BR>As I passed I was still shaken up and thought what do you do, no one will believe me. As I passed Little Jones Creek I decided to forget about turning around because 1. I had really seen it 2. It was late and no one would believe me anyhow (I did not have a  regular cell phone- it was a cheap Android and off due to no reception- a real long Start-up time when turned on).<BR><BR>So, heres what I saw and why I am documenting it.<BR><BR>It was over 8'' Tall..., I am 6''2\" and played Basketball since 4th grade even against 7'' players in high school (I was a Leaper and could jump really high- I was 6'' when I was 12- stopping my growth @ 15 years old @ 6''2\").  I could not accurately guess the weight but well over 4-500 pounds- possibly 600, 700 or even 800.<BR><BR>He had no neck with a Pointed-type head buried between his MASSIVE shoulders..., Huge Shoulders.  I was going slow enough through the turn to see his fingers, toes and palms and foot bottoms as he walked but his hair was like a Llama- matted looking but long and, longer and shorter on different parts of his body.  He was Light Grey to Smokey Charcoal Grey with some Black deeper in beneath his hair closer to his body.<BR><BR>The hair was long on his calves, forearms, hands and feet so I just saw tips of long fingers.  His feet bottoms were flipping TOUGH (I''ll spell it TUFF) because they were Wide and what I would describe as Padded.  He walked swinging his harms down near his knees but above them and up right, not hunched over like an ape..., he was walking but just massive- those Shoulders.  I saw him a good 3 - 4 seconds.<BR><BR>His Torso was Longer in proportion to his legs, his leg length of Thigh to Calves was not as long as his upper body- he was Huge.<BR><BR>I went to work the next day and told a co-worker who had lived up here for over 20 years and an avid hunter and fisherman and he is also part Cherokee so , I know I could trust him.  He has spent countless hours Elk hunting, and bear hunting. He looked at me kind of silly and sluffed it off so I just shut up..., \"You''ve only been up here about 8 months and you''ve already seen Bigfoot?\"<BR><BR>I know what I saw.<BR><BR>After learning more and now hearing the term Gigantopithecus I looked it up and the Tropical is the one I saw.  Turn the animal around and that is exactly what was ''walking'' down the roadway.<BR><BR>Here''s a link to the picture that convinced me to tell my experience:<BR><BR>http://knobbythebigfoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/gigantopithecus_human.jpg<BR><BR>I''m going to start looking for him soon.  If they are active @ night then I''m getting Thermal and Night Vision and want to try and get a video of him.<BR><BR>",

    " My wife and I were driving to Indianapolis to see our parents. It was around 10:30 PM when we saw a large creature cross the interstate. It crossed about 200-300 yards in front of our car from the left to the right. It seemed to take about four steps to cross three lanes of interstate highway. The creature looked exactly like the bigfoot in the Patterson film. My wife and I both said did you see that? We were driving about 60 miles an hour and by the time we traveled the distance to the bigfoot crossing it had crossed the road and was gone. It was nighttime and the creature was illuminated by the oncoming traffic. ",

    " While backpacking near the horse trails and access point in the county below Brown County I experienced a confrontation with a bipedal primate. It was early March of 1998 and I was alone. Around seven oclock in the evening after hiking several miles I set up camp in a wooded area about 100 yds. from the horse trail. Darkness was descending quickly so I was in a rush to set up camp and prepare my supper. After gathering firewood and getting my fire started for light and cooking I suddenly began hearing leaves and brush rustling below me and to the east along a ravine that I camped above. At that moment I thought to myself that it was a bit early for mushroom hunters and probably to dark for them to see any. Perhaps its a deer? <BR><BR>Anyway, I grabbed my knife for protection and grabbed the flashlight cautiously approached the ravine where the noises were coming from. I yelled out in the direction of the sounds and aimed my flashlight and to my astonishment viewed a very tall upright human looking being hiding behind a clump of trees close to the stream. The creature stood about seven feet tall as I could see his silhouette from the left side of the trees. He was leaning forward and exposing his head to view me. He or it was approximately 40 feet from my position and the light from my flashlight shined into its eyes.I could see that he had dark hair covering his Conical shaped head and dark eyes in the front of his skull. I knew immediately that this couldn''t be a man. I was very frightened and yelled out again in hopes of scaring him off. He ran into the stream and away from me about 6 feet before ducking behind another tree. I continued to follow him with my flashlight and screaming at him with threats. This went on for 2 or 3 minutes before he took off running down the creek out of sight. <BR>The rest of the night I stayed awake near my camp fire fearing a return visit and waiting for daylight to return to my truck. I would have packed out that night, only my truck was in the direction that the hairy biped fled. And I was miles in.This entire situation was very frightening to me because I always thought that if Bigfoot existed it would be in the Cascades or the Canadian Rockies. <BR>",

    " Although I have had very good class B encounters, this Class A sighting was something that I will treasure.<BR><BR>On Feb. 1, 2007 I took my husband to Show Low AZ to drop him off for 10 days with friends. The weather had been bad that day and progressively worsened so that I did not take my normal route back to N.M. which is through the White Mt. Apache Res. I went down U.S. Hiway 60, it runs between Show Low and Springerville AZ.  Past a small town called Vernon, the terrain loses almost all of the juniper trees and is mostly rolling grassy hills.<BR><BR>I have learned a type of defensive driving in Elk country, wherein you keep alert to the peripheal vision movement. Something drew my attention to the left hand side of the road and I applied brake anticipating an animal (elk, deer, pronghorn etc.). What I saw made me turn and pay attention. <BR><BR>It was bipedal and running dead at the road. I slowed as fast as possible and watched in open mouthed awe as the creature placed one hand on the t-post (metal pole used in barbed wire fencing) and vaulted over the fence, slowing very little and continued running. It crossed the road (2 lane black top) in maybe two full strides and kept going into a narrow canyon and beyond my sight.<BR><BR>I pulled to the side of the road and called my husband. He could not believe what I was saying. He finally asked me to get out of the car and look for tracks or hair or solid evidence (once a cop always a cop). In very unladylike words I told him no.  I was alone, unarmed and unwilling to meet something that big on a road that I had seen fewer cars in two hours than I had fingers on my hands.<BR>The creature was dark brown and had longish hair. I never saw its face full on, it had to be close to seven feet tall or more. It never seemed to be afraid or running dead out.  More like a lope or steady jog.<BR><BR>The weather was cold and heavily cloudy, mix of precip. off and on all day. No standing snow. It was around 1530-1600. ",

    " I saw an unidentified animal around 7:55 P.M. on 12/7/12 on the side of the road with gray fur<BR><BR>I was driving at night on I-40 W from Little Rock to Conway around the 144 marker. It was on the right hand side of the road and was in a slumped/ sitting position. The animal was very large and had long gray/silver/black hair but mostly a dirty light gray. The best view of the animal I got was the broad side of its back.  The widest part of the body was at the elbows and it appeared to be about 4.5ft wide. From what appeared to be the head to the ground was about 5.5 ft tall. As I passed by I tried slowing down and was able to see  a profile shot of the animal. It appeared to be sitting looking at something on the ground. I would guess that it could be a deer that was hit by a car. I see deer at night on the sides of the road here almost every night coming through this area. <BR><BR>The size of the animal was scaled to a road sign I saw just before the sighting. It was a large 4x4 sign that was turned backwards so all I could only see is the gray back. Minuets later after I saw the sign, the same distance from the road and slightly down the embankment was the anima (about 1.5-2 ft away from the white line).  The hair was similar to that of those long haired cows all over the body but still was able to see muscles under the hair very similar to a gorilla. <BR><BR>After it happened I was not sure what I saw. I tried to classify the animal. To this day I have no ideas for sure what I saw. I have seen hundreds of animals at night driving and this was the first thing I could not ID. The animal had an eerie resemblance to a Bigfoot. At the time I had never heard of a Bigfoot with light colored hair and until I saw an episode of Finding Bigfoot where an eye whitness saw a white colored Bigfoot. <BR><BR>I am open to any possibilities of the ID of this animal. Please let me know the BFRO''s thoughts. <BR><BR>Thanks!<BR>",

    " I''m probably going to regret telling this story. Everyone I know will probably laugh me out of the country. I myself for many years would hooraw and laugh every time someone would mention these creatures. Here it goes. I live in Northeast Texas not far from Texarkana. I haved lived in the Texarkana area for quite some time. I don''t coonhunt anymore my business has become more demanding. Coonhunting is a sport that really demands a lot of time. I found I didn''t have the time to devote to it so I got rid of my Walker hounds. I was so into the sport at one time I had hunting Licenses in 3 states. I had several Night Champions to my credit. <BR><BR>Several years ago on a cold night in Jan/Feb I believe it was in 2000 - don''t remember the exact date. I was coonhunting in Miller County, Arkansas. I don''t know exactly how far from Mercer Bayou we were but I know we were in an area the ole timers call Thornton Wells. While we were hunting in this flooded timber, our dogs split treed. I went to my dogs who had treed on the other side of the swamp.The other guys went to their dogs on the other side. I got to the tree my dogs were treeing at and looked at my coon and caught my dogs. Everthing seemed ok so I decided to amble back toward the others. I could just barely hear their dogs treeing way across the bayou. Suddenly I heard something walking in the flooded timber. (Bare in mind this whole area is 8-15 inches flooded with brackish swamp water.) I could tell by the gate that it was someone coming in the flooded woods. So I called out to them thinking it must of been one of my hunting companions. To my dismay no one answered - instead all I heard was a deep throated gurgling growl and the awfullest putrid smell. The smell was like when you kill a wild hog and grab him by the hind leg and then you give out dragging him and put your hand up to your nose and the smell knocks you over. I also heard a whining kind of a whistling sound. My dogs were on my leash and were whimpering. Now these weren''t just any dogs. These were UKC Lipper bred Walkers, they probably weighed in at close to a 100lbs.They would could rip a 20lb coon apart. Yet there they were cowardly crouched behind my legs whimpering. I knew I had seen them tear coyotes to shreads that had tried to come into a tree where they were treeing. I couldn''t understand it. Still in all I was not concerned about any of this and got my dogs and started back across the swamp. After a few mintues I heard this sound of someone or something walking in the water again. So I stopped and turned around and standing right behind me was a creature of immense size. He must have been at least 8 or 9 ft tall. He was covered from head to toe with a real dark hair and when my coonbuster coon light hit in the eyes his eyes glowed like a deer in a spotlight. Talking about the hair on the back of your neck standing up, I was scared. I don''t ever remember being that scared. He made a hissing sound and reached down and took his hand and started scooping water and throwing it up at me and making a deep throaty noise. My dogs started chomping at the leash and growling trying to get at it, having regained their bravery. I grabbed the leash and tore out across that swamp so scared that for awhile I went in the wrong direction. I got to a big Cypress knee and caught my breath. I could hear the thing behind me sounded like it was about a 100 yards or so back. It followed me for a ways then after a while I could hear it across the bayou making a moaning sound and moving away slowly. I got my breath and my compass and my bearings and started back to the truck. When I got there I didn''t say a word to my friends about what I saw and heard for fear they would laugh me down. Needless to say I never returned to Thorton Wells nor do I plan to. For a long time I kept this to myself I even had nightmares about it. The only person I ever told was an old coonhunter from Doddridge, Ark. He''s dead and gone now but I do remember something he said to me that day. He said, if you''re smart you''ll keep that to yourself I know from experience that people will laugh at you and call you a liar. I''ve hunted in the Sulphur River bottoms many nights but never have I seen anything like that before or since. I''m not one for tall tales but I thought I would share this terrifying ordeal with you all because it seems we might have something in common. ",

    " In December of 2010 (I think it was the around the 15th, whatever the 2nd muzzle loading season fell on during that year.) I was going deer hunting on private family property very close to Elkhorn City, Kentucky.  This was my first time going hunting in a while as I had gave up the sport in my late teens/early tewnties and I would have been 30 at the time of the sighting. The road that I had to travel is passable with a 4-wheel drive and is an old mining/logging road.  The terrain is typical Appalachian terrain and the spot that I was headed to (where my tree stand was located) is on a ridge top and somewhat flat from old mining operations but very steep on one side of the road and somewhat flat on the other.  I was hunting with a muzzle loader gun and as I arrived at my parking spot (in a steep curve in the road and and on a long what we call point, a natural crossing place for deer and other wildlife I got out of the drivers side of my truck and walked behind my truck to get to the passenger door to get my gun and load it.  I am not sure of the time but it was well before daylight.  As I was attempting to load my gun I heard what was coyotes, making a lot of noise which is not uncommon but these were close and I have to admit that I got spooked and hurried and got back in the drivers side of my truck, locked the doors and flipped my head lights back on.  My truck was facing the flat area with the point to my back and the steep hillside on my right.  I cracked my window to listen for other sounds and I heard more coyote sounds and in about 2 - 3 minutes time I heard what I knew had to be a large creature coming from the flat area where my truck was facing.  Keep in mind the coyote sounds were coming from the same direction.  Next I saw something that I have never seen before or since.  I saw a creature that had to be at least 8 feet tall.  It came out of the wooded area towards the left side of my truck.  The creature was moving at a quick speed but when it came out of the clearing it seemed to be shocked to see my truck and apprehensive.  It stopped for maybe 5 to 10 seconds and took off and dissappeared behind me.  The creature had the form of a really big man with long arms and longer hair that covered his whole body.  It walked slumped over almost like it had a hunch back.  My total time of seeing the creature was probably about 10 seconds.  Since this occurance I have seen bear while hunting and I can say for sure that what I saw that December morning was not a bear or anything else that I have ever seen in these hills and mountains.  In a nutshell the creature looked ran/walked like what you see on TV reinactments.  I truely believe that on that morning I saw a Squatch.  I can''t describe how I felt after seeing the creature.  I wasn''t scared but I wasn''t totally comfortable either.  I suppose you can say I was bewildered.",

I always carry a chair to sit in, was sitting for about 35 minutes when I seen a very large man walking though the woods at 1st look. At my 2nd hard look I was looking to see the background to gauge the size of this person. the thing I notice was it was very black ,had no hunter''s orange on.{ in the Nat. Forest you must wear an orange vest and hat}it was white from the ground up on each leg about 12\" to 20\" up both legs. It was about 60 to 80 yards from me only seen it take about 8 or 9 step''s in open woods, it walked behind a falling tree was going to rise my gun to get a better look when it came in to the next opening. It never came out of the brush. I then left.the more i thought about it i had to go see how big was the trees it was walking by. went back the next day i would say to was 9 to 10 feet tall. long legs and arms. i found no foot prints or anything.the ground is very hard we have had no rain.Heard . it was very strange. <BR>",

I do have an on going encounter with many sound and oder encounters which happened the same waythen Ihad the sigting.<BR> It was a winter night about 22:00hrs.I took my dog out. We were outside about ten minutes. When I saw a creature standing 20-25ft. away. Itwas next to a small building with the woods behind it.There was astreet light 50ft.behind me. Iknow it was not my shadow, My shadow stoped 10ft. short of its feet.<BR> As we looked one another over.the dog just wonted to go inside.At this time Iheard a noise to my right I turned to se what it was .Isaw nothing. Iturned back an the creature turned to look also.The smell was like awet deer but ten times worse.The creature was around 8-9ft.tall. Dark hair covered its body.It seemed to get up set becouse I did not run. It took a type of defensive posture and looked me up and down.The mood seamed to change I thought it might charge.At this point I went In side let the dog go got my handgun and went back out but it was gone.However Icould still here him in the woods.<BR> It was about 8-9ft.tall and at the least (500lbs).The shoulder span was around 4-5Ft. I this had to be alarge male. Due to the way it acted and its movement and presents. I say htis from my years of hunting and just whatching wild life.The next day I found single print that was about 5in. wide at the hill .This was the best part You could see. It was about 18-20in. long.I feel there was only the one due to the fact we had norain for weeks.The night was dry and clear. there was no wind or clouds in the sky.<BR> Ihave no dought what Isaw. IKnow what all the local wildlife looks like including the rare black bear that comes alone.<BR> Iwould be very intrested in speaking to some one from your group.This as been going on for the last three years and not slowing down. <BR>  Thanks for giving me a place to report.

I’ve listened to all the .wav files I could find, and the only one that even remotely resembles the sound we’ve heard is the Yowie file. Peculiar. The last time a large group of us heard this sound was at Easter of this year. There were eight of us who heard it that night. The most recent time this was heard was on Thursday, June 13, 2002 at approximately 12:15 a.m. by my wife and her sister. While I can’t speak for everyone else, I can say with confidence that this was not a cow even though there are plenty in this area. That and the fact that most of the sounds we’ve heard come from much further back in the woods where there are no pastures...or cows.",

    " This is a secondhand report posted by the BFRO investigators involved.  Witness information withheld.<BR><BR>The following is the witness&#8217; account as related to Investigator Tim Cullen:<BR><BR>At approximately 1:30 a.m. on a night in February 2000, the witness and a friend were planning to visit a girl who lived close to the sighting location. They were riding together on a motorcycle and knew they would not be able to ride up to the girl&#8217;s house without alerting her mother to their presence. They decided to hide the bike on the side of a dirt road and walk to the house from there. Very shortly thereafter, they began to hear what the witness described as very heavy walking/stomping noises. The witness described these sounds as similar to: 1. an extremely large person walking or  2. like a horse galloping only on two legs, coming from a swampy area which was northeast of their location. They squatted in the bushes and listened for a couple of minutes, at which time they determined the noise was getting closer to them and increasing in pace. At this time they decided to make a break for the motorcycle and vacate the area. The friend of the witness was in the lead and caused a branch to swing back hitting the witness in the head, knocking him down and &#8220;damn near knocking him out.&#8221; He got back up and began running after his friend all the while hearing the sounds of stomping and the crashing of underbrush getting closer to them. When he reached the spot where the motorcycle had been stashed, his friend was already pushing it out towards the road. He commented that at this time he could also hear heavy breathing which seemed to coincide with each footfall. Once they had the bike on the road, they both jumped on and his friend managed to kick start it and take off. The witness stated that he looked back just in time to see a very large creature leap from the edge of the woods out into the road. (I later measured this distance and it was a 12&#8217; to 15&#8217; jump, more or less.) He said it hit the road on all fours and then stood fully erect. He did comment that when the creature landed on the road, it let out an audible grunt he could hear even above the noise of the motorcycle. He said the moon was full or near full, and it was already in the western sky causing the creature to &#8220;stand in its own shadow.&#8221; Since the creature was silhouetted, he was unable to make out any detail such as facial features. However, he was emphatic that what he saw was not a bear as he&#8217;s seen bears before and they are much #8220;narrower&#8221; than what he saw (He emphasized this by hunching his arms forward and dropping his shoulders to indicate how a bear would stand and then standing fully erect with his arms out from his sides in the stance that he said he observed the creature to be in.). He said this creature was very wide and had &#8220;fluffy&#8221; hair which covered it entirely. He was unable to see any fingers on the hands although he did state that from what he could tell the hands appeared to be clenched and that the arms were longer than a human&#8217;s. He also said that from what he could see the creature appeared to be a dark brown or black color. When asked about the height of the animal, he said it was at least six to seven feet tall. After thinking for a moment he stated that his father is 6&#8217; 4&#8221; and that this thing was bigger than his dad, making it closer to seven feet in height.<BR>-----------------------------<BR>What follows is a slightly less detailed report by Investigator Vince Lauria who videotaped the interview at the sighting location:<BR><BR>The sighting took place in February of the year 2000 to the best recollection of the witness, a boy, 15 years old at the time.  The moon was full or nearly so.  He and a friend had just parked a very loud dirt bike at the edge of the woods along the dirt road near a swamp at about 2 a.m.  They planned to walk up on a nearby mobile home to visit a girlfriend.   Their \"caper\" was interrupted when they heard heavy footsteps running through the woods toward them, breaking limbs, etc.  The main witness was slapped in the head by a limb that was released as the other boy pushed the bike back off of a sandy drainage ditch (which fork slightly off these roads) and onto the dirt road.  The witness, almost knocked out by the hit to the head, got up, jumped on the back of the bike and they roared off just as something large and black jumped onto the road, landing on all fours, then stood up and faced them.  The moon was lighting the road, and the creature, from the rear.  Hair was described as long and not shaggy, but \"fluffy,\" dark brown or black.  It stood, obviously broad and manlike and BIG, looking at them as they drove off, its arms at its sides and longer than a man''s arms.  Estimated height near 7 feet.<BR> <BR>Investigator Cullen:<BR>When Vince asked the witness if he&#8217;d gone back the next day to see if they could locate any tracks, he told Vince &#8220;Hell no I haven&#8217;t gone back!&#8221; He said it was probably two weeks or better before they even went near that particular spot again.<BR><BR>",

    " I and two of my friends were bored one night so we decided to do a little snowmachining. Though it was illegal to snowmachine in Anchorage, there were some good trails to ride on a little north of my house.  <BR><BR>We took off at probably 11 pm, rode up the road about a quarter mile, and cut off on the trails. It had snowed about 10 inches a few days before so there was fresh snow, with no tracks.  <BR><BR>I was leading the way for about a half hour, then we stopped and talked for a little bit.  We took off again and kept cruising on some sort of game trail that led to an opening in the woods.  I rode off into the opening with my friends following about fifty yards behind me.  <BR><BR>I came over this little mound and saw strange tracks leading to this spot in the snow where it looked like something had pushed aside some snow and layed down.  I figured it was just a moose or something.  But I followed the tracks over the next small hill and as I came down the far side my headlight pointed right on the back of a bigfoot. <BR><BR> It was only about 10 to 12 feet in front of me.  It was running in the opposite direction.  I slammed on the brakes because I was scared out of my mind.  It continued to run away, jumped over a dead log covered in snow and disappeared into a group of trees and into the darkness.  <BR><BR>I was so surprised and scared I quickly turned around and rode back toward my friends. I met them back by the first mound and said \"We need to get out of here,\"  and rode back towards my house.  When I told them about it back near my house, they laughed and told me it was probably a bear or someone in the woods.  But I was 100% positive that is was not a bear or anything else. <BR><BR>The way it was running through the deep snow made me sure that it wasn''t anything human.  For a long time I was made fun of and everyone told me I was crazy so I didn''t like talking about it.  ",

I was ready to call the police. The screams seemed to be coming from down the neighbors drive getting closer and closer. Then, from the back wooded edge of our property (which borders the neighbor''s drive), I heard what I thought was a loud owl, but kind of like a peacock. The scream was in the middle of two other sounds (howls?) There were about 3 scream-sequences and 3 owl-peacock calls. Once I opened the window it quit.

Within about a year of the sighting, in the middle of the night the dog went crazy barking, scratching to get out. We let her out. She ran into the woods in the direction of our neighbor''s pond barking all the way. All of a sudden there was a yelp and then nothing. The next day we combed the woods but all we found was a little piece of meat that looked like liver. We always thought it was coyotes.

    " My niece was living with us at the time of the sighting.  She was a senior in high school.  Our house is about 6 miles out of town and in 1987 when the incident occurred, it was very rural, though now it has become quite developed.  The school buses didn''t go down the side roads so kids would have to walk to the closest main road.  We live not too far off the bus route.  The neighbor girl drove to school and she would often stop and give my niece a ride as she was walking to the bus stop.  On this particular morning she had just gotten in the neighbor''s car when about 50 yards ahead, this creature came out of the swamp area on the right side of the road, paused in a crouching position, started crossing, then dashed very quickly across the road and into the woods.  She said she turned to the neighbor girl and said, \"What the hell was that?\"  To which the girl answered \"I don''t know!\"  She says it was about the size of a bear, brown in color, but was definitely not a bear.  It started crossing the road walking like a gorilla (she even wondered if it could have been an orangutan or some kind of ape), then it ran the rest of the way very fast on all fours.  The whole incident happened so fast that she was not able to see much of the hands or feet.  She described it to me as being like an ape, but also sloth-like.  I said unless there had been an escaped primate from a traveling circus, we just don''t have them in Washington.  She said it had hair covering its entire body and she noticed hair hanging from its arms.  She also heard from the swamp a whoop-whoop-whoop sound.  Thinking back she realizes that she had heard that sound coming from the swamp before, but thought it was some kind of bird.  It ran into an area of hundreds of wooded acres which eventually dip into the valley beyond (we are up on a plateau).  There is a ravine in the middle of this area.  To the right, past the swamp and as the crow flies there is Woods Creek about a mile or more away.  The deer pass by this area headed toward water at Woods Creek.  My niece said that she and the neighbor girl didn''t say a word all the way to school and when they arrived she said again \"What WAS that?\" They both were dumbfounded.  She said it gave her the creeps and she felt scared.  We have talked about it on and off for years trying to think what it could have been.  A couple of weeks ago we sat down and I made a sketch while she guided me.  Actually she had to modify and finish it because I just could not figure out what she meant about how the head, chest and face looked.  When I saw her alterations I thought no wonder she was scared.<BR>    ",
    :environment
    "Back then the area was primarily mixed evergreen and deciduous woods with lots of understory of blackberries, salmon berry, wild plum and other NW bushes. There are a number of wetlands in the immediate vacinity. We had a pond which is now dried up, our neighbor had a pond (still do) and the swamp where the creature came from was a haven for wetland birds. Around March all these ponds are full of frogs mating and laying eggs, which ducks and herons would feed on. There was a large amount of undeveloped land all around. We had an orchard and many of the people in the area including us raised chickens, rabbits and goats. The fruit trees tended to draw deer. At night we would sometimes hear something large leaning on the goat gate, grunting and rattling it. We assumed it was a bear.",

    " I was living in Whatcom County 5 minutes from the small town of Everson, WA. I worked on a dairy farm out in Custer, WA. I had to be work at 6:00 AM to feed calves, however, I did my best to get there a half-hour early just in case a cow had a calf in the night so that I could tag it, Vac it, tube it and move it before the other calves woke up for their morning feed. <BR><BR>I got out of bed at 4 AM and got ready to go, ate a small breakfast, and left the house at 5:05 AM to head for the farm. As I started down my road I got a funny feeling. I came to a Stop sign and got ready to turn when I caught sight of movement in the headlights. At first I thought that a deer was preparing to jump over the blackberries and onto the road until I focused on what it was I was looking at. <BR><BR>The creature blinked and reached up its hand to grasp a limb of a tree. It was sickly skinny! Its elbow joints protruded, and I could see the clavicle bone and the shoulders had a dip between where the arm connected to the body. I could see a massive rib cage and a sickly sunken stomach on this animal. I could see the tops of this animals pelvic bone protruding. It had a very clear thigh gap. The sides of the head were sunken in on either side and the face was gaunt with high cheekbones. The animal leaned against the tree it was holding onto for support. I was shocked and scared, but I knew what I was seeing was real. So I tried to take in as much as I could. The animal didnt seem too keen on moving. He just stood there staring back at my car like deer in the headlights. <BR><BR>It was anywhere from 85 to 89 tall and about 3''6\" wide (I came back and measured a week later based on the tree branch it held on to). It was covered in dark medium length fur with patches of gray around the face and peppered throughout the body. Its head road low to the shoulders with very little neck showing, and its eyes glowed yellowish greenish white in the headlights. Its head had a high cranial ridge, making it look pin headed for lack of a better word. Its arms were very long with the fingers of the creature just above the knee. Its eyes were forward facing and quite round and deep set with a broad, protruding forehead. Its nose was flat, with a thin lipped slightly protruding mouth like a gorilla but not as angled with the mouth. Its face had deep set wrinkles. <BR><BR>Thinking back now I believe this poor animal didnt have the energy to run. He just stood there staring back at me. I finally decided to turn onto the road and head to work. As I hit the gas going towards this creature he startled and bared his teeth at me. I know from documentaries that when a monkey bares its teeth it is a sign of aggression. <BR><BR>The thing that struck me is that its mouth was missing a bottom canine and the rest of them were worn nearly flat. The other teeth were chipped with a few broken close to the gums and nearly gone. I hit the gas at that point because I was turning left and had to go right past this animal within about 10 to 15 feet of it. <BR><BR>The reason I didnt report this sooner was because I was worried how people would react, and also I wondered what this animal was doing there in the first place. After thinking it through, it hit me. There was a chicken farm in the area. I truly believe this Sasquatch was older and starving to death. It happened to be a really awful Winter, with the most snow that part of Washington had seen in 20 years, with several ice storms, and heavy snows and with temperatures plummeting into the low teens. I think it had come down from the foot hills into the town outskirts to try to snatch a few chickens as an easy meal. I think I surprised him, thinking that no humans would be out that early in the morning. <BR><BR>A week later I saw the chicken owner while I was walking my dog. I asked how their chickens were and they told me that the week before, they believed that a few coyotes had gotten in and had snatched two of their hens that were sleeping in the outdoor shelter.<BR><BR>There is a thick dense forest that goes on for miles straight up into the mountains. It is home to deer, black bear, coyotes, and the occasional mountain lion.<BR><BR>I was born and raised in Montana. I hunt and fish and I have seen a lot of animals both wild and domestic. I am also a huge animal lover and have watched countless documentaries on every animal you can think of. So believe me when I say that I know animals and what I saw was not cougar nor was it a bear. I have seen them both in the wild, in zoos, and on documentaries. I would not miss identifying a bear for what I saw.",

    " I rode to work one morning with my boss while logging just off the canadian washington border. We were parked at a landing waiting for it to get light enough to start. My boss stepped out of the pickup and said bigfoot? I said what? I went to his side of the truck to see what he was looking at.There was tracks about 15-16 inchs long. I put my feet in them and fell about 2 feet short of the next one, maybe 5 or 6 feet apart. The tracks continued like that as far as I could see. We were leaving at dark everyday, and arriving before light, and it was snowing just about everyday or night.These tracks were fresh. My boss seen bigfoot while he was logging on the olyimpic peninsula and was convinced they were sasquatch.I wasn''t sure just yet. Later while working I got a chill up my spine and the hair on the back of my head stood up like it does on a dog or cat when they sense something. I began flipping my head side to side trying to see something but couldn''t see anything but it sure felt like I was being watched. Every now and then I would wind an animal up wind. Could have been a wolf, I spotted one in the area. I did hear what sounded like someone banging a stick on a tree. I followed the sound expecting to find a wood pecker, but seen nothing. We were seeing around 15-20 deer a day before that, and hadn''t seen any after that day. A truck driver coming up for a load told us you should have seen all the deer leaving the hill. There must have been 30 maybe 40 down by the road. I thought it could have been that wolf pushing them down, or they just had enough snow. There was 3 feet on the ground in places and temp. was 15 below 0. I asked a friend who logged in Idaho for years if he ever had the hair on the back of head stand up while in the woods. He said only once. He was running a saw and bigfoot walked up behind him. I believe bigfoot was watching us. <BR>",

    " hello. some time back i submitted a report about strange noises i and my family had been hearing over the years. i spoke with someone on the phone from bfro about it and informed him that my father had actually seen a bigfoot here in the past. well, much to my shock and horror i have seen one too. i was checking on my children in their bedroom last night at about 1:00 in the morning, when i saw the motion detection light we have mounted on the outside of the house go on. where my childrens bedroom is it is right against a hillside that leads to very dense woods. anything can walk out of the woods and onto a small porch that we have off of my childrens bedroom. well, anyhow as i was saying, i was checking on them and there is a window that you can look out onto this porch {it is on the second floor, but up against the woods} and also a door for access.when the light came on i instinctively looked over to the window because i knew whatever had set it off would be either there on that porch or in the woods. it goes off if a raccoon or a cat scurries by so itis not uncommon for this to occur. when i looked over to that window i could not breathe. all i could see was a massive, coal black, very shaggy haired creature standing there on two very bulky legs looking in the window at me. i felt very frightened, as this window is only about 6 feet from where my childrens beds are. i could not see anything but the two legs and the rear end of this thing because the window has a blind on it that was halfway down. it is one of those straw blinds that you can see through partially. with the light shining behind this thing i could make out the perfect outline of it''s upper body. i am about 5 feet tall and this thing was, i am guessing, about 8 feet tall because it towered over the window. it just stood there for a brief moment and then went in the direction of the woods. i was too scared to go over to the window and look and see where it went. i took my children into my bedroom last night and i laid awake in fear all night.what i keep remembering is the muscles and the bulk in the legs. the rear end {the butt} also was quite muscular. and that ratty coal black fur. there was no smell at all and it made no noise. i am sure that the light coming on suddenly spooked it, but i got the impression that it was curious as to what was inside my home. it gives me the shakes to think of it. it was a cold winter night last night, but the ground was still muddy so i mustered up some courage this morning and went looking for tracks.i found some long slide marks on the hillside as if something had slid down the mud. no distinct footprints though.",

    " Two friends and I were backpacking on great north mountain in the winter of 2002. It was our second night and we reserved a stone cabin from the PATC, named sugar knob cabin, we had not seen anyone all day. There was an ice storm coming and we attributed it to that. We made a fire outside the cabin just before dusk while it was still nice out. We began to hear slow moving, very heavy footsteps walking around the perimeter of the location we were at. We thought it was a bear or a deer but it was clearly on two feet by the sounds it was making. We called out to see if it was a poacher or just someone walking around but no response was given. This is a pretty remote spot and definitely not very visited in the winter months. The walking sounds continued but because the sun was down by now we could not see too far into the woods. We all heard the walking sounds for quite a while and it really freaked us out so much so we abandoned the fire and pretty much locked ourselves into the cabin. All of us had a lot of outdoor experience and had backpacked a lot as well. We had never heard or experienced anything like this before. The sounds got closer once inside the cabin. It is a stone cabin so it is fairly well Insulated from noise. So whatever it was, was large. The footsteps seemed to stop and continue for maybe an hour or so. We made dinner inside and after we ate the footsteps were right next to the cabin, there was a window opposite the door with wood shutters on the blinds that were closed so I opened them expecting to see a person but we all witnessed a dark, very hairy large face looking at us about a foot outside the window. We were terrified, shaking and speechless. The creature took off after a few seconds of seeing us and vise versa. We never heard anymore sounds after that either. We stayed up all night, though just kind of standing guard. The next morning we awoke to ice everywhere and could not find any tracks or evidence of what we saw and heard. We hiked down the stony creek trail to the cars as fast as we could without getting hurt with the ice on the ground. There was a cabin journal at that time and we read it over that night after the incident and read several accounts that were similar to ours. We never stayed there again and this is the first time I have ever told this because I did not want people to think I was nuts or something.  ",

    " I always said I did not believe in bigfoot. I would say, I would have to see it to believe it. I love the woods and hunting. I spend as much time in these woods as possible and always have. I have never seen ANYTHING until now. I still have a hard time calling it a bigfoot. I have tried to rationalize it every way possible in my own mind. I can only come up with one conclusion; I saw and heard a \"Bigfoot\" It took me a long time to tell anyone other than my parents and wife. I know I have to report the sighting, so here goes.<BR><BR>It was Saturday night at 11:30 pm, on January the 13th. It was raining, at times hard. I was driving south on route 55, coming up on Seneca Rocks, towing a U-Haul trailer driving about 45 mph. I had passed the gas station on the right, then the school on the left. Next on the left there is a brick house the government owns but never seems to use. This is just before the entrance to the park and the intersection to head to Harman, the direction I was headed. Passing the house is where I saw it. At first I thought it was a man in a special forces outfit, some type of sniper gear. My first thought was what is he doing out there on a night like tonight dressed like that. <BR><BR>It was not really running more like a swaggering lope. It had long hair, what at first looked liked shredded material with clumps in it, hanging all off of its body. As I passed it I quickly noticed that it had this \"covering\" right up over its head. It seemed to have no neck, just a large head. I also realized it was very tall, and had very wide shoulders and its arms hung very low almost to its knees, if not below. <BR><BR>It was walking or sort of trotting on hind legs like a man, but with a movement like an ape. It was only 20 feet or so from me. I realized it wasn''t a man or anything else I had ever seen. I got a very good look at it. The whole thing still seems to have been in slow motion, It still plays in my head that way. In any case it hit me, what the Hell was that? I turned my truck trailer and all around within 50 yards right in the middle of the road. I pulled into the driveway and shined my headlights behind the house into the woods. I saw nothing. I pulled back onto the road and into the grass where I saw it. I stopped and shined my mag lite into the woods. <BR><BR>It really got spooky. I heard it going through the brush. It made the noise you would expect a large creature to make. Then it seemed to be trying to scare me or get a reaction out of me, the way a deer will stomp its feet at you when it can''t wind you. It made a type of laughing/squealing noise and a grunting noise. It pounded wood together, not a small piece hitting another piece. It was more of a large piece of wood being pounded on another large piece. This went on for 3 to 5 minutes then nothing. I was amazed. <BR><BR>The next day I went back and combed the area. All I found was what appears to be footprints I took and still have pictures of them. <BR><BR>What amazed me was, when I did go on the Internet on a friends advice, some other reported sightings were the similar including the sounds I heard. All this from people I do not know and from other areas of the country.",

    " It happened in 1989 on a hunting trip in the middle region of West Virginia. We were on our yearly deer-hunting trip in the remote mountainous area of Randolph County. I was about 24 years old and was in on leave from the military on the family-hunting trip. My family and friends have hunted this area for many years and I was very comfortable and familiar with the area. <BR><BR>The road back had not been traveled for years and was very washed out and overgrows with brush. It was about 7-8 miles back before we came to the impassable areas of the road and it was then that we geared up and proceeded on foot. I would estimate we had gone about another 2-3 miles on foot before we reached the crest of the mountain and decided to find our hunting spots. <BR><BR>The light had just begun to peek over the mountaintop when I cleared my spot and settled in. I had worked up a pretty good sweat on the steady pace up the mountain so it was not too long after setting and listening to the first morning light waking up the rest of the forest, I began to nod off to sleep. After going in and out a few times I decided to get up and move around a little to try to wake myself up. <BR><BR>After about 20 minutes of walking around I stumbled on a very old wooden tree stand. Although I could tell it had been there for many years, I remember thinking it was in the best spot overlooking the very visible and open woods just under the crest of the hilltop. Not too long after I ate the apples and oranges I had brought. After a while the warm morning sun took its toll on me and I nodded off again. <BR><BR>A bad smell woke me right up. The forest was completely quiet around me and all I could think of is what the hell that awful smell is? As I became more alert, I could hear the slight rustling below me and what I thought was some faint grunts and whines. I decided it was time to lean over and get a visual on it. <BR><BR>It was about 25 feet below me on the slope and directly in front of the stand. It was not aware of my presence above it. It was about 5 feet tall with long dark, reddish-brown hair. The hair from its head down its body was of equal length, about 2-3 inches long. The hair went down its arms and hands as well as its feet. I could barley see fingernails and toe nails. Not claws but nails like a human. <BR><BR>Most of its hair was tangled and matted in spots as if it had wallowed the ground or a tree or something. I watched it smelling the orange peels and apple core then tasting them. It looked around at one point as if to wonder where they may have come from. I wondered how long it would be before it became aware of my presence and what it would do when it did.<BR><BR>Then I heard the rustling coming down from the top of the hill, loud rustling, and I could tell something was coming at a pretty rapid speed. I saw the one below me turn and look in the direction of the noise. It froze for a few seconds and looked almost like a statue. <BR><BR>I could not see at this point what was coming down the hill. I was leaning to my right and looking down. I tried to move my eyes to the left but my view was blocked by the trees that was holding up my stand and partially by the full-brim hat I was wearing. I kept my eyes moving between the one below me and the direction of the disturbance coming down the hill.<BR><BR>As it moved toward our position it began to make noises like I have never heard before. I would ordinarily not be able to describe the noise but I have read where other people have described it as a record being played backward. I would have to say that is a very close description. It is as if it were speaking a language but nothing like I have ever heard before. <BR><BR>The one below me sprang to its feet and then moved about 15-20 feet to the right of me. It moved very rapidly, kind of between a run and a leap, all on its feet though. It did not use its arms. It then started to bellow back at the one coming down the hill and it sounded almost like they were arguing. That is the impression that it left me with anyway. <BR><BR>It wasn''t until the one above me came into clear view that I started to feeling very scared. As it came into my immediate area it moved toward the first one and began to slow to what seemed to be very cautious movements. Its attention seemed to move between the first creature and its surrounding area. I felt at this moment that it was alert to my presence. <BR><BR>This second one was much larger than the first and it seemed very irritated. The bigger one was covered in very dark hair, almost black. It was very muscular and its arms were noticeably long. It stood with a slight bend but an upright posture. I had to be about 8-9 feet tall. It was much larger than a human. <BR><BR>As these two creatures squabbled (communicated?) back and forth their gestures were extremely human-like. I was under the impression that the larger of the two was scolding the smaller one. <BR><BR>They moved about 40-50 feet to the right of me. At this point the larger one had its back to me I could make out facial features of the smaller one. It had very human-like features but a different nose. Hair covered most of its face but it looked to be thin hair, not like the rest of it. <BR><BR>Then the smaller creature spotted me because it went into a crouched and then squatting position and looked up in my direction. Their chattering began to quiet and then the larger one, with its back still to me, went into a squatting position for a few seconds. The smaller one then began to howl and bellow very loudly. The larger of the one, with its back still toward me began to howl very loud also. The larger creature then pushed the smaller one and the smaller one sprang to its feet and rapidly ran off across the hill to my right. It ran in long leaping strides and moved very fast like nothing I had ever seen. I never noticed it to ever look back. <BR><BR>As the smaller one ran the larger one stood up and slowly turned toward me. It had its arm bent above its forehead as if it were shading or hiding its eyes. It stood very straight and tall and looked directly at my tree stand. <BR><BR>All of the fear from before overcame me again and I prayed that thing did not try to come up my tree. I thought for an instant that I would yell at it, jerk or jump and maybe frighten it away but I could not bring myself to move. I could not even bat an eye. I could feel my legs starting to shake and I became very hot all over. For an instant I though I was going to pass out or become physically ill. <BR><BR>For a brief moment it was looking right at my face. From what I could see it had very large human-like eyes and very large round nostrils. I could not make out lips because of the hair on its face but I would guess that they were thin lips because the hair did not stick out. It did not have much of a protruding mouth or jaw like an ape. It had a flat fairly face like a human. <BR><BR>It put its arm to its side and began to look around. It swiveled at the hips and looked in every direction. After a quick glance back at me it then began to walk off in the direction the smaller one had gone. It did not run or act scared at all. It made very long howls as it walked and turned a few times and looked in my direction as it walked away. <BR><BR>I watched it and listened until it became just a black figure moving through the woods. I could here it howl and bellow for a few more minutes. Then I heard what sounded like something beating a tree or log with a limb or stick or something. <BR><BR>After about 30 minutes I decided that if it meant to do me harm, it sure had the chance, and it was probably safe to get down out of the tree stand. I made my way back toward my friend that I had left earlier that morning. I never even thought to check the ground for evidence or anything. <BR><BR>After about an hour I walked up on my friend and could see his blaze orange through the trees. I very carefully made my way in his direction. As I approached him I could see that he was staring at me. He was sitting against some downed trees and he did not move a muscle. As I walked closer to him I smiled and asked him if he had seen anything. He was very pale and I could tell he was a little scared and puzzled and then he answered to me the he was not sure what he had saw. <BR><BR>I jokingly said, You look like you saw a Bigfoot! and he jumped to his feet and asked, Did you see it? <BR><BR>I nodded to him, yes, then he began to tell me what he saw. Apparently the larger creature had moved across the hill in front of him crashing through the trees about 40 to 50 yards away. He said at first he thought it was a bear but after observing it, he could plainly see that it was moving very fast and walking up right, like a man. <BR><BR>I said we should try to track the two creatures but it really didnt take too much for him to talk me out of it. <BR><BR>This really happened, 16 years ago in Randolph County, West Virginia.",

    " I was 21 and had just returned about 6 months before from living in japan for 2 years. The general season mule deer hunt had just opened and i decided to go hunting one day after my college classes had ended, i remember thinking how stupid it was that i had to  go to class during the hunt and didn''t want to while i driving/sliding my car up a snowy road. <BR><BR>i turned off the paved road onto a farm road and went past a house that was under construction and parked in the small trailhead lot. instead of going up the mountain i walked a short distance around a field and sat down on a steep slope overlooking a valley, a few hills and some trees. <BR><BR>i sat looking through my binoculars at the deer bedded down in the trees wondering why they wouldn''t get up and forage in the trees for nuts or grasses. as i sat watching i heard a loud crashing sound coming from the trees nearer to the house/ barn that was being built, it may have even been watching them as it was very close to the house. <BR><BR>i looked through my binoculars and could see a large black shape moving through heavy cover and at first thought it was a black bear but as i watched it didn''t have the bouncing motion that bears have when they run because their front legs are shorter than the rear legs. it was moving very gracefully. <BR><BR>i watched as it plowed through thick brush like a bull until it made it to more open ground in the trees and noticed how strange it really was. it was moving on two legs and moving fast. i looked and saw all the deer running. unfortunately it was in the other direction and turned back to the animal. <BR><BR>i watched in amazement was it went straight into a massive stand of buck brush that i couldn''t have gotten through with a machete.<BR>it kept moving at a phenomenal pace and was gone over a ridge in just a few seconds.<BR><BR>i''ve hunted and hiked alone for years and come toe to toe with both black bears and mountain lions and never, ever been that afraid before. i imnedeiatly put a bullet into my rifle and backed away from the spot, never turning my back. i got in my car and left. <BR><BR>my dad and brother and brother in law keep wanting to go back there because we''ve seen deer there but i have never gone back. even when i hunt the other end of the wellsville mountains i stay with someone because of the experience.<BR><BR>z",

    " I don''t know if what I saw was two bigfoots or something else, but one thing I know is they were things I''ve never seen before. I also know they weren''t bears. I worked in the coal mines near a small town called Amigo. What I used to do (my job description) was coal sampler. I would drive around all day collecting coal for chemical analysis, from the high walls to the deep mine. The deep mine is more remote since they just put the belt head in. It is so far from the plant to the deep mines it would take me about 30 to 35 minutes driving in the mountains. <BR><BR>Last week I was driving back from picking up a sample and noticed something running back up in the woods. It was two does. Then I noticed something was laying on the ground. I beeped my horn thinking it was a bob cat and up jumped this light tan (just a little bit darker than the deers skin) thing. <BR><BR>I froze. It was definitely wasn''t a man or bear. All I know is it was walking upright. It did something that looked like it clapped its hands.  Then I watched it kneel down and crawl into an airshaft for an abandonned mine.

    " Two winters ago at around 9:20p.m. I was coming back from dropping off the person I was dating at the time. The conditions were sleet and ice and I shouldn''t have even been driving, but there were news reports that we would be iced in within meer hours. I didn''t want to be trapped with this person at my home so I ventured forth into the night. He lived approxiamately thirteen miles away. To make a long story short, on my way back into my subdivision ,which is VERY rural, I came around a curve in the road. I was moving quite slowly because of the horrible weather when I slowed down even more because I saw a large ball of hair about the size of a large deer on the side of the road. I had my bright lights on the animal when it stood up, took two big steps, went over onto it''s knuckles and lunged into the woods. I screamed to my son \"Did you see that?!!!!!\" But he was sitting slouched down into the seat. I went to the house to get my father, his shotgun and his large truck. I made him drive back to where I had seen the- I will say animal. We drove all the way around the lake and around the entire subdivision in the sleet and ice because I just knew that he would see it too and I would have another witness. No animal. No witness. Just me. I was in tears. I was being told I''m stupid and all I saw was a deer or something. We were iced in for three days. I went back with someone else after the ice melted. THERE WAS ONE SINGLE SOLITARY FOOTPRINT. I SAW IT!!!!! I touched it!!!! I placed my own foot in it. Then I smashed the print unerneath my own. <BR>",

    "It was a deep, throaty, raspy \"growl\", over and over. The best way I can describe it would be to imagine dragging a file quickly and abruptly across the edge of a piece of corrigated tin. As it moved away, the sound continued, but was a little more intense. My impression, then and now, was that it was \"irritated\". I hear sounds I cannot identify regularly in these woods, but they would be hard to describe.I went back and called the area again the next day, but wasn''t looking for anything associated with a bigfoot-type animal.",

    " While predator calling this date, I was targeting bobcats with an electronic call. (I mention this because with this particular call, only a bobcat would be expected to respond. A fox, coyote, coon, etc. would not respond to this call.) After about 10 minutes of calling, I heard a sound from behind me that I could not identify. I was using a varmint light, which has a red filter. This light is not normally readily seen by predators. I shined the light toward the sound, and saw what I thought was a bear. It was dark in color, but everything was either light or dark because of the red filter. I have hunted in the West several times, and seen many bears. I initially thought that''s what this was. But as stated earlier, a predator does not respond (normally) to this light. But this animal did. It stood up and moved away very rapidly on it''s two \"hind\" legs. While on all fours, it appeared to be a bear. Upright, it appeared to be around 5-foot tall with a fairly large stride. I wasn''t able to notice any other details because of the light source and because of how quickly it moved off. Bears do not move great distances on their hind legs, and especially not rapidly. It made this sound continuously as it moved away, gradually decreasing in volume until I couldn''t hear it any longer.  I''m not sure what this was, but I''m quite certain what it was not, and it was not a bear, a hog, or any other animal native to this area. After a recent conversation with Daryl Colyer, he and Craig Woolheater encouraged me to make this report. I did not do so earlier because I simply had no idea there was a possiblilty this could have been a bigfoot-type animal. Should there be any follow-up, I''d like to request Daryl Colyer as the investigator. ",

    " I was delivering newspapers on a lightly snowing early morning in Novemeber of 2005. Id guess it was 4:30 or so, just before dawn. The roads were barely dampened. It was a very pretty almost wintry scene. The high Uintas range was behind me. I turned from highway 411 to highway 410, which takes one back into the town of Mountain View. There are no lightposts until you cross the bridge and drive maybe 1/4 or 1/8th mile. As I turned from hwy 411, I looked towards the first light, about a fourth mile away. It could have been 1/2 mile. There was something pretty big walking. It was walking toward me, and it looked like it was all one bulky thing- no coat or hat lines that I could see. It seemed to have its head pointed slightly downward. Not a lot, just a tad. It also seemed like its arms were slightly long. It didnt seem to be bothered by the cold or the light snow. It was just walking like it had somewhere it was going. It walked diagonally across the road, towards a clump of brushy trees. It seemed like it strode big, but not in a big hurry, but not a casual stroll, but it  crossed faster than a man. It walked on two legs but not exactly like a man...Ive seen moose, deer, elk, steers, skunks, foxes, one little bear, porcupines, you name it, but it wasnt any of these. <BR><BR>I got to where I had seen it go into the brush area, and there was nothing. There wasn''t a roadway where it had crossed, being in between two ranch houses, located farther in than where this thing was. Being an isolated area at that time in the morning, I slowed to see if I could see anything like if it had been a person for some crazy reason out for a walk there at that time of morning, and it was a bit cold. I figured if it was a person, Id see it walking on one of the ranch house roads, but no, nothing was there. <BR><BR>I felt pretty uneasy, so I continued to drive home. The area there is pretty, with a river running East and West just before where I saw that larger than a man thing. It may have been between 7 to 9 feet tall, but I''m estimating with the size of the lightpost, the trees it disappeared in, things like that. I couldn''t see if it was black or brown, but it didn''t seem dark enough to be black. <BR><BR> Years ago in the early eighties we had lived in Lyman, six miles past Mountain View. We had a dog, as a lot of our neighbors did. One night while my husband was on graveyard shift, the dogs raised a ruckus. It was a pretty moonlit night I think in summer. Or almost fall. But I looked out my bedroom window and saw walking behind our house in the alley something really big, swinging its arms and seemed silently just striding past. I got so scared I pulled my covers over my head and didnt move for a long long time. My dog and others were howling. After a while things quieted down.   Way back I had a friend who had been driving up in the Uintas on the Utah side who claimed a bigfoot thing walked in front of their truck, stopped and looked at them, them continued on. This was I think in the late sixties to 70.  The Uintas are beautiful, and are probably  8 to twenty miles within distance of where I saw that thing in Nov of 2005.<BR><BR> I didnt hear anything when I stopped to look. If it was hiding in the bushes, it wasnt moving, because I didnt hear any limb cracking. But I did have a strong sense that something was staring at me. I normally see a deer or two in that area, but I dont think I saw any that morning, I dont recall for sure. For awhile I would go through that area (still having to deliver papers) feeling like something watched me at times.  I''m pretty spooked by this whole thing.",

    " The following was a sighting by my Father. It was about 1972 or 73''. First of all he told me that he had never heard of such sightings before. As my brother and I got a little older we started reading up on Bigfoot sightings and stories in books when we were still about 8 and 10 years old. Anyway, we learned that there had been sightings in the same area as my Father''s after his, and he never knew anything about these reports. My Father is an avid outdoorsman and he is far from one who would fabricate something of this magnitude. All he can say to us is that he was deer hunting, in what is very remote country and still is today, and he was up on a mountain ridge. He said he saw something that at first glance he thought was a bear, but as he looked a little longer he realized that it wasn''t. Keep in mind that he hadn''t ever heard of Bigfoot before. I''m not sure how long the sighting lasted, but he said that it walked too far too long to be a bear. He said that it stopped and started messing with a tree limb and then turned and walked over the other ridge and never saw it again that day. He has not hunted there anymore since. His sighting happened before the others that made local news. I would also like to comment on the sighting that happened in Uwharrie National Forest. My Father, brother, and I hunt there and there is no doubt in my mind that the report made for that is true simply because there is so much remote country there. Not only on the Natl. Forest, but all the private land as well.",

    "I had went and hung a stand on a tree the day before,for hunting deer. In an area around north sardis lake on public land.I knew I was the only person in there, because of the trails hadnt been used for some time.I rode in about 2 miles in and then walked about 300 yards to where I had hung my climber. It was just about day break, Iwas 20 or so feet up a pine tree when I heard what sounded like someone beating a stick against a tree. I spotted some movement in the area the sound came from,What ever it was was brown and tall,my first thought was its a bear.I was using my binoculars,but it was about 200 yards from me and dawn.So I pulled up my rifle to look threw the scope,hoping I could see it better.It wasnt any bear, it didnt have ears on top of its head and its face was flat. It was at least 8 foot tall and stood like a man.and I noticed its skin was grayish/green where the hair was thin. I was so startled I stood up.It turned toward my direction and knew I was there.It leaned Its head back as if smelling the air, then took off. It move 40 or so yards in a few seconds and was gone.I was shaking badly and climbed straight down.I just coundnt beleive what I had seen.So I started walking in the direction I had seen it.I walked over to a hill where it had slid and left a track. It was a human looking foot track.This scared me because I was trying to tell myself, it was just a bear,then a sound came from the woods that sounded like whoop...whoop.So I hurried back got my stand and left those woods. That has been six years ago, and everytime I told anyone my story. They made fun of me, so I been reserved about letting anyone know, but recently.A freind f mine had an encounter,he doesnt want to let anyone know.Because he thinks people will think hes crazy...

    " Unfourtunately, I have no video or audio, only personnel observation. The first encounter did not involve a sighting. As a young boy, I was out on the front porch with my mother, father, uncle, and grandfather. At around 9:00 pm, we all heard a sound that was not unlike a shrill human scream. Untill that night, I did not know what it meant to have your hair stand on end. A somewhat large dog that we had outside barked, cried, and ran away in apparrent terror. The only thing we found the next day was a single partial footprint. <BR><BR>The next encounter happened when my cousin and I were in the woods fishing at a pond on our grandfathers property. We first noted a very strong odor that we took to be a skunk. We then heard a sound like a scream, a few grunts, then nothing. Before the next encounter, there were some unusual incidents that deserve mentioning. First was the finding of dead livestock, mainly pigs. They almost always had been found with their liver and heart removed. I never saw this myself, only heard the stories. I did see on at least two ocassions all of the fruit eaten off of trees on the property. In both cases, all of the fruit was removed from the trees, and the pits on the ground around the tree. We laughed about the belly ache something would have from eating an entire tree of green pears. <BR><BR>Later, as a teenager, I was alone in the woods. I had the distinct feeling I was being watched. I crossed a barbwire fence near the road, crossed the road and entered the woods there. When I returned to the road a short time later, 20-30 minutes, I saw that the fence I had earlier crossed, had been partially knocked down. Upon approaching the damaged fence, I noticed several \"large\" footprints. They appeared human in every respect except for their size. Even then, I wore a size 12D boot, the prints were at least two to three inches longer and maybe two inches wider than my boot. The tracks led first to the road, then back into the woods. <BR><BR>Maybe a year later, a friend and I were in the woods. He was from New Orleans, LA, and knew nothing of the past encounters. While near a creek bottom, he suddenly froze and ask me what was watching us. I stood near him and saw what I first thought was a bear about 25 yards away. It was in a squating position. It then stood upright. It was, I''m sure, seven to eight feet tall. The creature was covered with very dark brown hair over it''s entire body, with the exception of it''s face. It stood upright like a man, not stooped like a bear. As we departed the area, we watched it follow us. The creature had a long stride and it''s arms swung as it walked. It followed us to the edge of the wood line. The only sounds it made were whistling noises. <BR><BR>My next and last encounter did not occur until I was in the army. A co-worker and I went to the old house to do some shooting. We arrived late that night. As we sat outside talking, we saw a large man shaped creature walk accross the road about 125 yards away. It walked into the woods and disappeared. It did not seem to notice us. <BR><BR>",

    :otherstories
    "In the fall of 99 my brother was going to hunt deer in our woods and told me he was going to build a blind down by the swamp in the south west of our 20 acres. An hour or so later I walked back there to see how he was doing. I heard what sounded like logs being thrown around and I thought it to be strange, like what the hell is he building. The area is real thick with under growth and trees both living and dead so to get my direction straight I hollered his name. The sound stopped and I hollered several times only to hear silence. I remember feeling odd at that time. I continued forward into the swamp, I was looking down to avoid tripping on debri and I saw for only a second something big move across in between two big bush type trees in front of me. It didn''t make hardly any noise though, it was very light on it''s feet not like you would think for something of it''s size. So this part of my story is just odd, not like an actual sighting. But I do believe (what I saw in February) was a bigfoot. Also a contractor that built a pole building for us told me in a conversation that he hunts an awfull lot north of us a few miles where there is a big swamp. I asked him if he had seen anything unusual while hunting. He replied just what are we talking about. I replied \"you know\" have you seen anything that let''s say \"should''nt be there. He replied no but said that his brother-in-law saw a big hairy ape going under some under brush while he was hunting deer. It was pitch black and was on all fours. Just like an ape would move about. Except he said it was much bigger than any ape he''d seen at the zoo. He told me how he ridiculed his brother-in-law, as did his brother in law''s wife. Two weeks later his wife saw the thing out a window of their house. She didn''t laugh any more. I don''t know what else to add to this at this time but will be glad to answer questions.",

    " Ok, I Have decided to tell you my story after much thought. I do not want any media involved please.  My wife and I purchased our home near Kingston, Michigan in Febuary of 1999.  We were having coffee in the morning on a weekend, date I cannot recall but it was shortly after, still in February.  As we were having our coffee I was looking off into the woods behind our home and saw a tall pitch black \"ape\" walking from south to the north.  It was erect, however slightly leaning forward, not straight up.  It''s arms were long and just kinda swinging loosely as it passed.  It traveled about twenty feet in my view.  I saw only it''s right side.  My wife did not see it and it is really hard for her to take me serious.  I don''t blame her though.  There was some snow on the ground but very scant.  No foot prints.  Ground was frozen.  I was going to investigate packing my 9mm but took something with more power because this thing was huge. <BR><BR>",

    " Me and three of my friends were coon hunting.  We were sitting around waiting on the dogs to strike and we heard something rustling in the leaves behind us.  It was a bright night out and we were right on the bank of the Hatchie River.  In the direction that we heard the noise was a small bluff and then went into an open field.  Due to the brightness of the moon it almost looked like daylight in that field.  When we turned to see what was making the noise we saw the monster on the edge of the field.  All we could see was a perfect outline of the creatures body.  It was very fast on it''s feet.  We never saw it stand still.  The first time we turned around we saw it run across the edge of the field, faster than any other animal could run.  Everyone was shocked and was asking one another if they saw it too.  Seconds later it ran across again, this time it went from upright to all fours and back upright, it never broke stride.  It appeared to be about 6''5\" to 8'' tall and weigh about 225 to 275lbs.  It was hairy but not like you see in \"bigfoot\" movies.  It was very agile and robust. <BR>",

    " November 15-19.  Witness: James Scott. HUNTING. <BR><BR>Heard:  During the night (whole trip) <BR>-Heard what appeared to be loud squirrel barks and trees being knocked down during the middle of the night.  <BR>-Something running around the tent.  (Thought it was coyotes <BR>chasing three wild kittens that were hanging around the campground.)<BR>-Something was moving the items around in the back of Scotts pick-up truck.  <BR>-Tree Knocks in the night coming from three different locations around the lake (first just one knock bouncing back and forth then two knocks).<BR>-On the third night I was growled at while placing the park camping fee registration in the box.<BR>-Constant sounds of something dropping heavy objects in the lake.<BR>During the night and while hunting<BR>-Heard constant what appeared to be owl hoots coming from different locations around the lake.  These hoot sounds followed us where ever we hunted.<BR>-On the morning we were packing up our camp site an old man stopped his truck next to our site and spoke with us about different topics.  During the conversation he stopped abruptly and pointed to the forest next to us and said he saw a man walk in the forest wearing all black.  This area is all marsh and difficult to walk.  When I looked I didnt see anything. <BR> <BR>Saw:  Discovered while hunting an elaborate curious landscaping in a forested area near a dam that sits adjacent to two lakes.  It appeared in this landscaping well gardened plant on rotting or decayed trees.  One pile of trees contained a pile of seeds neatly arranged in the open on top surface of one the trees.  <BR>- There was also a vine of thorns (like a fence) circling one area containing a growth of plants on an arranged pile of decaying trees (similar to Bermuda lawn grass).  The plants were well groomed and did not match the other trees that contained only moss. <BR>-One large slanted tree held the same plant growth and appeared to cover half of the tree.  This plant growth was not located on any other trees in the immediate area.  <BR>-A canvass three tree structure that stood seven feet high and was interwoven at the top of the structure.<BR>-The place reminded me of a well cared for garden.     <BR>-A stream with muddy banks split the forested areas between the two lakes in observation.  On one side of the banks were several sets of what appeared to be human hand prints leaving out of the water.  The arrangement of the prints appeared to emulate that the position of its body is in the water and the trunk of the body was supported by the arms as it was searching the embankment.  All of the prints appeared to possess an inch to two inch pointed claws.  No foot prints were discovered at all.  No evidence of any animal leaving the waters edge. <BR>-In the night-I shined a flash light and observed two very large and round orange eyes in the forest near our tent.  The eyes were situated about six feet above the ground.  These eyes moved several times during the period that I shined my light.  I measured the distance the following morning by comparing the height of the eyes to a tree that was near the spot. <BR>-Other observations include a bedding area that appeared to contain at one time two animals five to six feet in length.  The area was in a tall grass space within a heavily forested area.  Both places appeared to be something that was sleeping in a fetal position.  Next to the bedding area was a four inch wide by six inch tall make shift lean to that contained at one time a small fire.  The charred items within the lean to were small branches and dried grass.     <BR><BR>December 6-10, 2010.  Witness: Chris  HUNTING <BR><BR>First night: (Sunday)<BR>-Chris and I were the only campers in the campground. <BR>-While using the outhouse, I heard hooting from across the lake, an animal next to the outhouse responded to the hooting by responding with a chimp rant changing tone to what resembled a samurai chatter, then ending in a deep guttural sound.  (The event reminded me of a kid telling his mom, I am here at the campground!)  Something opened and closed the door on the female side of the outhouse.  I immediately called Chris to come toward the outhouse.<BR>-Placed three apples on an empty campsite''s picnic table as a lure.  The apples were never touched.<BR>-Shined my flash light into the adjacent forest and located two very large eyes in the forest.  They appeared to be six feet above the ground.  The set of eyes changed from two eyes to one eye as the figure appeared to turn and walk toward the lake.  <BR>-About an hour into retiring for the evening.  Someone appeared to be fanning our extinguished camp fire.  I heard the wood that was left in the fire pit being moved around in the pit.  I heard the occasional clinking of the wood against the metal barrier.<BR>-I saw what appeared to be a kitten lifted and placed against the tent.  The paws were off the ground and not on the tent siding too high above the ground. All - -- All night something was unzipping and zipping the tent.<BR>-Someone was dropping heavy objects into the lake all night.<BR>-Heard what appeared to be a very big squirrel run around the tent in deep leaves all night.<BR>-Knocking throughout the night once on a metal sign or something.<BR><BR>Following morning: (Monday)<BR>-Back window of my GMC Envoy mud splattered with a Z form and a palm print.  No finger prints.<BR>-Because I was kept up all night - I mimicked several times loudly a hysterical laugh and owl hoots to tease the animal who kept me awake all night. <BR>-Park attendant told us that a previous camper told him that, you have Sasquatches in these forests.<BR>-On other side of lake - saw a black figure run into the campground that appeared to come out of the lake. <BR>-Hunted near a concrete damn on the lake.  Heard some animal crying Maaaw-Maaaw-Maaaw.  Sounded like a bear cub but more like a southern country boy. <BR>-At dusk, while heading toward the outhouse, Chris heard an animal mimic my hysterical laugh in the woods next to the outhouse.<BR>-Dusk to late night I heard an animal constantly running in the woods.  Sounded like a very large squirrel. <BR>-Rock thrown at new campers twice when they left to buy beer.  The sound of the rocks hitting the trees and camping gear were a large audible crack.<BR>-When the new campers placed firewood in their pit, the wood lit up immediately.   <BR>Their site had been empty for over 48 hours.  <BR>-Owl hooting sounds all night.  Not exactly like owls really sound.  <BR>-Heavy objects being thrown in the water all night.<BR>-Someone was tapping our coleman lantern glass cover that was 6 feet off the ground hanging on a metal pole.<BR>-Playing with tent zipper all night again. <BR>-Running around tent in leaves.<BR>-Around (0400am) I was awakened by three quick, heavy and deep exhales right outside of tent next to me.<BR><BR>Tuesday: (duck hunters) Started duck taping the zipper inside the tent.<BR><BR>- I again mimicked a hysterical laugh and owl hoot to tease the animal who kept me awake all night. <BR>-Come duck hunters who came in late at night said they saw eyes in the far corner of lake, while they were hunting in the early morning.<BR>-The duck hunters said something was hitting their camper truck during the night, they believed it was coyotes.<BR>-I was growled at in the night placing money into the payment box again, like I was in November. <BR>-Was growled at on the far side of the lake while looking for an entry point into a heavily wooded section of the forest. <BR>-On the same far side of the lake I noticed several tin cans of food scattered along a five foot stretch along the path.  Upon further examination of one of the tin cans I noticed several tooth punctures into the can on both the lid and sides of the can.  U shaped like a large human bite.  The teeth marks itself were circular and large in form and shape like a dog/canine teeth would leave.   <BR>-Chris and I found an orange ball cap on the trail on our return trip back to the campsite.  There wasnt one on the way into the woods.  Chris and I asked all campers - no one admitted ownership.<BR>-Heard the Maaw-Maaw again in the woods around the campground.<BR>-At night I heard a car honk its horn on the main road outside of the campground - when the car horn ceased, I heard beep-beep in the woods.  Sounded like the voice characterization of the road runner on the cartoons.  <BR>-Dusk to late night I heard an animal constantly running in the woods.  Sounded like a very large squirrel. <BR>-Early in the morning heard noises around my vehicle.  Activate automatic locks on my car, activating the vehicle to honk its horn.  Something then appeared to run across our campsite. <BR><BR>Wednesday: (eight foot)<BR><BR>-Chris saw an eight foot Bigfoot fifty yards from the tent.  Just stood there swaying side to side at his hip.  Chris said the shoulders were broad and had a V shape starting from his shoulders and ending at his waist.  I stood next to the tree the following morning.  Chris said the head was as high as the branch that stood eight feet off the ground.<BR>-New campers set a tent right next to the tree where the Bigfoot was seen.<BR>-Something threw a rock at Chris and me while we were around the fire.  The rock hit an exhausted fire ash pile next to the fire pit. <BR>-Hunters next to us claimed to have seen a person in all black through his rifle scope, stand up and walk into heavily a wooded area.  The person in black was well over 200 yards away. <BR>-It rained all night - our camp site smelled like a wet dog.  <BR>-Something was dragging a stick on the sides of our tent, occasionally tapping the stick like a drum beat against the siding of the tent.<BR>-Had to use port-a potty in the tent - when the lid of the potty hit the vinyl of the tent heard foot steps advance toward our tent, stop right outside the tent, and appeared to adjust its weight.  (Seemed like the animal was curious to hear what was going on inside the tent).  I seen no images against the tent.  Too dark. <BR>-No running animal sounds in the leaves this night. <BR><BR>Thursday: (On all fours) <BR>-Around 0400am in the morning some animal was throwing around stuff in the back of the truck owned by the campers in the site next to us.  Something then pounded on the sides of the truck like a drum.  I heard one of two hunters stir inside their tent and yell, you dirty Indians!<BR>-Saw a large human foot print in a gravel sandy bank while hunting a fire break during the day.  The foot print was three inches larger than my 9 boot.<BR>-At dusk saw a pair of large vertical eyes at the base of the tree where Chris saw the eight foot Bigfoot.  The eyes moved behind the tree.  I turned off the flash light and turned it back on and saw a Bigfoot running on all fours from the tree where I saw the eyes to moving in a direction toward the lake.  The Bigfoot appeared to have a strange shape to it.  The head in reference to its back appeared totally straight.  The head was constantly affixed in one position - looking directly at the ground as it moved forward.   The body appeared slender and I could distinctly see the shape and muscle tone of the shoulders and legs.  It looked human but the head had a large crown and its eyes were large and black.  The mouth was very close to the chin and the lips appeared to be very straight.  I could distinctly see the skin through the hair.  It appeared to be grayish pink.  <BR>-More hooting and water splashes.<BR><BR>Friday:    <BR><BR>-In the mornings I normally stored my car keys to the GMC in the vehicles gas cap access area.  On this particular day when exiting the tent to cook breakfast, I noticed that the gas cap compartment door was open.     <BR>",

    " Several Bigfoot were observed with binoculars in a deeply wooded area. They were dodging in/out of the tree line, like a game of cat and mouse, with each other. Thought it was a hoax being played on me and just watched them move closer in my direction. We also heard some cackling noises in the distance that I likened to hyenas or coyotes. Separate from these noises were dogs barking in the area. Horses in the area that became real jumpy. After walking into wooded area, we disturbed a large creature that let out a very deep and loud growl that I''ve never heard any animal make before and we heard a loud thud like a heavy animal jumping. Shots from a .45ACP handgun were fired in the vicinity followed by heavy footsteps and branches/brush being disturbed by the same heavy animal making a hasty retreat. We went into the same distance and reached a creek bed area. There was dead silence and we noticed some smudged prints near the water''s edge but didn''t hear a splash or any other noise. We got the feeling that we were being watched and feared that whatever we were following had doubled back on us and might corner us with our backs to the water. By this time, it was darker outside but in the more open areas you could see without a flashlight. As we were leaving the area, we heard very heavy footsteps and stomping along with tree branches crashing to the ground that I likened to a bull dozer without the engine rushing behind us. We got to a clearing and turned to face whatever it was and saw a HUGE, silver-grayish colored Bigfoot just at the tree line. It was in the 10 O''clock position from where we were and it was stomping and \"bluff charging\" or \"mock charging\" at us and throwing branches. The trees in this area were middle growth to mature trees and he (appeared to be male by the aggressive nature and sheer size...) was rattling these trees with no problem! We squatted down to get a better look and to take aim at him in case he charged. He stayed within the tree line and rocked back and forth like a gorilla. The only sounds that were heard, at this point, were the stomping and the branches being thrown at us. He was about 20 yds. away from us and the large branches were coming very close. I had the gun aimed right at him and I''m convinced that he had a better sighting on me than I had on him because he reacted just like a squirrel on a tree does. I was thinking about taking a shot at him when suddenly from the 12 O''clock position, we noticed another Bigfoot that was shorter than he was and wasn''t as thick, up top, and appeared to be female because of (her) actions. The larger one(10 O''clock position) was at least 8 or 9 feet tall and was very massive in the shoulder areas. The smaller one(12 O''clock position) was at over 7 feet tall and was standing there rocking back and forth, but not as violently as the larger one. (seemed like she was following his lead and waiting to see what he would do next....) As long as I pointed the gun in their direction or shined a flashlight at them, they stayed behind the trees and tried to hide their faces. It became a sort of hide-n-seek as I shined the light to see their faces. I did catch a glimpse and the face appeared more sloth-like, from what I saw. They had BIG heads, the eyes were dark looking despite the growing darkness and flashlights. On one, I did notice a sort of frowned expression on the face and it almost looked sad. At this point, I couldn''t shoot because I wasn''t sure that it still wasn''t a hoax, although I understood what I was looking at. Also, it almost seemed like they could almost understand things more than other animals. (I won''t say they were thinking and reasoning.....) But, it was as if they were upset that I shot at them and was asking me \"WHY?\" The larger one (10 O''clock position) became more agitated and wanted us out of the area and began to stomp more and more, so we decided to slowly back out of the area (with gun pointed in their direction) and leave. As soon as we got out of the area, we then heard what I likened to a loud shouting type of horse whinnying shout. That I labeled their victory call, for running us out of the area. I had a camera hanging from my neck but didn''t touch the camera until I got home and noticed it hanging from my neck! I was very much afraid and wasn''t sure if I''d make it out of there alive or not. ",

All of a sudden from the left side of the field a huge man like creature that was covered in hair was running out of the woods across the field, it turned and looked up our way for a second then jump a barb wire fence (with no problem). The fence was running towards the house through the middle of the field...and continued to run in behind the pond. The last thing that I remember seeing was he ducked to avoid a tree limb as he was running into the woods.....The field was 250-300 yards wide and as he ran from side to side was about 100-150 yards off. <BR><BR>[Taken from email correspondence with the witness:] My cousin still gets chills when we talk about the thing we saw. As far as pictures provided by BFRO and other movies and books, that is what we saw. We was both very scared at that time.

I would start to work about dark and finish up right before daylight or sometimes a little earlier. I did this in Gregg, Rusk, Panola, Smith and surrounding counties. I don''t remember the roads because we hauled so many different leases that my memory fails me. In the wee hours of a cool foggy morning in December I had loaded and was on my way out of the lease. We were required to open and shut the gate on these leases because of livestock and public safety. Our trailers had bright lights for seeing how to back up at night and I always turned them on when I closed gates. Just as I closed the gate and locked it, I saw something step out of the woods and onto the lease road. It paused a minute and continued on across the lease road. My blood ran cold and every hair on my body stood on end. It was only about 30 feet from me, I could see it''s breath in the cold night air. If bigfoot exists, this is what I saw.

    " My girlfriend and I were parking at the edge of a creek flowing into the back of the lake. It was dark and under the cover of trees where we were parked you could not see your hand in front of your face. We had the windows cracked little and were in the back seat of the car when we heard something out of the ordinary. We had been there before so knew the usual night sounds in the area. A owl lived in the big tree near by and hooted all the time. The hill in front of the car went down to a swamp with a creek in the middle going to the lake. There was crickets, frogs and locust all making there normal sounds that night. But we heard something coming through the leaves in the bottoms, it sounded like it was heading to our car. I have spent a lot of time in the woods hunting, fishing and trapping growing up so I don''t get spooked to easy. At first I thought it was a cow, but then we noticed all the night sounds were gone, no frogs, crickets, owl - dead quiet except the foot steps. They were on 2 feet a step and a drag step like it had a hurt foot or something. Then being a kid I thought of all the horror movies I watched and figured it was a guy who jumped the train and was coming to kill us and take our car. As the steps got closer I got really bugged, it was coming up the hill right at the car. Finally after what I thought was an eternity I flew over the front seat and started the car, the only problem was it was a new car she just bought and I never drove it. She was screaming about dieing or something when I threw it in reverse and stomped the gas. I was there before and new the road opened up behind me so as I was going backwards I hit the light switch. This was a big mistake because it turned out to be the cigarette lighter, as soon as we came out of the tree cover we got some moonlight and I found the headlight switch. <BR><BR>This all happened really quick, but I looked up and there was this animal leaping over the hill going into the creek, it was really wide at the shoulders and had almost no neck. I thought at first it was a bear but there was not any bears in this area. I saw a big brownish black creature running through the trees. I saw two shoulders and the back of the head go between two trees, later measured to be about 4.5 feet apart. It covered between them easily. I asked my girlfriend did you see that, she said she saw a brown spot in the lights like a bear on two legs. <BR><BR>I think the car scared it, so we went to town for help. After we got more people, truck''s with lights and some equipment we came back. We left the truck lights shining in the bottoms and looked around for tracks with our flashlights. We started to look for footprints, the ground was dry and covered with leaves but we did find large scrapes going up the hill to where the car was parked, they looked like it was where the animal jumped over the hill. They were very far apart, I had to stretch as far as I could from the one on the bottom to the one at the top. I am 6'' 4\" with a 38\" inseam, this was a large stride. <BR><BR>This is when the whole woods went quiet again, it was nuts, 5 pretty big guys all standing in a circle like a herd of buffalo back to back, scared I guess, none of us moved a muscle. Flashlights and guns pointed out at the dark we listened to the dead quiet of the woods. Then all of a sudden a tree limb snaps - loud, and then everything gets back to normal. Then one by one the frogs, crickets, owls all started making noise again. Really strange night for sure. <BR><BR>The next day my brother and a friend went to walk the creek with buckshot in our shotguns. We walked about a half mile down the creek spread out like small game hunting. We came to the area where the railroad tracks were up on the hill, my brother was at the bottom, I was in the middle, my friend was on the end farthest from the hill. Then we heard a lot of racket and looked over to my brother, he yelled my name in a really scared voice as something was going up over the hill. I remember seeing trees bending back as if being used to help something get up and over the top. When I got to where my brother was he was on one knee and had his gun pointed up at the hill. I said what was it and he said I DON''T KNOW, BUT IT WAS BIG. We found 2 marks on the really steep bank going up to the railroad tracks, I tried to climb it and could not. The marks were in the middle of the hill and at the top, something very strong and powerful went up the hill. It had a big stride also. The hill was about an 80% incline.",

The sounds were very scary! They began as I walked up the hill, and stopped as I was leaving. And I did leave, after listening to these strange and almost eerie noises for about three minutes.

    " I was cutting through the College''s small managed forest to get to work. It was early evening, but midwinter, so very dark. I was raised in upstate NY, and felt comfortable hiking in familiar woods alone at night, even though female, and I knew the trail well. It cut from the main campus near the track and ended in a small corn or wheat field bordering a quiet avenue about 40-60 acres away. <BR><BR>The night was dark. There was no moon, yet my way was faintly lit by starlight, reflected on about 6 inches of old snow. About a third of the way through the woods I became aware of the sound of twigs breaking behind me and to my left about twenty yards or so. <BR><BR>At first I thought it was a dog, or fox, because the animal was following me at a steady pace, but keeping really quiet, and off the trail just inside the cover of the trees. This made me uneasy because there had been reports of rabid \"coy-dogs\" in the area, so I quickened my pace a little, keeping track of the animal, expecting it would lose interest and meander off somewhere else in the woods. <BR><BR>But it didn''t. Instead, it seemed to quicken its pace, too, and its sounds became louder, like it was kicking up leaves and snow and breaking not twigs but branches. I thought: \"This is some weirdo stalking me!\" Yet, the \"weirdo\" still didn''t show \"his\" face, but kept pace with me. My ears tried to place where it was in the black woods, but the lack of light meant I was restricted to sound only.<BR><BR>I guess I was afraid to run from \"him\", fearing \"he\" would most certainly catch up with me, so I decided to pretend I was unaware. At this point, I had about one third of the trail left to cover, and my follower was keeping pace with me, walking like a fairly large person through the woods judging by the sounds I was hearing. \"His\" distance was approximately 15-20 feet away from me, but I still hadn''t seen anything.<BR><BR>Up until now I had just been looking out of the corners of my eyes, not willing I guess to turn my head for fear of what I might see. I admit it. And when I did turn my head, just slightly, as we kept walking together, what I saw really kind of changed my perception of reality.<BR><BR>I saw a blocky, dark and very tall moving object working its way through the woods next to me. I could hear breathing. I could see it moving, but I could not tell what it was. I could feel my brain growing new dendrites trying to handle the reality of what I was seeing! It couldn''t, though, not really. In my mind I was                thinking, \"Well, it''s not human, so it must be some kind of spirit or something.\"<BR><BR>I really did not know what it was, and until a few months ago when I discovered your pages I guess I would not admit to myself what I had experienced. But I revisited the experience recently, and let myself kind of relive it, and remembered it in full. <BR><BR>I do not know if this \"being\" was a Bigfoot. There was no smell.  I did not see a face or arms. Only the bulky body and occasional shadows that looked like legs walking. I was too scared to look closely, really. We walked together the rest of the way through the woods, and I was the most scared when coming to the edge of the woods--I felt like if \"it\" was going to grab me it would be here. I was also scared of seeing \"it\" I think. <BR><BR>So at the very edge of the woods, I bolted. I ran about 3/8 mile and my feet never touched the ground. I ran into the nearest fast food place and caught my breath.  Whatever was following me never came out of the woods, and I have never told anyone this story until now, because the idea of a 10 foot monster following you through the woods sounds like a kid''s nightmare. <BR><BR>",

It was winter, but I dont'' remember exactly what month, but it was 1995 or so. <BR><BR>We had a very big snowstorm that night and it had been snowing for a very long time and there was about a foot or two of snow on the ground at the time.

I couldn''t believe it(he never did that and he certainly isn''t afraid of any local animals or people, infact, he loves to chase deer and such, if he can--so now, I was really petrified).<BR><BR>I worked up the nerve to look around the best I could with the limited lighting I had on a dark, snowy night, and Could not believe what I saw. I looked straight ahead in the direction of my driveway and saw these eyes looking at me! They were glowing you know like an animals''. They were very high in the air and I stood there for a moment just staring directly at them, (i think i was almost in shock-definitely scared)<BR><BR>In that minute or so, many thouhgts ran through my mind like, \"what IS that?\" \"it can''t be a deer, because I certainly made plenty of noise to scare it off, and why would a deer be out and about in this storm and not bedded down somewhere?\" \"it''s looking right at me! and it''s not scared one bit--why is it not leaving?? and the scariest thing was my dog''s reaction to it. \"if it was a deer, my dog would have chased it gladly, but he was afraid!\" \"what IS that?\" \"Am I imagining this?\" , \"I knew something was watching me!\". etc..<BR><BR>As scared as I was, I wanted to be SURE I was seeing what I thought I was seeing, so I blinked a few times and strained to get a better look at the outline of the body, but all i could really see was a definite big pair of glowing eyes on a tall thing. Then, absolute terror overtook me, and I ran into the house in a panic, and in desperation, called my grandpa and told him and he told me I was nuts and it had to be a deer.<BR><BR>I don''t believe that for a minute. I''ve seen many deer, they''re all over around here,and I am almost certain it was not a deer! I wish it hadn''t snowed so much that night because I have no way to go out and check for any kind of prints and I certainly wasn''t gonna go out then and walk right up to it, so I can''t tell you what it was.<BR><BR>I should tell you the distance from where I was to where the  \"thing\"  was was approximately 25 or so feet away. <BR><BR>I have seen nothing since, but today I heard strange \"knocking\" sounds, as if someone was knocking a hollow tree or something--i have no near neighbors where the sounds were coming from and it startled me enough to dash to the window.<BR><BR>Also, the same day (today) while out feeding the chickens, my son came running in saying he heard a horrible high pitched screaming type sound. I thought we might go off in the direction of the scream, but then thought I wasn''t brave enough to do that! <BR><BR>I am not a nutcase, I assure you! We are Christians and would not make up such a story. I can not tell you if any of these things have anything to do with each other or if they are even a Bigfoot at all, but what i have reported to you is true to the best of my knowledge. The only thing I''m shaky on is the date. I will never forget those eyes! <BR>",

    " My family resides close to Norman, Oklahoma, and from 1976 to the present, there have been numerous incidents revolving around Bigfoot, including two sightings in 1976 and one in January 2003, footprints in both mud and snow, several incidents where vocalization was heard, and numerous other accounts of stones being thrown, foul odor being smelled, fruit being taken off of trees, etc. Back in 1976, Bigfoot researcher Bob Stamps and his partner took several plaster casts of footprints and interviewed family members who had heard and seen the creature. The most recent sighting happened in January of this year. My 61-year old brother-in-law was chopping wood and breaking kindling approximately 40 feet from his house near the edge of the woods. It was early evening and he was just about to finish when he happened to look up and caught the sight of the creature out of the corner of his eye. At that point, the creature was approximately 15-18 feet away from him, standing in enough of a clearing so that he could see him from the waist up (due to thick underbrush he could not see any further down). He estimated the creature to be 7-8 feet tall with a slight hunch.  He froze for a minute and then dropped the wood that was in his hands and ran inside of the house. By the time he entered the house he was visibly shaken and according to my sister, he was \"as white as a ghost.\" The hair on his arms were standing on end caused by physical reaction of goosebumps due to the state he was in. He was having difficulty breathing and therefore was having a hard time speaking. All he could say was \"Buh...buh...buh...\" My sister and niece thought he was having a heart attack and were fearing for his life. When he was finally able to calm down, all he could get out was \"Bigfoot.  I just saw Bigfoot.\"  <BR><BR>Since my brother-in-law was snapping kindling over his knees, we have come to the conclusion that it was this noise that drew the creature to him.     ",

    "In July of 1983 I worked for the timber company driving a one ton truck pulling a 12 hundred gallon tanker in the Honobia, Pickens are of McCurtain county. On a trip back to our facility a very large hairy creature ran across the road in front of me. I came within a few feet of running over it. It did not stop it just kept on running. It was approximately seven feet tall and very poor. The upper torso of its body was a brownish color and the lower was a lighter color. One of the things I particulaily noticed was no SHOES. My first thought was someones pulling a prank. I soon realized that couldn''t be, not up here in these mountainous forest. No houses for miles.

Two others came out of the nearby forest and carried him away. That the FBI was called and samples of blood and hair have been taken for testing. My relative also told me that contractors who plant young pine seedlings are refuseing to go in near Honobia and plant trees. Today Jan 28, 2000 we have had a very heavy snow and while I was home listening to the scanner I overheard a conservation between two Oklahoma game wardens talking about the incident. One told the other to be on the lookout for large manlike hairy creatures. They seemed very serious. They were talking about the same incident that I have mentioned above. This area is called the Honobia Wildlife area and is very,very sparsly inhabited. The area of 875.000 acres is owned by a large timber company and as the loggers move in to cut there are sightings. <BR>",

    " I was returning from one of my research areas in the Pine Barrens with a friend of mine. We had spent a few hours out in the forest on this cold and damp night trying to illicit a response from a Sasquatch. We had zero activity, and due to the declining weather conditions, I decided to wrap it up for the night around 12:35am. We packed up our gear, and began the drive homeward.<BR><BR>We had just crossed a main road entering back into civilization, and were discussing music - when something came charging out from the front right side of the road. I was traveling at around 50mph, and got on my brakes hard. Luckily I had anti-lock brakes and avoided skidding, and I barely missed hitting the creature.<BR><BR>My friend was holding a bottle of water between her legs, and when I braked - she slid forward and the water sprayed all over her. She said \"What was that?!\" And I replied \"Deer\", and she said \"No it wasn''t!\"<BR><BR>I then realized that what I had just seen was not a deer, or a dog, bear, or human dressed in a costume. It had no muzzle, tail, or pointy ears, and the legs were thicker than mine. It ran hunched over, and appeared to propel itself faster by pumping its arms. Just as it looked like it was about to be hit, it turned its upper body, and looked at us with an expression of shock as if it knew it had messed up. It never broke stride, and continued running across the road and into the woods across the street.<BR><BR>I slowed my vehicle and made a U-turn returning to the spot.

I remember very clearly the part in the hair along the spine, due to the wet weather. <BR><BR>I passed within 15 feet of the animal as it climbed very quickly to the top of the road cut and out of sight. What always struck me as odd is that the animals spine did not flex like that of a bear when it was moving, and that its rear legs were not directly under it, more out to its sides as it climbed out of sight.  It also had very large, broad shoulders. The animal climbed hand-over-hand to the top of the roadcut in about 3 seconds.  <BR><BR>",

We loaded our gear in the back and headed back to base camp as the others left to go back into the woods to do some further research. Interested in getting back to base camp and getting warm, and much needed sleep, I was concentrating on watching for animals in the roadway, as I didn''t want us to hit something and be stuck out there in the cold. Mike was driving and there was no conversation until we topped a hill in the road, and I saw something moving in the same direction that we were in the middle of the road. I pointed and asked \"what is that?\". Mike slowed and asked \"what is what?\" and I answered \"that thing in the road just beyond the headlights.\" Mike looked and said \"holy s---!\" and I said \"whatever it is don''t hit it.\" What we saw was a large dark upright moving creature walk in the middle of the road. It was about 5 1/2 to 6 feet tall, moving upright, in the same direction that we were traveling. It had noticeable hair and its head seemed domed and no neck, as if its head rested right on its shoulders. It was very very broad at the shoulders and thick (massive). It never turned to look at us, so I don''t know what the face looked like. We have no recollection of its hands or lower body, our focus was on how wide it was and how smooth that it moved. It was amazing, just very graceful. No jerky movements, very fluid in its movement.<BR><BR>As we neared, it moved to the side of the road in a smooth motion then stepped off into the ditch and into the woods to the right side of the road. Then Mike realizing what we were witnessing, stopped the jeep and grabbed the gun and flashlight and jumped out to look for tracks. I stayed in the jeep not believing what I was seeing with it running. As mike scanned the woods following sounds he was hearing, he motioned for me to cut the engine and waved for me to get out an join him. I did both reluctantly. As I got near Mike he asked for me to look where he was shining his flashlight and to tell him what I saw, to my utter disbelief I saw a large shape of head and shoulders move quickly between two trees and disappear. I must have blinked because it was there one second and gone the next. We scanned the woods and the road for any signs but couldn''t see anything, we also listened for movement but it was dead quiet. We then moved back into the jeep and just sat there, amazed at what we had just witnessed. There was no odor and no sound, other that what Mike had heard before I got out of the jeep. In reflection on the event I did have the feeling that we were being watched. Mike was so excited over this he could hardly think, so I grabbed a pad and pen and said to him, \"Here let''s write down what we saw.\" He was so shaken that he couldn''t even write, so I took over and had him dictate what he saw and added what I saw. Not having any way to communicate with the others in the woods, we didn''t know what to do. Not thinking clearly because of the excitement and lack of sleep we drove back to base camp, where we were headed in the 1st place. Upon reaching camp, I just couldn''t face another cold night on the ground and begged Mike to take me into town to a nice warm hotel. The next day we returned and reported the incident to Daryl Colyer and the rest of the group.",

    " Dr. and Mrs. E. were riding in their private sleeping compartment in the train from Chicago to Portland, a near annual event to visit relatives in Portland. He was closely watching the clock, since the train had left with a delay and, consequently, needed to make numerous, unscheduled stops to let other trains pass. With admirable honesty they admitted to them both having been near naked. <BR><BR>During the afternoon, about 2 pm, the train made an unscheduled control stop about 10 minutes train travel West of the Dalles, OR. Looking diagonally into a snow-covered clearing in the woods between the train and the Columbia River, they saw a dark sasquatch stepping into the clearing, accompanied by several \"dark birds\" of an unidentified species. The sasquatch hunkered down to look at the train, and got up once or twice to walk a few steps and hunker down again. The hair on its legs stuck out on the surface of the snow \"like bellbottom pants\"; when hunkering, its arms were outside its knees and it rose without assistance from the arms or hands. The E.''s felt secure within the train and were not seen by the sasquatch [tinted windows]. They could exchange mutual questions over the 8-minute period that the train stopped, verifying their mutual impressions of its reality and configuration. <BR><BR>Contrasty lighting precluded detailed viewing of features of the animal. The conductor admitted obliquely to seeing it, too, but the geometry of the terrain precluded viewing by others in compartments ahead or behind that of the E.''s. They could not alert others during the event because of their dishabille. The train left with the sasquatch watching. They both stated their absolute conviction that what they saw was a sasquatch.<BR>",

    " On March 4, 2012 at approximately 8:30 AM I had a visual sighting. It was cold, snowy, a bit overcast and a bit windy and approximately 28 to 30outside.I was sitting in my mothers apartment on the fourth floor watching TV and I happened to look out the window and I counted 15 full-grown turkeys moving down the hill adjacent to her apartment building. They were not running but they were not taking their time either. I would like to say this moment is not unusual to see two or three turkeys at a time coming down the hill but 15 were out of the ordinary. A short time later three deer came walking down the hill in the same manner as the turkeys, not actually running but not walking either. I did not think anything unusual was going on but I was surprised at the number of turkeys at one time. I asked my mother who lived there for several years if she had seen that many at one time and she said no. My mother who is 80 years old, my wife who is 38 years old, my son who is 11 years old, and I (53 years old) watch the turkeys walk across the parking lot and out of sight down by the church. I did not summons my family to see the deer as three deer were no big deal. Less than five minutes after the turkey and deer left the area I was still sitting in my mothers room watching TV when I caught a glimpse of something out of corner of my eye and I looked and I saw a very large, very hairy animal that is unknown to me near the top of the hill. The animal was on all fours and near the top of a hill and took about three strides before it got to the top of the hill stood up and made a right and ran (on 2 feet) into the forest part of the field. It did not stand fully erect but like two thirds erect. The total time I had eyes on the creature was approximately seven seconds. Since that day I have tried to figure out in my mind what it could have been and I have no answer, honestly, the best I can say is that looked like a gorilla. Please understand that when I was younger I was a hunter. I did a lot of deer hunting and bear hunting in the Allegheny Mountains and seen a lot of animals but never seen anything like this.  I was a police officer for over 20 years and have been trained in observing my surroundings and articulating reports. South Park is not far from my mothers apartment building and is full of wildlife and trees. In my mind I feel as though the creature was responsible for chasing the turkey and deer out of the woods, may have been very hungry and chase them too far not realizing that it had made its way into a populated area and when I saw it, it was trying to get back to the forest.

We were waiting for the enemy to come up the hill so we could engage them, but then we heard a noise from behind so we turned around to see what what it was. We thought it was a bear about ten yards but it seemed like it was taking a knee so we stared at it for about a minute then it got up onto its feet and started walking to our position and we did nothing as it walked between our fighting holes which were about 15 feet apart. As it passed by us, it knew that we were there because it didn''t keep his eyes off of us, he  looked down at me directly as it passed by then he stopped about 15 feet away, and turned around, but not completely, he turned at his waist to a look back and disappeared.

    " In January of 1979, I was visiting some friends at their farm in Cambria County, just outside of Patton, Pennsylvania.  They had recently had one of their beef cattle butchered and I was helping wrap the meat. Their farm was at the top of a ridge, and could only be reached via a gravel and dirt lane winding through the woods approximately 1/2 mile.  <BR><BR>My mother had told me if I wanted a ride home I was to meet her at the bottom of their lane at 7pm, as she would be returning from town.  (unless you had a 4 wheel drive you could not make it up their lane with snow and ice). <BR><BR>I had dallied around and stayed too long to meet my mother, It was about 9:30pm and my friends father asked me if I wanted a ride to my uncles house (where we were staying). My friends were making fun at me for needing a ride home, so I turned it down. <BR><BR>I had walked home at night numerous times during both winter and summer. They gave me a nap sack to put a few steaks in for my help, and a large metal flashlight (which I would not really need as there was snow on the ground, and a full moon that night). <BR><BR>As I left their house I was aware of a very strange odor in the air (like stale armpits or dirty socks), but figured it was something from their coal furnace. I started down the lane when I felt a very real feeling that someone was watching me, and the hairs of my neck stood on end. <BR><BR>I looked up toward their farmhouse and approximately 80 to 100 yards away, standing on the raised edge of their pond was a huge, dark, hairy animal.  As I turned to look at it, it did not move. As soon as my eyes focussed on it I knew right away that it too was looking at me.<BR><BR>I know this sounds very strange, but even though it was far away, it was as if we were staring at each other from across a room. I did not react with thinking, as I was scared out of my mind. I did make a decision (why I do not know) to run down the lane and try to get some distance between myself and it.<BR><BR>As I ran down the lane I began hearing crashing sounds coming from an old logging road approximately 200 feet into the woods to my left. While I ran the noise kept pace with me, and when I fell on some ice I was sure it would overtake me.<BR><BR>By the time I got to the end of their lane I was not aware of any more noises and never lost pace as I ran the next 3/4 mile up the asphalt road to my uncles house. I beat on the door and when it opened I collapsed inside, and passed out. My Uncle and Aunt asked me what was wrong, and I was too afraid to tell them out of fear of being ridiculed. <BR><BR>Years later after watching an episode of \"In Search Of\" I saw the Patterson BigFoot film, and ABSOLUTELEY KNEW that was the same creature I saw that night years earlier.  I have to say that I know what I saw, and I did not see a man, black bear, or deer. <BR><BR>When I made eye contact with this thing, I knew it was a thinking, contemplating being, and not just a wild animal. I was raised in the country, and I have seen all of these animals both at night and day.<BR><BR>To this day I will not go into the woods near there after dark, whether I am in a vehicle or not! <BR><BR>Strange or not I can count on one hand (without using my thumb) the number of people I have told this story to.",

    " Hiking the Seven Sisters Trail from Mt Holyoke to the Notch in the Hadley / Amherst area of Massachusetts. My hiking partner and I got to Taylor''s Notch and could hear the wind ripping through making eerie noises. We both heard a lot of whistling  and breaking branches which I initially attributed to the wind going through the rocky ledges of Taylor''s Notch. We hiked over one large hill and the wind was lessening but we realized the whistling was closer and then there were whooping noises and calls along with the whistles. The calls were going back and forth and I realized we were surrounded. We kept talking loudly hoping to scare off any animals and kept my bear spray in hand for the next mile or so. Not sure what it was but highly unusual and did not sound like a grown or baby bear,canine, coyote, mountain lion, or fox. I frequently hike and spend time outdoors. I am at a loss as to what was with us that day. I am going back soon to see if I can find more.",

    " Hello!<BR><BR>This is something that happened a long time ago and to be honest I never thought it could be connected to Sasquatch/Bigfoot but recently Ive been reading about the topic a lot and I figured Id send it to you guys after finding your site and just checking out reports from areas where Ive lived in the past. Anyway, I found a report from Belchertown, MA and I lived a rural part of Belchertown for several years when I was in college. <BR><BR>This was sometime around 1997-1998 in Belchertown. My housemates and I were out on our porch which faced a 2-3 acre meadow. This open meadow and the porch were on the east side of the house. The entire area past the meadow to the East was wooded with houses and cabins here and there for about a mile until you hit a lake. Behind the house was abput 10-20 yards of woods with a walking trail and then another 10 yards past was a train tracks running East/west then more woods. <BR><BR>Anyway, my housemates and I were out on the porch when we heard the sound of a tree crashing to the ground.  About 19 seconds later while we all were kindve shocked there was an enormously loud and guttural growl/scream/roar.  In all my life I have never heard any animal sound that could match it in intensity, volume, and it just sounded plain angry and vivacious. It is hard to describe just how loud it was and how stunned we all were that this was coming from an animal just inside the tree line.  There were coyotes, owls, foxes galore back there and the sounds they made were a world away in comparison.  <BR><BR>We all immediately looked at each other, got up and went into the house as fast as we could without saying a word. <BR><BR>Everyone assumed it was an animal but after reading about and hearing recordings of presumed Sasquatch scream and howls it brought the memory rushing back because it is so similar to what we heard. <BR><BR>Anyway, just wanted to send this in as I saw there was another report for this area. <BR><BR>Best regards ",
    :environment
    "The property was about 7 acres. Most of it a meadow but wooded in front of the street with a small creek near the road. Woods surrounded the entire property and behind the house there was a public trail and a train track running parallel East/west behind the house. To the east of the 2-3 acre was a wooded area filled with many large Birch trees. The houses in this area are mostly in the woods.",

My Uncle, worked at the Pumping Station, he let me and my cousins fish there. I stayed there for weeks at a time. As an adult, I couldn''t help myself to go fishing there still. I respected the land and put all fish back and wouldn''t throw any trash around. I packed it up and brought it back with me. I fished there all day sometimes but mostly at night with top-water poppers for Small-Mouth bass. Fun,fun!",

    " I parked up the road a ways so any cops or ranger patrols didn''t see my car. It was 1am with a 3/4 moon. The water was very low this day. I was fishing and there was about 4 Beaver-Tail slaps on the water so I knew there would''nt be any smallies hanging around. I took a few more casts and caught a Dace. Its like a sucker with the body of a trout. Very silver in color and unedible. I was trying to get the fish off my hooks when I heard something heavy about 45 yrds away from me cracking sticks as it approached from the road onto the freshly cut brush (from the work they did around there, days prior).<BR><BR>It sounded like a human walking, and I thought I was in trouble with the law. My flashlight was dying and I was having trouble seeing just getting the fish off my 2 treble hooks. <BR><BR>I asked, \"Who''s There?!?!\" and I just heard a stick snap really loud as it stood still. I hit my flashlight in order to make it brighter and I seen big eyeshine and a dark sillouette of what looked to be shoulders. I started yelling at it to get out of here and at this point, I''m thinking deer... or worse, maybe a bear standing up. I heard a few more big snaps as it walked onto the paved road and that''s when it cried out in this terrible noise that I''ve never heard before. It echoed thru the mountains and it scared the bajesus out of me.<BR>It wasn''t a bear, or a deer, that''s for sure. It was huge, and the sound it made sounded like a shrieking demon baby. That''s the only way I could describe it. A loud shrieking howl. It wasn''t a roar or a deep growl. It was more high pitched.<BR><BR>I cut my line with the lure still in the fishes mouth and kicked the fish half hazardly into the water and ran as fast as I could to my car which was the scariest run/walk/stop & listen journey to my car I''ve ever encountered in my life.

I''ve worked as a wilderness counselor for the past 10 years and heard all sorts of animal noises in the night foxes, coyotes, owls etc.. This sound had a lack of clarity but power in its voice. I knew that it came from a long distance away. I remember listening to Bigfoot calls years back and on a hunch ran inside found the EXACT same howls on the net sounded like the Snohomish, WA 1978-79 calls. I woke up my friend who has been hunting western mass for 30 years and he said he never heard anything like it. He heard it and he said it gave him the chills. The howls trailed off as if he creature was moving. Incident lasted for about 10 minutes. I google mapped the area the sound came from and its a huge swath of wilderness that stretches into Vermont and south into Connecticut. ",

    " First of all, I feel the need to preface this report with some background information. I have been in the process of writing a book on Ape Cave near Mt St Helens. I contacted Jeff Lemley about getting some reports about Bigfoot stories to add to my book. I have kept in close contact with Jeff since the first contact and emailed him immediately after we got back from our trip.<BR><BR>I told my husband, Larry, that I wanted to go camping at Peterson Prairie for my birthday (August 15th) with my twin sister, Vicki and her husband, Jim K. I thought it would be fun to take in a cave or two, time permitting. My husband and I are avid cavers and enjoy spending free time exploring the wild caves of Southern Washington State near Mt St Helens and Mt Adams. We both felt it would be a good time to introduce my sister and her husband (and their toy red Poodle, Sparky) to the sport of wild caving.<BR><BR>The four of us drove our two minivans through the Dark Divide and arrived at camp late in the day on the 14th. Our favorite camp spot was still available so we proceeded to set up camp. As it turned out, my sister and her husband, took the safe way out and set up camp in their Dodge Caravan, while I pitched our miniscule backpacking tent 50 feet South of the camp in a small clearing surrounding by small pines. It was just enough room to pitch a small tent and still be able to tie off the guy ropes to keep the rainfly away from the tent.<BR><BR>As far as I knew, the night was uneventful until my husband spoke up the next morning. Larry told all of us that he thought he heard a Bigfoot howling (my husband is an extreme skeptic when it comes to anything related to Bigfoot). We all talked about it for a while and then decided to get ready to go caving in Cheese Cave, a local lava tube. Later in the day, we rode our bikes to some local caves and then went back to camp. Later, Larry and I left my sister and her husband at camp to rest while we set out to find Dynamite Cave. We drove around all of the dirt roads in the STR that we thought it was supposed to be located in. We parked the van at several locations. At one spot, my husband started walking down a remote trail with me following a short distance behind him. I stopped on the trail not far from the car because I heard something very large run through the bush to my right, just off the trail. My husband kept going, but I was too apprehensive to move. Whatever it was, it was huge; but it didn''t sound like an elk moving through the bush. Also, I felt like something was watching me. It was quite creepy! Since Larry had moved out of sight, I felt very vunerable and literally ran up to catch up with him. I kept telling him I wanted to go back to the car; but didn''t want to go by the one spot alone. He finally relented and we walking briskly to the car.<BR><BR>That night we all walked to the clearing due East of camp, next to the road which led to the group camp to watch the stars and anything else interesting in the clear skies. After turning in about 10PM, we slept soundly until about 3AM, when I was awakened by an incredibly loud howling, unlike anything I had ever heard in my life. Since I am an avid outdoorsperson, I have camped out and seen and heard most of the wild things that occur in the forests and mountains. This was like nothing I had ever heard before. There was absolutely no other sounds from the forest until a Barred Owl responded to the howl. <BR><BR>I woke Larry up to ask him about the howls. He said that it was the very same thing that he heard the night before. We both listened to it banter back and forth with the owl. After maybe 10 to 15 minutes of howling, the owl took off flying North through the trees. We could both hear his wings flapping as he was hooting. He was much closer to us than the thing which was howling; but the howling was much louder than the owl. <BR><BR>What happened next sent chills down my spine. I was laying on my stomach in the tent, needing very much to go outside and relieve myself; but unwilling to venture outside due to the howlings I was still listening to. Larry had fallen back asleep, so unfortunately, the thing I heard next fell on my ears alone. The best I could describe it was a howling turning into an Ape-like chattering. It sounded like someone was practicing phonics by contorting their mouth, while at the same time, reciting all the vowels. That is the best I can describe it. The sounds were incredibly loud and quite frightening sounding. I lay motionless until the sounds died down and I fell asleep.<BR><BR>I was awakened one more time around 6:15 to 6:30 in the morning. Light was already finding its way into camp which I could see through the mosquito netting at the head of our tent. This time I heard a pack of coyotes start up, followed again by that same howling sound. At this point, I was really getting freaked out; but was still not willing to venture out of the tent. As soon as it was light enough, I got up and ran to my sister''s van. I rapped on their window and asked if they heard the howls. Of course, they hadn''t heard anything; but were quite interested in what Larry and I had heard that night.<BR><BR>When I got home, I emailed Jeff Lemley to see if he had any wave files to listen to that might sound like what we heard. I listened to every owl sound on the web and nothing sounded like what we heard. A few days later, I got an email from Jeff about the other report four days before ours, only 6 miles North of us. As I told Jeff, both my husband and I would like to think that the sounds we heard were in fact, Barred Owls. Anyone sleeping in a flimsy nylon tent would probably convince themselves of the same. But then again...",

    " I am reporting this incident from 1991 because I heard of your group on the radio on the way home from work tonight, and you sound credible.<BR><BR>I served as a US Army Infantry Sergeant at Ft.Lewis Wa. for several years, I am also an alpine climber. I went to Mt Adams most of the time because it was much more private than other mountains ie: St Helens, Rainer -- to many people. I also loved the thousands of acres of wilderness area which was restricted to six or eight hearts per group and no vehicles.<BR><BR>Another Sergeant named Jim Avila, my climbing partner, and good friend, and his Golden Retriever pup were there also.<BR><BR>We were only camping and hiking around this trip, since we had the puppy with us, normally we would have camped on a snowfield above the tree line.<BR><BR>Just after nightfall we were talking and the puppy was next to the fire. The sky was crystal clear and everything \"felt\" normal. Since I spent six months out of the year living in the woods, and deserts of the western US and Europe, in the Army, the night is my ally--- I am an expert at what normal feels like.<BR><BR>I needed to urinate, so I stood up and walked to my right rear about 20 feet where a path led down to a stream, I could hear and see the slow moving shallow water in this shallow pea gravel bedded creek, I did my thing and returned to the fire.<BR><BR>We then decided to have some fun and see if we could get a coyote to howl, although we were not sure if any may have been around. We started our best howls to no avail. We continued for about five min. and then stopped. About and hour passed since my previous trip to urinate and I figured I would go again before getting in the sleeping bag.<BR><BR>Jim was across from the fire and could see my walking toward the spot overlooking the path to the creek where I intended to void my bladder, HA HA. <BR><BR>As my feet stopped I could hear footsteps in the dry gravel on the other side of the creek bed about 20'' away. When It heard me stop, it stopped a little to late and I heard it. I felt intelligence in it''s movement, not instinct, it knew it had been busted and just froze. I froze and drew my pistol Jim saw this and at the same time said the puppy flew into the cab of the truck. <BR><BR>Jim, also sensing something wrong, drew his pistol, and stood up. I was looking right where this guy was standing but could not see him because he was across the water but still in front of the opposite bank, he was still frozen like a ROCK. Jim came to back me up he did not know what in the hell was going on and instead of telling him to stop I just kept my eyes glued to the spot I knew the guy was at and he finally decided to move out.He took two strides up the bank away from me with a look over his right shoulder as he was moving away to the right.<BR><BR>His look was concern mixed with a child like fear, as if he really wanted to introduce himself in some way to our \"wolf-calling group\", Also puzzled like \"why are you indiots calling coyotes?----Your Humans, Stupid!\". The most animal like trait was a sort of a very brief mock anger face, which looked like an after-thought just before the big guy went into the woods. <BR><BR>I looked at Jim --- no words --- we threw most of our stuff in the truck and left in a big hurry. There was no way I was staying in those woods that night.<BR><BR>The big guy was huge, but slender as I recall. Don''t ask me how, but I know he was an adolesent. He was sort of like a big kid, but moved like the wind. He saw my eyes and I saw his. I did not tell Jim what I saw, I never did. I never had to.<BR><BR>Please belive me, I swear this account to be true.<BR>Thank You, and God''s Speed in your search.<BR>",

    " My wife and I started to make our descent from the summit of Mount Greylock during a morning hike.  Approximately half a mile on the Cheshire Harbor Trail, close to Rockwell Rd, my wife and I heard a clapping sound.  We stood in place for a few moments, listening to the sound.  The \"clapping\" was non-rhythmic, sometimes there was one or two, other times there were many \"claps\".  In between the \"claps\" there was sounds of something walking, breaking fallen branches as it moved.  The sounds were about a distance of 100 feet from our position on the trail, within a thicker patch of woods.  We listened for almost a full minute and then decided to continue on the trail, moving closer to the source of the sound.  When we reached the area where we believed the clapping sound to be coming from we listened again and heard nothing and had seen no movement.  Further down the trail I attempted figure out the sound.  I did some tree knocking and banged rocks together, but only when I clapped my hands did it most closely match the sound my wife and I had heard.  It was a sound that I have never heard before and it has sparked my interest into figuring out what animal made this noise.",

    " Approx. summer of 2000, I was on Negus Mountain in Rowe, MA (Franklin County) with my wife, sitting on the tailgate...we heard something in the woods, about 100 yards away, walking towards us.  As it got closer, it started to walk faster.  As a life long hunter, I at first told her not to worry, it''s a squirrel or something.  As this creature got closer, my ears and experience told me that this was a biped, only 2 feet crunching through the leaves.  My wife was so freaked out that we had to leave immediately before I could investigate more.<BR><BR>Fast Forward to 2006, I was driving to work one night for the 2300 job in East Deerfield, MA.  I remember I was running a little late, so I was probably speeding, and the time would have been 2230ish.  It was raining lightly.  In West Charlemont, at the end of so-called Tea Street Extension, there is a bridge that carries the road over the railroad tracks. This is about 2-3 miles (the way the bird flies) from the encounter above.  What I saw was something standing perfectly still behind the guardrail.  It was about 6, maybe 6 and a half feet tall, had long brown hair all over it''s body, and was stock still.  I drive this route almost daily (or nightly, in my case) for over 12 years, I know what belongs and what doesn''t.  This did not belong.  I turned around and went back, and it was gone.  Being late for work, I turned around again and went to work.  I have never had any doubt that I saw a Sasquatch.  I haven''t reported it because I don''t want people to think I am a crackpot.

    " A friend and I had been on Black creek in Clay county for a few hours bass fishing with absolutely no luck.  Working the last stretch of bank before we called it a day when I heard something walking in the woods.  I could hear large footsteps and something that sounded like it was scooping water or slapping water, I really can''t describe the sound.  <BR><BR>Now I know this particular area and the wildlife that inhabits it pretty well I think, It is full of deer, wild boar, turkeys, a few black bears, and the rest of the small woodland critters.  And this sound was way too large to be any of them.  <BR><BR>Back to my story, after we heard the noise I motioned to my friend to be silent so I could trolling motor over to the bank so I could try to get a look.  As we were silently getting closer it seemed like the creature must have noticed us because we stuck out like a sore thumb against the back drop of the creek, while it stayed perfectly camoflauged in the wood.  We sat there for a few moments hoping it would move and reveal itself to us which it never did.  <BR><BR>So, as the sun was dropping we had to get back to the boat ramp, we quitely circled away from the shore.  Just as we got away from the tree line something landed in the water about 50 or so feet from the boat. It was a loud splash like a rock or heavy object was thrown because it hit about 15 feet from shore.  Both startled we put out life jackets on and got ready to leave when we heard the footstep start back up, and they sounded as if they were running away at a brisk pace and it sounded like it was a long stride. <BR><BR>Jokingly we said we had just encountered a sasquatch just like every other time I heard something unusual on that body of water.  But as we made our way back to the dock I noticed we were within half a mile from powerlines.  And were within a mile of the county dump that I know for a fact is a popular spot with the local whitetail deer population.  ",

    " I''d like to make a report, however it was years ago but I remember every part pretty well.<BR><BR>I told a few folks about this over the years and they think I was nuts. But doesn''t matter what they think. I was close enough to know what it was. I would say about less than 50 ft. Right in the middle of a fire road.<BR><BR>In December 1977, my dad, uncle and my dad''s other friends and myself went up to the cabin owned by a hunters club in Gardner, Mass. We went to spend the night, cook food and my dad and his friends like to play cards after eating supper. Myself and a friend used the snowmobile with a sled attached to the back, we took turns driving the ski doo around and the other would stand on the foot rest on the sled.<BR><BR>The area was in northern central Massachusetts, very close to New Hampshire boarder. The cabin is in Ashburnham Mass. It''s about 2.5 miles up a fire road called Old Colony Road. I remember it was a snowy winter that year. The area where we saw this thing was right on the edge of a swamp, old train tracks run right thru the area and crosses the fire road that we used to get to the cabin.<BR><BR>It was about 4 p.m. or so, it was just getting a little dark. My friend and I left the cabin with the snowmobile, he was driving first and I was on the foot rest on the sled. We left and came up to the swamp, crossed over the tracks and headed down the road about 50 ft or so. It was getting a little late and we decided to not go to far so we turned the sled around on the road. Had to pick it up because of the narrowness of the road. Once we turned it around it was my turn to drive. So now were facing the tracks and the swamp is on both sides of the road. the road goes right thru the swamp and the tracks cross right by the edge of the swamp.<BR><BR>At this point I looked behind me to see if my friend was on the sled and holding on, when I looked up I saw this creature walking on 2 legs like a human. He crossed right by the tracks at the edge of the swamp and crossed the road right in front of us. I remember it looking at us and I remember the arms swing clearly. Just like the pictures I have seen from your site. Very similar. Anyway, I remember the its size, that''s what was scarey, so large, I''d say about 7to 9 ft high, weight about 400 to 500 pounds. At least for something that size it would most likely be heavy. I know the woods there well. I''ve spent years in the military and hunt every year. I have been trained in tracking and survival in the woods so I know what I am saying and what I saw. But the thing took about 2 steps and he was across the road. All black hair, didn''t notice any smells, but I can tell you this. I won''t forget that day ever. It was cold anyway and with no breeze the smell of it wouldn''t travel far. My friend was shocked. He won''t even mention it when I see him these days. He told one person and they treated him like he was on drugs. So thats why I never wanted to tell to many people.<BR><BR>I wanted to say something about it now because I just say a program on TV the other night about bigfoot and the Kiamichi Mountians, I think in Oklahoma or somewhere out there.<BR><BR>I remember one other thing that might be relevant. That being noises I have been hearing over the years in the woods there. Something like a crying sound but so load it almost seemed as if it were close by. I think it was a ways away because when we heard the sounds it was late, about midnight. We sit by the fireplace outside the cabin sometimes late cooking steak or deer meat on the grill. Behind the cabin is a huge swamp area that goes up to Route 12 in Ashburnham, Mass. The swamp is down a bit behind the cabin. We find moose droppings back there and lots of tree scraps from deer.<BR><BR>I beleive there passing thru that area at times. Those sounds I heard were never heard there before and I don''t hear them now when I go up there. Every now and then they seem to come back, but only when were outside sitting by the fire. Strange indeed. These woods go far as well and you could easily travel them and end up in New Hampshire or further without seeing a house.<BR><BR>As time goes by and the more I read about what other folks saw and the similarities between each story I''m more wanting to do some of my own investigating, but its very scary out there at night, especially for me. I carry a loaded .44 when I''m up there just because I have seen this thing up close enough to know what it was. No doubt in my mind. ",

    " I am 45 years old, have spent my whole life in the woods. I have been hunting and fishing since I was very young. On June 28th my wife and I decieded to take a walk in the woods. We were heading to a secluded resivior located aprox. 2 miles in the woods. We came upon a spot in the woods that seemed liked someone was watching us. We heard a noise come from some bushes. I thought it was a grunt from a buck. We both expected to a deer come outof the brush. I said, maybe it was a Bigfoot. She told me to shut up and keep walking. We walked for another 15 minutes and realized we were on the wrong path to the lake. We stopped, ate lunch and headed back into the woods. We had stopped at some power lines and sat in some shade. It was over 94 gegrees that day, and this was about noon time.<BR>As we walked back, we both noticed some very DEEP foot prints that did not look right. They were clearly 5 toed \"Human\" prints. In between the prints, was some deer tracks. The tracks clearly looked like the Human prints were chasing the deer prints. We both looked at each other and said, why would someone be running Barefoot, in 100 degree weather in the middle of the woods on a Tuesady afternoon? There were no other people in the woods at that time. The tracks were not there the first time we passed this spot, the noise was, the tracks were not. At this point I became very concerned that what ever made the prints was still in the area. I grabbed a big rock and told my wife to take some pictures with her cell phone. The tracks were about 6 to 7 feet apart. I could tell the first print was a right foot, that jumped out of the woods. The sixth and final step was a left foot that looked like it pushed off into the woods. No other tracks were before or after these six prints. We both became very nervous and started talking loudly and whistling. I did not want to run into this \"person\". We became a little confused and ended up on the worng path home. We walked for a couple hours, no way were we going back the way we came.<BR><BR><BR>Did not notice any smells or sounds. Just very quiet. No animal sound at all.",

We were on our way home and drove across the second bridge when a dark shape on the south side of the road caught my attention, and apparently my wife and mother also. I had not said anything until they said they saw something, my suspicions were now confirmed. I stopped the car and backed up. Whatever it was appeared to have been laying in the ditch that goes under the bridge and when I backed the car up it appeared to get up and lean over as if shielding itself and seemed as if it realized we could see it. The creature stood up and rushed at our car. It seemed that it covered about 30 feet effortlessly, it was very fast I think we were all shocked. I floored the car without thinking. I asked them if it was still behind us. They said it had come out into the road behind us. I got the feeling that it had wanted to scare us off. I questioned my wife and mother about what they had seen. We all saw the same thing. I just seen the immense size of it and it looked like it had very coarse looking hair.

The traffic was average not too many cars but a few, and I was doing about 65-68 mph.  I looked about 3/4 of a mile ahead and saw something off to the rightside of the highway not on the highway but near the woodline on the grass. At first it looked like someone possibly in a gilley suit but then as I got closer I couldn''t believe my eyes because it looked just like what you hear about and see artist renderings of a bigfoot like creature. It was too tall to be a person in a suit approx. 7-8ft tall and very broad with black hair. I couldn''t see any specific facial features or chest features as it turned into the woods when i was about 1/8 of a mile away. It was walking parralell to the woodline then took a 90 degree turn into the woods. When I saw this I immediately slowed down to about 50mph and looked intently into the woodline by this time I was able to get my sisters attention (she was listening to music on the I-Pod looking down) we both stared into the woods and Icouldn''t see anything but see thinks she saw something black moving in the woods. I still can''t believe what I saw, there was no cars parked on the left or right shoulders of the highway. The creature did not appear to be running the entire sighting lasted for 7-8 seconds.

    " On this day, myself, a friend, Eddy and 2 girls, felt like taking a ride. Before I begin I just want it noted that there was NO drinking or the use of drugs. We decided to go to Plum Island. At the time, the refuge was free to enter and the entire road was dirt. That day there was no one in the refuge, as we drove down the road,  I noticed no cars the entire 6.3 miles of the refuge, it was empty, we drove to the end.  At the last small area to park, I pulled in, across the road was a narrow boardwalk that lead to a 50 foot observation tower. We all went up. We hung around up there for about a half hour, I started hearing noises, first I heard clicking, loud clicking, then short high pitched screams, it sounded maybe 100 yards away. I took a look around, but didnt see anything.  I noticed there was no one in the area.  I saw no birds or waterfowl.  The sounds went on for about 10 minutes or so, I felt uneasy at this point and said we should go. We all got in my car and started back out. I was only driving for a couple of minutes and I saw a very large dark figure cross the road from the marsh/brush area on the left to the right, which had heavy brush and that lead to the beach.  I immediately looked at Eddy and asked did you see that?  He answered Yes! We asked each other what it was. The girls in the back seat didnt see anything s they were to busy talking to each other. I slowed to almost a stop where what we saw it cross the road, there was solid brush that it went into, we could see where something went through the brush. There was no sign of  it, it was gone. The figure that crossed was huge, 7 feet or more, very wide, all black from head to toe. It was a little hunched forward as it walked upright. I noticed its arms were longer than average and they swung as it walked.  It took only three steps to cross the road. The road is about three cars wide. It had a smooth stride. It did not look in my direction,  just crossed the road and it was gone. I only saw it for about 5 seconds I could never forget the image of it crossing the road. <BR>I went back there today, my children wanted to see where I had the sighting.  I didnt make back up the observation tower because of these flies that nest in the marsh, they are Green Headed Flies, they are, as the woman in the office said, man eaters.  They bite hard. As you drive down the road, they follow the car, dozens fly around the car. So the kids didnt want to get out and get eaten by them and neither did I, so I didnt get up on the observation tower to take a look. I have told a few people what I saw and they think Im nuts.  My father looks at me strange because he knows I dont make up stories like this, I dont lie, so he just looks at me when I talk about it to him. I know what I saw, and I saw what I saw.",

    " Hi, my name is xxxxxx, I grew up in Rowley, MA.. a small old farming town established in 1639.. when I was 10, I''m now 27, my friend an I were attempting to find a way through the woods from his home street to a plaza containing a dunkin donuts for the fun of it. like I said, I grew up in the woods and this is only a distance of about a half of a mile. We started out heading in the direction we thought was good and after a while we heard a noise in the distance.. at this point we were pretty deep into just new England forest when we heard something. in the distance.. (far enough to be a hard definite sighting but close enough to be odd as hell to this day) so we looked obviously and in the middle of the woods.. randomly.. were three.. THREE, tanned brown.. (not brown black, or brown brown, but brown tan) upright creatures, running through the woods together. AS IF THEY WERE TRAVELING!!!! they were close and tight and jogging along on the hill we were on about 400 yards away.. we just watched speechless and then decided it was time to give up on finding our way and head back. I don''t know if he told anyone ever, but we lost touch over the years, but that sighting will forever connect us.. I just thought anyone who follows bigfoot should know about this.. these 3 creatures were tanned and brown, upright, jogging in a line, and fully unclothed.. I''ve seen one other unexplained sighting, but this one was absolutely dumbfounded.. I don''t know if anyone has ever seen multiple bigfoots traveling together but I have. ",

    " My dog was bothering me to go out ealry morning around 3 AM on November 25th 2000. It was very brisk out and I believe the weather was clear. Not sure about the lighting. As I was walking her, I could hear coyotes howling for a good few minutes from a distance and didn''t think much of it. Then a few minutes later after it had stopped, I was about to walk inside and heard this loud wailing coming from the woods. It literally sent a chill down my spine. It definitely was not human and not anything else I would recognize. We don''t have much wildlife bigger than deer and coyote. This went on till about 5:30 AM and kept me up. The wailing to me almost sounded depressing like it was upset or something. I told my friend''s father a few weeks later and he told me that he was out walking his dog a few years earlier and said that he clearly saw something in the woods watching him. He never told anyone because he thought no one would be lieve him. This happened across the major road by the resevoir early evening. ",

    "    It was a mild day and I decided to take a walk in the woods. After traveling about 5 or 10 minutes down a woods road I heard 3 deliberate and distinct knocks which emanated about 50 yards away from inside the brush off to my left, it stopped me dead in my tracks. I have read many of the incidents on BFRO and I could not believe what I was hearing. I composed my self and found what I considered a sturdy stick and struck a large pine tree close by in the same manner as I had just heard. It took about 5 seconds and a reply came back but only 2 deliberate knocks this time. A couple of seconds later  another sound came from a direction parallel  to the first but about 50 yards apart. This sound was like a tree being struck but with the stick breaking on impact. When the stick broke it sounded like it had a girth of a couple of inches. I struck my tree 3 more times but nothing more happened. Let me add that as I was strolling down this trail I was smoking a cigar and the wind was blowing into the direction that the knocks came from.  I continued down the trail which takes you to the edge of a pond. While exploring there I found an interesting thing. Lying on the ground was what looked like a 3 foot wooden club with a jagged end where the roots would be, it looked like something that you would see in a cave man picture. There were also 2 holes in the ground one next to a tree, the hole about 12 inches in diameter and close to 20 inches deep the other about 5 feet away from the tree 3 or 4 inches in diameter and only 4 or 5 inches deep with the club laying on its side and the small end partially in that hole. I believe that this club dug both holes because of the way the end was all rounded and imbedded with dirt. But I do not understand why.<BR>      I decided to go back the next day for photographs and I brought a yard stick with me to get these measurements. When returning  the next day I discovered a good size pile of feces on the trail about 15 feet away from the tree I had knocked on. Nothing unusual took place this day but I did take a few pictures of various other things as well which may or may not be relevant. What or who  made those knocks I will probably never know but be clear on this they were distinct, clear, timed and deliberate, of this I am sure.          <BR>",

    "I do recall now after reading some accounts - about a \"path\" deep in the woods about a mile long that ran parallel to the houses. It was about 500 feet back of my house along an old stone wall. It was covered ( canopy of trees) and very dark-even on bright days. I would occasionally walk through the woods and found this path. The entrance was through the woods 1/4 mile down the street and through a dense pine grove - you would then enter an open field and then enter this dark section of woods. I found an irregular path that rambled - but always wondered why there were many broken branches and samll trees and closed in areas(like small trees pulled together) and the rocks in the wall would be all over the place - some of them were good size. I always thought that maybe some kids used this path to school or built forts or something but I now realize it was too dense and not really in the right direction to the schools. I never heard any kids out back in all the years I have been here (almost 30 years)",

    " Twenty Five years ago (1979) I heard the most awful and terrifying screams for 3 nights in a row. We had just built a two story addition which is situated further back on a lot (about 150 feet) into the woods from the street. This area was considered suburban but was fairly rural at that time. There are houses built along the street that are on lots of 3/4 to 1 acre. We own several acres of heavily wooded land and our house sits back on the lot further than the others. The section of woods is borderd by 3 state highways and was about 1 mile (length) by 1 1/2 miles (width)of woods and some farmland fields. At the time there were only two dead end streets that penetrated this section of woods. Another country road separates this section on the west with a State park nearby (1/2 mile from the road). This park is several hundred acres of lakes and heavily wooded areas. The area now is filled with housing and development.<BR><BR>It was July and was very hot (90 degrees +) and the peepers were very loud. Each evening between 2:00 and 3:30 a.m. an extremely loud howling, screaming sound would start far away. As it came closer ( the screams lasted for 20-30 seconds each and occurred every 1-2 minutes or so) you could hear bushes and branches being swept out of the way with loud crunching and breaking sounds and screams that would get louder in intensity. The woods at that time were covered with thick vines and brambles that were about 3-5 feet high. It was extremely difficult to walk through any section of the woods that was not cleared. You just didn''t stroll through the woods, especially in the pitch black. When this \"thing\" came closer all the peepers and the night sounds completely ceased. The sound was so loud in volume that it actually caused you to \"freeze\" - I mean that it ran your blood cold!  I remember laying in bed not wanting to investigate because whatever it was - it was BIG and I did not want to find out what it was! It was not the sound of a bear, a mountain lion or a wounded deer.The sound had a human quality about it and was like - it was searching for something and had a sense of pain or distress abut it. It would travel parallel through the woods about 100 feet behind my house. On the third night I got up immediately and waited for this thing to get closer. I have a switch in the bedroom that would turn on some roof mounted flood lights that would shine in the back yard. We did not have a deck or anything at the time and the woods were about 25 feet behind the house. This thing was crashing through the woods and when it was right behind the house it gave out this huge loud moan. I was looking out the window with all the inside lights out and then I turned on the floodlights. The scream stopped and there was silence for about 5 seconds and then it crashed through the woods away from the house very quickly opposite the direction it came from. You could hear the crashing of a two footed creature. I heard the crashing sounds for about another minute and then it faded and was quiet. I was really spooked and went downstairs and started turning on all the lights and the outside lights. I noticed that all my neighbors were turning on their outside lights as well. This was unusual because no one left outside lights on and there were no street lights in this section of the street.There were at least 4 other houses that turned their lights on. I contemplated whether to call the police but did not. The next day while mowing the lawn, my elderly neighbor across the street from me came over and said \"Dave, did you hear those sounds last night? I have heard them for several nights and almost called the cops - if I hear it again I am calling the police - I never heard anything like that in my life.\" I agreed and it was good that someone else confirmed the incident to me. All these years I have only told close friends of this story and the kidding I take is unmerciful- but I know to this day what I heard was absolutely real. I forgot about it for many years until I saw some \"bigfoot\" documentary in the early 1990''s. They played a recording and when I heard it- it brought back the whole incident. It was almost identical to the sound! I have played the sound recordings on various websights and would say that it was pretty close to the Ohio or Pennsylvania recordings. I never heard anything after 1979 and I did not see anything. Perhaps others have given reports from this area and this report may be helpful. I am being truthful about this - I do not drink or do any nonprescription drugs - I am a church administrator in a Bible (nondenominational) church.  ",

    " I''ve told very few people this story for fear that they might think I''m crazy. The only reason why I''m taking the time to report this is because of a recent entry a friend of mine who knew my story told me about.<BR><BR>My story takes place in Charlestown, Rhode Island in the late 1970''s. My mother and father and I lived in a wooded area abutting the \"Indian Cedar Swamp\" and property owned by United Nuclear which probably comprises several thousand acres. The property surrounding our home was mixed  white Atlantic juniper swamp,scarlet, red and white oaks with old growth white pine stands mixed in, with a dense understory of briars, mountain laurel and blue berry brush.<BR><BR>We lived off a road with 3 houses on it. The houses were all built close to the entrance of this development. The road was part of a series of roads that were put in as the start of a development. The roads were oiled gravel and had been left to grow in after years of little or no use. It looked like the developer had started and went belly-up.<BR><BR>These roads were great to ride bikes on or take a evening cruise on after bringing my father dinner at his second job. My mother drove a baby blue Mustang Mach 1 and she would drive around the roads with me looking at deer before we retired to our home for the evening. As a kid I remember this being a highlight to the evening.<BR><BR>I was at the time maybe 8 years old and my mother and I on this particular night in the late 70''s commenced our ride around the roads to see if we sould see any deer. It had been raining earlier with thunder and lightning mixed in. Now it was just raining. We were rounding a corner on one of the roads that paralleled the Indian Cedar Swamp and as we started downward,  we noticed the road was obstructed by a large blown down oak tree, the tree had green leaves (this makes me think it was summer or the early fall) on it so it had recently come down, we guessed maybe in the storm earlier(possibly lightning).<BR><BR>The road was very narrow and the brush along the side of the road made it difficult to back the car around to turn around. The rain was falling but not heavy, the wipers were on, the headlights on the car were on as well.<BR><BR>As my mother turned the front end  of the car the lights cast on the left side of the road where the tree had been broken off from its stump. We were maybe 1 1/2 car lengths from the stump. Beside the tall fractured stump stood what looked like a large white(yellow white) ape. It was maybe 6 to 7 feet tall, its hair was long, face flat, long massive arms, its head appeared to be without any neck, its chest was broad.<BR><BR>My mother and I froze momentarily (5 seconds, maybe 10) and the figure remained still, staring at us. My mother floored the car into reverse. I remember ther terror of it all. The sound of gravel hitting inside the fender wells, the sound of the brush crushing against the car and then the acceleration as she sped off.<BR><BR>We were clear as to what we saw and we have no question in our mind that we saw something or someone in ape like shape that night. This we are certain of. We need no one to tall us what we saw, it''s crystal clear.<BR><BR>For years we told no one. We would talk about it in our home in privacy and even my father found this story hard to accept. We''ve never forgotten this and this story would have never been told if it wasn''t for someone else informing me of a similar sigthing.<BR><BR>I''m now in my 30''s an extremely active hunter, farmer and woodsman. I hunt deer 40 days a year in Maine, RI, CT and New Jersey. I use automated cameras which are triggered by heat. I''ve never seen a picture of a bigfoot on my film. I have seen pictures of deer on my 50 acre tract of land that I would never believe are there if I didn''t see it on my film. I know every inch of my land and the surrounding property and these mystery deer show up at all hours on my cameras and frequently at that. How can they move right around our hunting parties in such a small area and never be seen, I''ll never know,<BR><BR>Even today I find it hard to accept what we definitely saw. I''m not a fan of ghosts, UFO''s or even big foot. I''m not sure to this day what I saw wasn''t a man in a costume, dressed up, out in rainstorm, a half mile or more from any home, waiting for my mother and me to drive down the road to give us a scare. The only thing I can say is it was a damn'' good costume and a damn'' good plan. We saw what we saw and this is something I would sware to on any polygraph test as I''m sure my mother would.<BR><BR>",

    " The exact date was October 15, 1998. I was training for a mountain bike race and this was to be my last ride prior to the race. I was riding at the Black Hut Management Area in Glendale,RI. Along for the ride was my three year old mixed breed (shepard/lab)large dog.<BR>It was sunny but cool and I planned to spend an hour or so breaking a swet. <BR>As i weaved my way through the trails, i had to leash my dog to cross a street. After I unhooked him we started up a hill toward a chasam. It''s small and kids hang around there and drink beer, have fires etc. At the crest of the hill I could see the top of the chasam (approx. 50 yards away). Out of the corner of my eye I noticed something that first appeared to be a dirty white blanket perhaps hung on a small tree. Suddenly (I think it heard us)it turned (as it was squatting with it''s back to me)saw me stood up and disapeared into the woods. I was shocked and could not believe what I had just saw. From my vantage point I would say the animal was white or grey but very dirty. In no way did it resemble a man. I did not see the face clearly. But from what I did see (full rear view) although it stood fairly erect, it''s gate and posture was like an ape. The arms were not long like a gorilla and oddly it was no were near seven-feet tall. I''d estimate maybe six feet at best.<BR>I reversed my direction and rode immediately to the top of the chasam. I looked for footprints and hair but didn''t find any. I walked a short distance in the woods in the direction were it disapeared. My heart was pounding so loud I could hear it. I knew it was no were in the general area because my dog was not barking. Anytime there is an animal near fox, coyote, deer, my dog barks and will usally chase. Interesting point is that my dog never barked and I don''t think he saw, heard or smelled it. I noticed no unusual smell in the area. And also noted no signs of broken branches and no way to determine its direction. <BR>I''ve told one or two people and in November of 1998 a friend and I (with video and digital camera) spent two weekends hiking in the area directly behind the chasam with no results. I also snow shoed the area after the first snow. I was starting to believe I had imagined it. In 2002 I met a hunter in a bar and asked him if he ever hunted at Black Hut. He said \"yes\", \"and once I saw a white gorilla there! I had chills and related my story. The differences were in color, he stated white (the one i saw was more grey) and said the one he saw was eight feet tall. Still, same place same type of sighting.<BR>What made me write this is the two other RI sightings seem to be similar. I wish I could have seen it longer and closer.         <BR>     ",

    "   While attending U.R.I in the Fall of 1974,I would stay at my girlfriends mother''s house on weekends because I only had a five day mealbook plan.<BR>  It was Sunday evening about 10:00pm when I decided to head back to school on my ten speed bike. Very dark in the area because it being mostly wooded, country like setting but yet city. I was going down her street and noticed my front center pull brake needed to be adjusted. I stopped under a street light at the end of her street which is an intersection to adjust the brake. Directly in front of me was a small field that sloped down and away from me,pitch black background, tall grass and a few bushes being light by the street light. Typical New England, Oak, Maple and, Pine trees.<BR>  As I was fixing my brake I began hearing very loud foot steps of a biped, comig from the field on the slope side,more like a crushing thud. I could hear the actual compression being placed, like someone dropping a heavy metal ball/rock on the ground.I looked up to see if I could see anything and just said to myself \"its nothing\", and went back to fixing my brake. I noticed it was getting closer and felt very apprehensive, the sound was coming in my direction. All of sudden this dog starts barking like crazy, I can hear the chain snap as it either tries to attack or getaway from something.<BR>  I said to myself \"its time to go!\", as I started I turned left to head north, into a few pedals.<BR>From out of the darkness steps into the street light this white looking gorilla. The legs present themselves then the body as it comes to rest on its knuckles. Twenty maybe twenty five feet away, directly across the street from me perhads six feet tall maybe 400 pounds or more. Massive arms that went straight down on its knuckles, knees slight bent.The head is higher in the back connected to the neck all-in-one mass. The face dark, deep strong  but primate.The eyes are close together and set deep in the face. The nose and mouth are human like, it''s nose is wide, around the mouth black hair that went down on each side.It looks up with its head and chest see me, eyeball to eyeball as I look back trying to see if this thing is real. Humanlike in appearance, the face is not like a primate but has a distinct animal presence (the eye are close together). I was never so scared in my life and knew had I stayed I don''t think I would of survived the attack.The way it was positioned gave it an explosive start as it decides to chase me down the street. My heart was pounding out of my chest, my eyes had tears in them and with all my might I pedaled as it ran on two legs, then down on its knuckles then back up again. Perhaps for ten yards, I remember how its long hair on its arms moved with each reach,I thank god I was in first gear.

    "  I am 61-yo and have been an outdoorsman all of my life doing numerous backpacking and mountaineering trips in the Cascades and Olympics. I have a degree in psychology from the UW and currently employed as an Investigator. <BR><BR>My 15-yo son and I made camp at twilight off FS road 25,  after doing a recon of the Lewis River area for hunting. It is a rain forest there with huge cedar trees and large moss-covered maples reminding me of the Hoh Rain Forest. We set up camp on the east side of a creek. We had my 4-Runner parked and set up a tent. <BR><BR> After a steak dinner, I made some howls in the manner of the \"Ohio howls\" that I had made that had called in a Squatch at Lake Ozette (report #65667). I am a trained vocalist and can project my voice considerably. After no response, we retired for the evening.<BR><BR> At approx 10 pm, we were awakened by a loud crack of a branch very close to our tent. I jumped out of my bag with a 400-lumen flashlight and searched 360 degrees hoping to spot the culprit. After several minutes and intense searching to no avail, we went back to sleep only to be woken by howls off in the distance to the south of us an hour later. I would guess that the howls were coming from a single individual approx a mile away from us. My son reported that he had heard footsteps later near the tent that night but failed to wake me. <BR><BR> In the morning, my son discovered a single footprint near the tent. I have photos. It is a very wide right footprint approx a size 13 that was very deep (1/2 inch) in the dirt. I am sure the print is still there as it has not rained since drafting this report. Despite a large rock in the near middle of the arch, the print is deep and was not affected by it. I could not make a print at all and I weigh 250lbs.<BR><BR> I have always been keenly interested in Sasquatch and was convinced that they exist after reading Dr. Meldrum''s Where legend Meets Science book.  I have had encounters after mimicking the Ohio Howl with remarkable success. I suspect the government has proof and is keeping it quiet to protect this cryptohominid with wilderness areas (Lone Butte/Indian Heaven). I am studying maps of an area I reasoned to be prime habitat and have a trip planned overland off-trail/road soon. Time to get serious... ",

    " I have recently become very interested in bigfoot research, and based on reports that I found on this website of previous incidents in the area, decided to go to Great Swamp in Rhode Island to look for any evidence of bigfoot. After walking thirty to forty minutes down the main trail beginning from Great Neck Road, I took a smaller path off of the trail for about five minutes. That is when I noticed a young tree that was snapped in half at about six feet off the ground. More noteworthy, however, was a stick formation that I found a little bit farther down the path on a slightly elevated area of land. It was small, maybe three feet high, but constructed in the same woven-looking manner characteristic of other possible bigfoot stick formations. Other than that, I did not find anything else unusual. It may not be extremely compelling evidence, but I figured it was worth telling experts, who could then take it as far as they saw fit.",

    " My girlfriend and I were staying at her parent''s house near Marlborough, New Hampshire.  I am writing on her behalf because of my access to the internet.  I also have an interest in bigfoot related stories and lore and so am familiar with this website.  However, I have not had any experiences or encounters myself.  <BR>This particular night, my girlfriend was startled by an unusual howling scream while watching t.v. at approximately 11:45 p.m. (her father and I were asleep and did not hear anything).  The howling scream seemed to eminate from across the street in an area that is heavily wooded.  At the first scream she thought that she must have heared an injured person''s cry.  There were approximately four screams (although she is unsure about this), each about 5 seconds apart.  After hearing the second scream she went to the front door (about 10'' from her) and stood outside on the stoop where she heard the last two screams.<BR>She estimated the distance to the screams as approximately 400 feet, to the other side of the street where there is a solitary house.  I believe, however, that the screams may have been much farther away.  She says that they were ''very loud'' and stationary, i.e. they didn''t sound louder or fainter with each progressive one.  She also notes that they sounded as if from around the corner of the house, not a clear shot from her to the point of origin.  In other words, she doesn''t beleive that the ''animal'' could have seen her at the front door.<BR>The next day she described what she heard to me and I immediately thought of the recordings from your site.  Her description sounded alike.  After returning from our trip I played the recordings to her (over the phone) and she says, \"identical,\" specifically the 1978 recording from Snohomish County, Washington.   ",

    " Audio Experience only:<BR><BR>Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, wooo....<BR><BR>Sunday, September 12, 2004 at about 03:00 AM<BR>I was woken up from a sound sleep by a very loud noise.  I listened for a while and tried to figure out what could make such a loud, repetitive noise.  It wasn''t a coyote howl or fishercat screach, didn''t sound like any owl I know of, wasn''t a raccoon or tree rodent...  After 15 - 20 minutes, I went to sleep.<BR><BR>My dog woke me with frightened barking at 4:00 AM when the sound was twice as loud and I knew the critter was within 100 feet of the house.  Also, there were two responding calls, one sounded fairly close and one was in the distance.  I got up to make sure the sheep were OK in their pasture with an electric fence around it and there was nothing by the barn where the goats were.  I flashed the light over to the chicken coop and nothing was there either.  I flashed the light throughout the yard and into the trees to see if there was any clue or any danger to the animals.  I saw nothing and while I shone the light, the calls ceased.<BR><BR>All day I asked EVERYONE if they knew of any local animal that made the noise and repeated it all day long.  A friend suggested that I look it up on the internet.  I listened to all sorts of animal vocalizations with no luck.  When I finally typed in the words of the actual sound it was an identical match to this site!!!  I''m not saying I had a bigfoot encounter, but I definately encountered whatever the campers up in Lincoln, NH encountered last summer!!!  There may be a rational explaination and someone may know of an indigenous animal that makes that sound -- and trust that I will still try to find out what it is... but the sound will resonate in my memory -- as it was like no other animal/bird I''ve ever heard.  It was not too fast, nor garbled, it was incredibly loud and clear.  The dog was very nervous.",

    "       I moved to this location in New Hampshire  in 2001. I have had several sightings over the past few years. Usually from my living room while I am watching television. I know this sounds weird. But, I am serious. My couch sits facing my picture window. Beyond the picture window, there is a small creek and an empty wooded lot. I have seen deer, bear, turkey, racoons, moose and fox on my property.  It is in a part of Gilford called Gunstock Acres. It usually happens in the late evening on a dark summer night. No paticular date or time. From the ground to the top of the window has got to be at least 10 feet tall. This creature is about 9 feet in height. Dark deep brownish long hair, and walks upright, similar to a human. I have seen it go one direction, then go past the window in the other direction several minutes later, or it just walks away until the next time I see it, which has been about once a year. I have seen it looking more like a shadow when my lights in the house are on. I am usually caught off guard, and am startled when I''ve seen it, in disbelief, but there is no other explanation. <BR>      Last summer I happened to tell my husband and family that I saw Bigfoot again last night and my oldest son said he seen it the night before, passing by the window, and it looked right in at him as it was passing by. He described the same creature except that he saw the face. And he swears it is a Bigfoot too.  He was creeped out about it, and I think he still is. My son is in his 20''s.<BR>      This is part of the Great North Woods, with lakes, mountains, rivers & caves. Plenty of places to hide. I have heard strange grunting noises, tree limbs breaking, screams, and walking sounds through my wooded lot. I refuse to go outside after I have seen it, and turn all the outside lights on, until I forget about it again. We have seen some huge prints out there in the winter going around the house, but they were unidentifiable.  Due to the large amounts of snow we have gotten during storms, the tracks get filled in.<BR>      I am spooked by it, but it hasn''t done anything to any of us, except  look in the window at us.<BR>      I know what I have seen, and I haven''t told many people as they would think we were crazy. So, my family and I would like to know what this creature is, and is it possible that it is a Bigfoot? We beleive it is, as we know what we have seen. It can''t be a black bear, as this is too tall, and walks a distance on two legs and like a human, so it couldn''t be a moose either.  It is built like a really large broad-shouldered man, and muscular, but covered in hair. My son said that the face is hairy also, but the skin on the face is a lighter color than the rest of the body. ",

    "Woman recalls scary night while at a Girl Scout campground in Bear Brook State Park",
    :otherstories
    "Around midnight, a group of my friends around the same time, along a long stretch of desolate section of Deerfield Rd in middle of Bear Brook State Park. Drove car around curve & thought it was a gorilla Halloween costume standing in the middle of the road. It was about 8'' tall slightly stooped over half turned staring at the headlights. Then it turned straight & strided toward the edge of the road. There was no path on either side of the road just very thick woods & underbrush. We have stone walls everywhere here in NH. The creature never broke stride as it stepped lithfully over the stone wall & slid with ease through the thick under-brush. A human would have to bend down to use hands to clumsily straddle the stonewall, to get to the other side. There are no houses to \"trick-or-treat\". And who would be out in the middle of nowhere, in the near freezing (35*) cold, just mosying through the thick pickerbrush in a hairy costume?!?!?! We had never heard of bigfoot, didn''t know such a thing existed.There is also a family up in the woods of the Gilmanton area who have had Bigfoot visits for years. They leave out leftovers every so often & get thank you gifts in the next couple days. They can''t use the gifts so wrap them up & dispose of them discretely, in town, so the bigfoots don''t know, so no hurt feelings. NH is squatchy.",

    " In one part of Bearbrook State Park is the Girl Scout Day Camp location. Across the street from New Rye Rd is the Camping Museum & the Snowmobile Museum. There used to be a nature museum. If you keep going straight on that dirt path, you wind yourself up into the Girl Scout Campground. It was a 2 week event. The older campers were allowed to have a single overnight in the last few days. It was ''67/''68, late July. There were 3, 5-person tents, I was a senior and in the tent closest to the woods. The evening was spent cooking hotdogs & hamburgers & marshmallows & sa''mores with lots of singing laughing & screaming. We all retired around 10 pm. In the middle of the night, around 1 or 2 am, I was woken by something softly grunting & pushing down on the top of the tent. We have racoons but no bears in (I get the irony) Bear Brook State Park. The other girls in my tent were trying to stay quiet, but still panicking not so quietly. I said \" it''s just one of the other girls.\" I am a camper since age 9 with a father who was a practical joker. So I said loudly \"That''s not how you do it. This is how it is done\" & I dug my nails into the canvas & making a roaring growling sound clawed down the canvas hard & fast & hit something soft but solid on the outside of the cloth. I was picturing a man''s hand/fist kind of like knuckles???. There was a loud grunt/growl & crashing away from us through the underbrush just on the other side of the tent. Now the girls in my tent are screaming hysterically about bears, The rest of the campers are opening my tent and all pandemonium broke loose. No-one admitted to playing a prank. & the leaders in the other 2 tents all day insisted everyone was accounted for & no one had left the tents not even a potty run. There was a funky smell though, that no-one could recognize. The park rangers swore there were none in the area, they were all up north for the summer. We had never heard of bigfoot, I fear I am repeating myself, so didn''t even know such a thing existed. So, unexplainable incident, that with hindsight, I am thinking, could it have been??? The entire area, for square miles, has always been swarming w/ deer, even still, today.",

    " Well it was a few weeks ago in Loudon, NH.  Me and my wife had just settled into a house nestled next to a farm.  It was night time no real overcast or anything.  From inside the house we heard what we thought was barking constantly.  We own several dogs so we were used to it.  this continued for about an hour or two then quieted down.  Later on that evening about 2am or so we heard the most bloodcurdling sound ever.  The only way i can describe it is like about 20 dogs all screaming and yaulping at once in a shrill chorused scream.  We haven''t heard it again but it came from across the farmer''s field in the woods across from The speedway.  I''d have to say the date was around January 10th or so.  We have heard other things too and seen plenty of deer...but never heading across the field.  We don''t know what it was and did not see it at all.  We have seen shadows move down the dirt road we live on but figured it was just someone walking up the road. Maybe we''re just paranoid...but i''ve lived in the woods here a long time and never heard anything like that before.",

    " My boyfriend and two sons (age 5 & 10) were camping in Upton, Maine.  On July 3rd, 1998 we took a ride into Parmachenee Lake.  The road to get there is off Rt. 16 in Wilsons Mills, ME.  We drove around most of the day, stopped for a cookout on someones lot and then headed out in the early afternoon.   It was before 4:00 p.m.   We were riding in a truck, my friend driving and the two boys in the middle and I was on the passenger side.   We came out of what I would call a wooded area at the top of a small hill, the hill rounded a small corner and then straightened out at the bottom.  The entire area on the right side was an open area at the bottom, the left side was wooded.  There were no vehicles around there or anywhere for that matter.   Just as we rounded we could see at the very bottom of the slight downgrade (approx. 100-150 yds).   We both saw it at the same time.  He looked at me immediately and said \"what did you just see\", I looked at him and without even thinking and said \"saskatchewan\".   <BR>What we saw was something unimaginable.   The creature (?) was standing on two legs, was very tall (approx. 7 feet), skinney and was totally covered with long brown hair/fur.  What was amazing was this creature never even acknowledged that we were coming towards him in the truck, although we were not close enough to hit it, it never acknowledged.   The other amazing thing was that it''s strides were huge.  It took it probably three strides to cross the dirt road, which was wide enough for two vehicles.   It''s gait was very stoic.   We got down to the bottom within seconds, we slowed right down almost to a stop and looked into the woods.   There was nothing in there.   My boyfriend wanted to stop but I wouldn''t let him because of the children.  We also stopped discussing it at that time in fear of scaring the kids.  There were no tracks on the ground.   We intended to return the next day to see if we could track anything but it rained really hard that night so we figured any tracks were gone.<BR>I told this story to very few people because I know it''s hard to believe.   I did tell one of the foresters that worked where I did.   This road we went on is gated and I was able to get a key from my employer.   This is why I mentioned it to the forester.  I was hoping maybe he had heard similar stories.    <BR>The creature was on Bose Buck Mountain and headed towards Aziscohos Lake.   Also in that area was an old gate near mile marker #12.<BR><BR><BR>",

I couldnt make out what it was. It was definitely taller than 7ft and stood on two legs. It had orangish eyes. I started walking back down the road towards my house and when I would stop it would stop an look at me. I would walk some more, so would the thing and then once I stopped it stopped and would look at me.

    " I was hiking in the woods, doing occasional whoops and wood knocks to try to illicit a response. It felt so squatchy from the moment I got there, but I got no response to anything. I was about an hour into my trek and I see off the beaten path a series of footprints. The snow had stopped yesterday and I tell you these prints were FRESH. I am thinking I just missed that squatch by a matter of minutes or hours! SO CLOSE! Well, let me tell you what!! These things were 12'''' long and the stride between steps was measured at 8 feet! The line of prints was straight, just like you see with other evidence of a bigfoot trail! It was INSANE. There were no other prints around, I followed these about a quarter mile into the depths of the woods and off the beaten path. The snow was up past my knees at some points but how could I stop following this epic trail! I could see some prints more clearly than others, I could see toe outlines and the heel in a few! I have pictures and videos to share with you. By the looks of the size of the prints and the distance in stride, this seems like an adult sasquatch, These things were huge!! The sun was setting and my phone was dying so to my dismay I had to turn around and get back to the path before dark, otherwise I would have followed those tracks until they lead me to whatever made them, and we know what made those beasts! This is the BEST day ever. My very first bigfoot evidence and experience and I couldn''t be happier!!! There is literally NOTHING else this could be, it is an amazing and documented bigfoot footprint trail!<BR><BR>",

    "  In the spring of 1974 my girlfriend and I were returning from a motorcycle rally at Laconia NH.It was late at night and we decided to camp out.I found a small gravel road and we found a remote place to set up my small 2 man tent.This area is referred to as the pine barrens in the Kennebunk area of Maine.It has very thick scrub pine growth. <BR> About an hour or so after camping I could hear movement near the tent but was not too concerned because there is a lot of wildlife in the barrens.The movement got closer and there was this really pungent order.I thought \"uh-oh it''s a bear\"but was still not concerned as black bears are mostly just curious and usually will not bother you.<BR> I should add here that I have spent a lot of time in the woods as my mother and father were both Maine guides and the woods was my life.I have heard all the noises that wildlife makes in different seasons.I consider myself a good tracker and know the habits etc. of most animals.<BR> Then it happened:Whatever it was let out a scream that made every hair on my body stand striaght out and nearly gave me a heart attack.I am saying to myself\"this is no bear.\"Now the girlfriend is awake and in hysterics.I am trying to quiet her so I can keep track of whatever it is.It moved close enough to the tent so I could actually feel it''s movement through the ground and hear it breathing.This activity went on for about 20 minutes and it went away.<BR> After a sleeplees night and at first light I crawled out to investigate.I looked for tracks.There were no clear imprints,only impessions in the grass and some broken ferns etc.The impessions were about half again as big as my own.I wear a size 11.I followed the tracks and they ended at a cliff that was about 30 feet high.I wanted to investigate further but the girlfriend was haveing none of it and wanted to leave.I went back a couple of times by myself to that area but never found any further signs in the area.<BR> This all would have been disturbing enough but that year I was liesurly sipping a beer an watching a documentry on bigfoot with my girlfriend when they played a recording that was supposed to be a bigfoot scream.YOu guessed it...Hair straight out and and an exclamation from both of us of \"Oh sh--!\"If that was bigfoot then we have been very close to him.",

    " Had a sighting yesterday. Oxford County, Maine. Was in the power lines clearing that runs through a friends land cutting a downed tree out of the atv trail. Was with 2 friends who asked me how far the land goes and if anyone lives down there. They had a sort of 1000 yard stare down the power lines. I look up to see what they were looking at and about 200 yards down the powerlines we see a massive bipedal creature walking towards us. It stopped when it noticed us and took a fast left turn into the woods. <BR><BR>From the power lines to the road is roughly 400 ft of woods and has a trail about 30 feet behind where we saw the creature that goes straight to the road. I jumped on the 4 wheeler and made a straight shot down that trail to the road to try and get a closer view. It was completely gone. Made 400 ft through the woods and across the road out of sight in less than 2 minutes. <BR><BR>While investigating the sand on the side of the road for prints we heard a short howl followed by 2 sets of 3 tree knocks.",

    " I am a Ph.D. environmental physiologist working for Natick Labs in Massachusetts. In the fall of 1970, I was hunting on the east side of the lake [Long Pond] in Baxter State Forest with Danny Wolfe, a vet now in Ohio, a friend from Montana (deceased) and another vet. One morning I hunted alone south of the lake, when I encountered a strange musky smell in the woods along with a foot-long black scat that looked human except for the extraordinary thickness and width. I also observed small scat that looked like a large pile of baby feces with white and yellow texture. As I proceeded on, I was confronted with the sound of thumping like a partridge on steroids drumming. The ground actually shook. The hair on my neck was raised and the pit of my stomach seemed suddenly queasy as the rotten smell got worse. Suddenly, a large dead tree came crashing down about a hundred yards in front of me. This scared the s... out of me, as the woods were deathly quiet, no wind, no birds etc. I returned to camp and was severely guffawed by the two vets, Dr. Heisel and Dr. Wolfe.<BR><BR> Wolfe, however, agreed to accompany me the next day. We went further into the swampy woods, saw yesterday''s scat and Danny said whatever it was it was certainly big to push that dead tree down. We continued until the area became quite rocky with boulders larger than our heads on all sides. Danny said this doesn''t look like a good place to be because something could jump us before we could react. Suddenly, we encountered the drumming and ground shaking again. This was followed by a huge rock, which flew over our heads and impacted on a hill to our left. Needless to say, we were both speechless and Danny said whatever could throw a fifty-pound rock fifty yards was not something he would care to encounter. Even though Danny had a 7 mm mag and I had a 270, we both agreed to leave.  It was quite evident that whatever we had pissed off was clearly warning us not to go further.  We returned to camp and my two friends became believers. <BR><BR>The hunt was a failure because there were no signs of deer or even moose in the area. We have enjoyed retelling this story to our kids and friends over the years because none of us had ever experienced anything like it in years of hunting in Me, NH, MA, Montana or Colorado. It was the scariest thing I have ever encountered in my hunting career. <BR><BR>I have shot elk in Colorado and this year my wife and I shot over fifty pheasants and five deer. I am on the Board of Advisors of the Uxbridge Rod and Gun club, and as the Army''s former expert on desert survival and heatstroke physiology (Editorial Board of Wilderness and Environmental Medicine; I wrote the survival manual for Desert Storm and Desert Shield). I have published over 200 scientific papers, abstracts, and book chapters. But this is the first time I have written about this strange encounter! I am 65 and have retired from Army Environmental Medicine as a lab director.<BR>",

    " Background:  I have spent a large part of my life in the woods between Eddington where I grew up and Deblois where my Grandfather built a hunting / fishing camp in the 1920s  everywhere in between hunting, fishing, camping and hiking.  I have walked those woods since I was 4 years old and Im now 61  I know the deer, moose , bear and other wildlife of those woods.  I built my camp on Spectacle Pond in Osborn in 1988.  I have spent a lot of time in the years since exploring the woods and waters around the camp over the years and know the area between Route 179 and Route 193 better than most and within 10 miles of my camp, better than anyone.  Since 2008 when I retired from the U.S. Navy, I have spent one month every year at my camp  2 weeks in May, fishing and 2 weeks in November, hunting.  I have spent many days and nights in the most remote areas of that part of Maine.<BR><BR>On the evening of November 12th  2020, my wife and I had returned to our camp after an afternoon deer hunt, it was dark by the time we got back to camp and settled in for a routine evening with getting the camp warmed up, supper, a couple hands of cribbage and talking  we had been in camp for 10 days.  At around 8:30 my wife decided to go to bed as we planned to hunt the morning.  I picked up my book and was reading until 10:30.  The only light within a half mile of my camp was the single gas light in the front room of the camp which I was using to read  the nearest people were 0.5 mile away in their camp back toward Route 9.  I decided to call it a night at 10:30 and wanted to relieve myself before I went to bed so I went outside across the porch, down the front steps and walked approximately 15 feet to the back outside corner of the camp.  Within seconds of standing in that spot there was two very loud THWACK sounds just inside the woodline which is 15 yards across the back yard.  It took me by surprise as Ive never heard that sound before completely by myself in the woods.  It sounded identical to someone taking a large stick of firewood and hitting a tree in full swing.  I could easily replicate that noise as in knocking snow/ice off firewood against a tree, but with force.  I did not have a flashlight with me as the diffused light from the gas light inside the camp gave me enough point of reference to get back inside so I didnt think to bring one with me.  I stood there perplexed as to what I had just heard and trying to make sense of it, when it happened againTHWACK but this time a little farther away  maybe 25-30 yards, but still quite loud.  This repeated itself 10 or 11 times over a period of maybe 2 to 3 minutes, each time a little more distant than before.  I remained standing there as I was still trying to figure out what it was THWACKing these trees.  After the hitting of trees dissipated, I returned to the camp and locked the door  I didnt (and still dont) know what it was but I knew it wasnt a person, moose, deer or bear!  Of note, there was absolutely no light as in a flashlight from a person.  Additionally, those woods are extremely thick with dead spruce and fir  lots of blowdowns yet there was absolutely no noise  no snapping branches, breaking twigs. Nothing  Silence.  I can tell you first hand that nobody could walk down through there in broad daylight, much less at night without a flashlight without snapping branches and making a lot of noise. I spent an additional hour in the camp that night reflecting on what I had heard and trying to attribute it to something that made sense  there was none in all of my experience.  I went to bed and when we got up Friday morning, we decided to hang out at camp to get a start on packing and cleaning as we were closing up camp and leaving on Saturday.  I walked into the woods during daylight where I heard the THWACK noises the night before but found nothing where I expected to see some type of sign.  Needless to say, I didnt tell my wife about those events until Saturday morning as we were getting ready to leave. I still have no idea what it was and it was so dark, I didnt see anything but I can tell you that Ive never heard or experienced anything like that in the many years Ive spent in those woods and the 30+ years Ive owned that camp.

As we approached we could tell that the creature was about the size of a human, was covered with very dark, shaggy hair, and it was sorta hunched over with it''s arms hanging down quite far. it just stood there about a foot ot two into the road watching us and then almost as qucikly as it had happened, it vanished into the trees. <BR><BR>when we drove by i looked into the forest to see if i saw anything, but couldn''t see anything. we went to school and told a few friends and then told out parents later that night. we didn''t think to call the police or anything at the time, although i wish we had.<BR><BR>when we tell people they never believe us because most people don''t believe in \"bigfoot\". i''m glad that this sight is here so that someone might finally believe us. i know what we saw was real and i know that it wasn''t a bear. bears are not shapped like humans and very rarley walk around on two feet",

    " I was not in any way aware that these creatures existed in Maine, firstly. I am from Connecticut however I have spent years in desolate oilfields across the U.S. including places like West Texas, the upper Peninsula of Michigan, and the Everglades of Florida. I have a vast knowledge of wildlife as I have always taken an interest to it and spent years IN the forest. My point is, what I experienced this day has shaken me to the core as I know my encounter was nothing \"normal\". <BR><BR>In the Northwoods of Maine in a town called Greenbush, (population 1,400) I purchased 80 acres of wilderness with virgin forest on the back half of the lot. (meaning not even loggers have been there, it''s that desolate.) I had rented an excavator and for this entire day I had been cutting a road through swamp, hills and forests to a high hill I call Hope Hill on the virgin most desolate corner of my land where I want to build my cabin.<BR><BR>I had made it halfway and in the swamp I realized I was out of fuel. I shut down the machine and get out. I step down onto to road and was admiring my work and just relishing in the whole idea of pioneering this new path. <BR><BR>Suddenly about 50 yards into the tree line I hear a bang with a stick on to a tree. Like someone was hitting a wooden bat against a large tree trunk as the percussion was unmistakable... At first I thought \"Oh crap there is a moose\" because it is mating season for them and they are known to ram their antlers against trees to intimidate their foes. <BR><BR>Suddenly, the sound happens again. Now I am certain this is no moose as no branches are breaking, there is movement, no grunts, nothing... Just this wooden thump just through the trees where I can''t see.<BR><BR>I begin walking further away because I''m obviously freaked out. Again, but now 2 knocks... I grab a large branch I had just ripped down with the machine and smacked it against a large tree trunk. Immediately I received a knock in response. I wait around 45 seconds.... I knock again, BANG it knocks right after me again... I knock again 5 seconds later, it responds again right back.... <BR><BR>Now I am shaking because I know what I presume this creature to be. It''s obviously strong because the bang was very loud. Intimidating... I knew there was a certainty I was interacting with Sasqauch. <BR><BR>I went back to my trailer on my qaud which was parked about 200 feet down the trail. I FLEW home. I calm down, now I am questioning reality and am quite, scared I guess. This is my land, I''m only halfway through making the road, these are my thoughts, so I decide to ride back...<BR><BR>I knock again. It responds. I take my phone out. Turn on record on video, I knock, it goes away... Almost as if it knew I was recording. Regardless it was incredibly perplexing. I got back on the quad and went back home knowing for sure what I just experienced was legitimate.<BR><BR>I brought a feather bead string thing from a dream catcher and brought it out there as a gift. It''s been 3 days. I haven''t gone back to see if it''s still there.",

I (Brian) went fishing going down steam while Carla and Cindy walked up river, I walked around a bend I saw a big tree that looked like lightning hit it, but while looking at it better, steam was coming off it, then the top foot and a half turned slowly to where I saw the whites of its eyes, his hair looked like bark, he was squatting, sitting on it heals with knees to its chest, it really looked like a tree broken off. A little one,  a 6 footer, jumped over some rocks and logs and was gone, the big one sitting on its heels was 7-to 8 foot, 3-4 feet wide, It was not scared of me, I ran up river to find the girls, found them and said I wanted to show them something weird, as us three went back, sure enough it was still there.

    " I took a 3 day/2 night solo backpacking trip in Washington state, up the Ape Canyon Trail, around the base of Mt. St. Helens, and through the Muddy River drainage this past July 5th through 7th.   On the  first day of the hike at around 1 pm, as I made my way up the Ape  Canyon Trail, I was surprised to hear a series of \"whooping\" calls, a  series of 5 whoops in a row spaced at intervals of about 30 seconds to  1 minute apart, 5-7 sets over the course 10-15 minutes.  The calls (bwaaahh-bwaaahh-bwaaahh) sounded as if they were emanating  from the bottom of an oil drum, the tone being deep and bodily palpable, even though sounding maybe a mile or more away in the direction of the canyon, and somewhat north of the trail. It struck  me as unnaturally deep and projecting (although not overly loud) and unlike any animal call I had ever heard before (I have hiked and camped in forest and wilderness areas for many years).  I did not hear any  other calls during course of my hike, save what sounded like an  enormous owl hooting near my tent site on the edge of the Muddy River drainage on my 2nd night, at around 2 am.  It was very loud and I was not inclined to get out of my tent for a look-see.  One other thing I found intrigued me though.  On a game trail that slips off of the main trail, just down hill from a ground spring adjacent to the trail 1-2 miles from the trailhead, I came across a couple of downed trees approx. 4-5\" in diameter, twisted or snapped off and laying across the trail in a cross-x pattern. The trees were placed on the trail between the spring and a small meadow farther down the hill.   There were no signs of a lightening strike, no evidence of chopping or sawing was apparent, and the trees looked otherwise healthy and normal, and looked as if they had been pulled over and broken off toward the top of the tree.",

    " When I was about 10 years old my father took me and a friend camping up in Indian Heaven. We parked and then hiked about 3 miles uphill to Lake Wapiki there. It was beautiful mid August and hot. While hiking up to the camp spot I remember having a sense of someone looking at me from the forest. I do have a big imagination though so I didn''t think to much about it.<BR> We arrived at our camp spot and set everything up. We were camping next to a large dried up creek bed and I remember looking at it and following it a little ways down. Picking huckleberries and exploring the rest of the area, I spent the rest of my day just having fun.<BR>  That night, after I and my friend and Dad had gone to bed, we were awakened by a stampede of deer or elk or something. There were at least 10 because it lasted about 20 to 30 seconds and they were running right through our camp. Scared the hell out of me. I remember my Dad getting up and making sure we were all right. Everything was fine and so I slowly fell back asleep.<BR> Next morning I woke up and looked around and it looked like some of our cooking gear was scattered about the camp, probably from the stampede running right through. And then I saw it what makes me believe in Bigfoot. There in the dried creek bed was a huge footprint. And i''m not talking about a human print. Though this foot print could have been made by a man, it was way too big and wide. I estimate a size 20 and it was like 4 to 5 inches across. Huge foot print. Scared me half to death.<BR> I was thinking about it and I think a bigfoot had scared the deer or elk into the stampede. So there is my story about bigfoot. I believe 100% in bigfoot. I know this story isn''t all that. It''s not like I saw him or anything but what i saw made me believe.<BR><BR>   <BR>",

    " I put together a mountain bike trip with a cousin for a weekend in Central Vermont near the town of Plymouth in the Calvin Coolidge state forest. <BR><BR>We decided on a Lean-To shelter called TinkerBrook on the outskirts of the forest near the backside of Killington Peak. One reason for this location was because of the steep topography the area offered for a mountain biker. Also, not to many people visit this shelter according to the Rangers I''ve talked to before due to the hike in and lack of 4x4 access as well. The place offers nothing more than a view of a steep forested ravine. The shelter is right on the edge of this ravine as well.<BR><BR>We travelled up Shrewsbury road which intersects RT100 south of Plymouth and then heads west almost straight up the nearest mountain in a series of switchbacks. We then parked our vehicle on the bend in the road where tinkerbrook shelter trail starts. The trail/road is heavily blocked off by boulders and easy to miss. We packed up the bikes and headed down the old trail/road to the shelter. The shelter is about a 3/4 mile off the forest road we parked the vehicle on.<BR><BR>We set up camp for the night in the shelter and did a look around. The place offered no trails to ride on and the ravine was so steep that you needed to climb out of it using the roots of the trees in it. The place was very isolated.<BR><BR>We headed off to bed around 9:00pm and left a campfire going near the opening of the shelter. A few hours later (12:00am) my cousin woke me up saying that he was hearing and feeling knocks on the shelter. I told him to go back to sleep. Then I heard and felt the noises myself.<BR><BR>The sounds were like something big pushing against the shelter. I thought it could of been a moose or bear and decided to go around back to see. I took a flashlight and went around back within a minute of hearing the noise again. There was nothing there to see.<BR><BR>This continued a few more times during the night until maybe 3:00am. I felt the bumping sounds near my side of the shelter on occasion. We didn''t get much sleep and at one point I even pulled all the firewood close to the opening to keep a large fire going.<BR><BR>In the morning we looked for any damage to the shelter and found nothing. We also looked around for any sign on the ground (footprints, loose rocks, scrapes and hoofmarks) but found nothing.<BR><BR>We decided not to stay another night and headed out. <BR><BR>",

    " I research mountain lions in NH, but I was caring for my mother and hadn''t gotten out since Christmas Day, 2014. On 5/24/15 I decided to just go for a walk, no research. I did a Meet-up with someone who walked much faster than me. She left me at the power line. I was way downhill, but was determined to at least make it to the power line. <BR>I did, but when I turned back to go down to the car, I saw two huge prints near a tree by the trail. When I got to them, the heels were 3-4 inches deep in the soil and leaves. They touched and the toes went out and away from each other like a duck''s feet. They seemed to be 15 inches long, but it was hard to tell with all the leaves, unevenness, grass, etc. I took photos and measurements (even on a walk I take a camera and tape measure). <BR><BR>It was interesting as hiding by that tree the Futures Trail went right past the tree, above was the power line and behind the tree was the park road, so that it was an advantageous hunting spot as animals coming from six different directions could easily be hunted down.<BR><BR>Going back to the car, I saw two more tracks to the right of the trail. One was about 10 inches. The other seemed to be 15 inches, but with a 10 inch track inside it. The toes were 5 inches across for the three toes that were embedded in the bank. The other toes were over the hardened trail. There was also a 5x6 inch parallelogram shape. I kick myself now as I didn''t take a photo. <BR><BR>Later I saw a knuckle-walking gorilla on TV and thought, \"That''s what that was!\" It was a knuckle print and also was very deep. <BR><BR>At the bottom I asked the ranger to do a casting and he said I could instead, so I bought plaster of Paris. It wasn''t enough. I had to go back several days later (rain). <BR><BR>The casts are awful. There were too many leaves, the toes broke off, etc. <BR><BR>The interesting part was that the park ranger acknowledged the report with a \"Yeah, we get lots of reports of bigfoots, but we try to keep it on the down low.\" <BR><BR>When I asked him about mountain lion sightings, he seemed scared and said, \"You think there are mountain lions up there?\"<BR>It was odd that bigfoot was \"normal\" and mountain lions were \"strange\"!<BR><BR>When I came back, I heard from someone else that this same ranger had been followed down the hill by something he nicknamed Roy. He was hoping it was a bigfoot and not a lion. Part of his job is to clear the trails and make sure everyone is off the mountain. That night it got dark, and he was also \"helped\" off the mountain, though \"it\" always stayed the same distance behind him.",

    " Nov. 1984 between 12:00& 1:00AM The night my niece was born.There was a snow storm, my brother-in-law had a custom car and wanted to go home to milton to switch to his older car because of the sudden snow. My husband, brother-in-law, nephew 3yrs old & myself, drove from milton, we were headed to my house in Winooski. we got as far as Clochester when the snow got real bad and the car slid into a ditch,my newphew began to cry&scream, so we flaged down a truck to bring me&my nephew to my house to call a tow truck. I Left my husband&BROTHER-IN-LAW in Colchester. My husband said while they were waiting they started to hear noises in the woods, like trees breaking,than they heard something that was coming in thier dirction but the it was stomping on two legs they could breaking trees,coming closer,my husband is a hunter and he said you could tell it was walking on two legs they backed away from the side of the road to the other, couldnt run because the road was to slippery <BR>and they only had on sneakers. meanwhile it kept on getting closer, it was starting to part the trees when the tow truck came and they heard it running back into the woods breaking every thing in its path My husband was very scared , they both were &told me what had happened. I HALF believed them.<BR>The next day I drove threw the same place & looked around as I drove I saw fields and woods and thought that it looked to peaceful and really thought they were nuts. I HAD TO PICK UP MY HUSBAND IN MILTON. I had my daughters with me 10 and 13, I WAS PREGNANT at that time, anyway I got to Milton ,latter that night we headed back to Winooski, well wouldnt you know it, it started to snow realy hard like the night before and it was 12:00am. <BR><BR>We started to go threw the same spot as the night before and I started to tell my husband about me looking around earlier and that there was nothing ...... When there it was, it just crossed the road and started to go up a hill ,it was staring at us with one  foot on a wire fence holding the wire down with its arm and just staring at us, it was not brown but white with yellow dirty streaks and his eyes, oh how they scared me, they were reflecting a yellow/amber color  like the yellow on causion lights, huge man, it was at least 10 ft. tall arms very long ,his fur was long, on his face the only flesh part that didnt have fur was his eyes,upper cheeks. My husband started to slow down to get a better look, thats when I freaked out and started to hit my husband because I was so scared & my girls were screaming so we kept on going I just kept on thinking about its eyes and was afraid so we wandered if they know its there and we dont want to get shot looking. <BR>",

    " The sighting was today (8/6/19) at 10:15 am at our VT summer cabin. <BR><BR>I am 67, retired RN & former private pilot with excellent vision- 20/15, so I was not mistaken. It was not a bear. We have had a bear here by the deck, so I know what bears look like standing up to the reach feeder. <BR><BR>It was sunny day. My small Chihuahua mix was out front in her cage. She was barking so I walked out to front deck and looked towards dirt road where she was looking. We sit back approx.125ft from the road. <BR><BR>I saw a very black humanoid shape walking on two legs go past our driveway. It was half bent over then straightened up. It had  longs arms swinging. The head was turned away & appeared to have very short neck & roundish head from that angle. <BR><BR>I said to myself, \"That looks like a chimp!\". I watched for it for approx.12 seconds until it disappeared behind trees going east on road.  There are spots that I can see thru the trees to the neighbors drive, so I was looking for it to either go up the drive or continue on road. When it did not, I walked out to end of drive, approx. 200 ft. ( w/ my air horn). There was nothing on the road for some distance.<BR><BR>Later in day I went out to that area with my small dog. She refused to even walk and was trembling. This is the same dog that almost went thru a screen door to attack the bear by our feeder a few weeks ago. I noticed an area of bent weeds that would have been where the creature had exited our woods, going into a small ditch then back up to get onto road before walking past our drive. On the roadside, in the direction I saw it going,  there were 3 barefoot heel depressions w/ faint toe marks approx. 12 inches long.  The area was dry with fine gravel so not a clear print.<BR><BR>The week before, I had heard twigs snapping & weeds moving behind my fenced garden. This approx. 40 ft from the front porch where I often sit. The dog barked. The noise stopped then started again, so I fired off my air horn which I always have near after an encouter with a large coy-wolf.<BR><BR>The cabin sits about 100ft  above the N. Branch Lamoille River. There are many snowmobile & ATV trails plus the Long Trail is only 1/5 miles. It was very wooded and remote. A few homes and camps on our road.",

    " On Saturday afternoon on August 4, 2018 at approximately 2pm my boyfriend and I were driving from Berlin to Woodbridge about halfway there I was staring out the passenger side window as my boyfriend was driving. In a clearing of the woods I saw what looked to be an extremely tall man with shoulder length dirty blonde hair. <BR>As I focused in I realized this 8 ft tall creatures arms, chest and legs were also covered in the same long dirty blonde hair. He was walking north with the back of his hands facing forward, swaying like a gorilla as he walked on two legs. <BR><BR>As we passed him I jumped out of my seat and turned around and kept my eyes locked on him as long as I could.

    "There was a time when I was delivering newspapers very early in the morning. I took a shortcut down a path through some woods and I could barely see anything. I came around a corner in the path and got scared because I saw what I thought was some large dark person laying down next to the path taking a rest and looking at me. I could not discern any features and could not tell if it was a log or a person, but something made me stop and stare. I kept blinking trying to get the nerve to get closer, but I could not see clearly enough. I went back the way I came. Since this was a path I used regularly I couldn''t remember if a log was there or what that could have been. This might not be worth mentioning.",

    " My friend and I were out late on a saturday night visiting some girls.  We didn''t have a car and we had walked about 7 or 8 miles to arrive.  We were both on the JV soccer team at our highschool and even though the season was over we were in very good shape.  For this reason we jogged maybe half the trip which got us there in time for saturday night live.  We stayed long enough for me to watch SNL with one girl and my friend to spend some private time with his beau.  It got to be late and we knew we had a long trip back to his place.<BR><BR>I felt fine and wanted to leave after awkwardly watching TV with this girl.  Getting to this location was easy because it was mostly downhill, but getting back was going to take longer. We were still in good shape so we jogged most of the way back up the long hill on Town Hill Rd.(219) near Bakersville, but in New Hartford, CT.<BR><BR>It was a crisp night without much moonlight. We had grown comfortable jogging side by side in the middle of the road.  Since it was so late nobody was out driving and we set a consistent pace for about 2 hours.  We finally made it to the top of the long hill where Route 219 flattens out.  We were casually jogging in the middle of the road past houses and an occasional farm when we heard a bad sound.<BR><BR>It made us stop dead in our tracks and we were both frightened.  It came from the left of the road perhaps behind a farm and a fair distance away.  I distinctly remember turning my head as the sound swept from left to right and thinking to myself that is a big sound.<BR><BR>I would like to comment on the sound.  I have spent alot of time in the woods of Connecticut and was familiar with sounds from area wildlife including birds, squirrels, coyotes, dogs etc.  I immediately asked my friend \"What the f!$# was that?\"  He responded that he did not know.  From the left, the sound was a cry that sounded like a cross between a baby and a woman screaming bloody murder that started very high, held for a number of seconds, and then came down in pitch.  When it got lower it changed into a broken cackle that made the echoes more pronounced.  It was very disturbing and unlike anything we had ever heard.  I asked my friend if he wanted to stay and check it out but he was very disturbed and did not want to hang around.  It was a bad sound that you don''t want to hear in the middle of night.  We stood there for a few moments confused and scared, and decided to get going.<BR><BR>We continued jogging for another hour discussing along the way what it could be.  Eventually we became more relaxed and the conversation moved onto other things like the events earlier in the evening.  Things were fine again and we were making good progress over a few more miles when we heard the sound again, this time on the right side of the road and closer.<BR><BR>Again it was a blood curdling scream that held for a few seconds, slowly descended in pitch and cackled at the end, but on the other side of the road and closer.  We were now more scared and both had the feeling we were being followed or tracked.    I turned to my friend and said pointedly that we might not get another chance like this again and I grabbed his arm.  In panic he cocked his right arm back and said some expletives to the extent that if I did not let go he would lay me out flat right there.  He sprinted down the road without me and I had no choice but to follow him since I lost sight of him in the dark.  I caught up with him soon enough and we quietly jogged the remainder of the distance to his house though we were shaky.<BR><BR>For years he was not open to talking about what we heard and he apologized for threatening me and leaving me standing there.  When it was discussed we never came to a decision about what it was.<BR><BR>A few years ago I came across the BFRO website and started reading reports.  I listened to a few audio recordings from OHIO but nothing clicked until I read reports of screams.  The recordings on the site are like moans and long whoops, but some reports describe a more stressed vocalization that puts the listeners instantly into panic- this is what we heard.  Its a really really bad sound that is confusing because it sounds sort of familiar, but is so extreme its difficult to describe.  The reports I have read that describe the scream include hunters and military folks who pretty much bolt when they hear it.<BR><BR>Since this happened I have worked professionally in molecular genetics and neurobiology at UCONN and Yale University.  I have also had careers in the financial industry as a quantitative analyst, and as a sound designer and audio engineer to the musical instrument industry.<BR><BR>Whatever made the sound was able to project over a great distance, and kept up with us over enough miles to convince us we were being stalked.  I cannot say for sure what made the sound, but based on: other credible reports in the BFRO database, the similarity to other screams and our own responses, a sasquatch is my best candidate without invoking the supernatural which I personally would never do.<BR><BR>Looking in the database for reports from Connecticut, the only one I found was surprisingly in the same County - Litchfield.",

When I brought the fish to shore I heard 3 distinct knocks coming from behind and above me. There is a rather steep, high (30 ft?) slope along the access road near the boat ramp. I turned around thinking it was people walking down the road.  Nothing there...  I threw the fish back and recast.  I caught another within a few minutes.  As i brought this one to shore, I heard another 3 distinct knocks from the same spot and again turned around to see if someone was there.  No one! This boat launch/pond is about 4 - 5 miles in from the main road and the only houses around were on the other side of the pond, the opposite direction of the knocks.  I am pretty sure it was an encounter with Sasquatch even though I did not see or smell one.  The knocking was too \"human\" to be an animal and there were NO people around.",

    "   This sighting happened when I was a young boy of about seven or eight years of age. It was a cloudy fall day. I was playing near a window in a second story farm house when something caught my eye. I watched as a hairy nine-foot creature walked up hill across the front yard. It had a huge stride, as if it were in a hurry. It kept looking back as it walked with its long swinging arms. When it turned its head it had to also turn its shoulders to be able to look at a 90-degree angle. I stood watching it walk along when it apeared to look up and make eye contact with me for only a second. It never broke its stride. It''s eyes glowed like a raccoon or a cat at night when light is shined in their eyes. What frightened me was that it was still daylight. I didn''t get really freaked until it disapeared around the side of the house. That''s when I ran in to the kitchen were my parents were playing cards with another couple. I tried to get their attention but they didn''t have time for a whiny kid who wanted a cookie or candy. It wasn''t until they escorted me out the front door and slammed it in my face that they figured out something was wrong: There was no way I was going to hang around out side with a monster in the area. I flipped out --screaming, beating,kicking the door  and crying for them to let me in. It was only a couple or three seconds and they knew something was terrible wrong. They let me in and I explained what I had just seen through tears. My father and his friend went outside to look around, probably thinking they would find a loose cow. I''ll never forget the look on their faces when they saw the foot prints that dwarfed their own. My dad''s friend was a tall man of around six foot two or three. When he stretched his legs to step from one foot print to another it was next to impossible. Their disbelief had turned to fear. They did however want to follow the tracks that went across a field that had been plowed recently. I freaked out again. They seemed to understand this time. They decided that going in a car would be better. We drove down a road a short distance, found were it crossed and went on up a hill. The tracks disapeared and that seemed fine with everyone.  ",

    " There is a small pond located in the wildlife management area in Harwinton. I have frequently visited this place throughout my youth, and adulthood to fish, camp, hike, bike, and hunt.<BR>The pond is spring fed, and is located in a flood conroll area. A town built dam at one end helps contoll the water level, but at the time of the incident the dam was poorly built.<BR>In late summer the water level in the pond would drop drastically, and create a higher concenration of fish. The best time to go fishing was at night when temps. were cooler.<BR>On this one particular night I decided to go moonlight topwater bassi''n alone. I parked my car at the entance gate around 9:00pm, and proceeded on foot down the service road. The moonlight was intense, and afforded me the luxury of saving my flashlight batteries for most of the treck. The trip from the road to the pond is approx. 3/4 of a mile, and takes you through several fields wich are cut in the summer.On the way i startled some deer that were around a salt lick, they ran off in the opposite direction of the pond.<BR>I walked through the final field, and over a stone wall, onto a path that leads directly to the spot on the pond where i wanted to fish.The area from the stone wall to the pond is wooded, and recquired use of the flashlight.<BR>The path, and woodline end in an area of land that juts out into the pond, forming a point. Due to the low water level, it was another 50 yds. walk to get to the waters edge. I fished off of a couple of rocks that jutted out even further.<BR>I had been fishing for approximately an hour, and havig some luck. The moon was full, and almost directly overhead. I was out in the wide open, and could see very well all around the shoreline. The woodline around the pond was spaced from the water at least 30yards plus in all directions. The moonlight did not penetrate into the woods, and so I could not see into them. I felt as though I were on center stage to anything that might be in the woods wathing me. All of a sudden out of nowhere a loud and deep sound eminated direclty from the woodline where I had entered the area. My knees went weak, and I nearly fell off the rocks. I turned to face the area in a ducking position trying to see what it was. The sound was again repeated after a short pause, and then nothin. I pointed my flashlight in the direction of the sound,but it was too far and too weak, not even an eyeshine. This was all that I heard.<BR>The sounds were as follows: WWRRUUMMMPFSFSFSFSSS!!-twice in succession, then a short pause (10 sec.) followed by the same WWRRUUMMMPFSFSFSSS!!-Twice in succession.<BR>The sounds were deep, and came from something large, (200+lbs.) They echoed across the pond! They were definitely directed at me, something was letting me know it was there.<BR>I found it odd that pryor to and after, there were no sounds of walking in the woods. Watever this was made a stealthy approach, and exit. I never heard anything again.<BR>I stayed and fished nervously for another hour, and left the area scared but without incident.<BR> <BR>",

    " I have a couple of incidents to report, both took place near Bethel, CT at the property I owned/lived on at the time. <BR><BR>These incidents took place in May of 2013 if I recall correctly. I lived set back in the woods up a long driveway not completely surrounded by forest but mostly. There were a couple houses a hundred or more feet away but I was pretty isolated. <BR><BR>I pulled up to my house in front of my garage. I was facing a small chunk of woods behind an old stone wall that was very brushy and bushy and had a lot of big rocks and uneven ground and it all went slightly up hill. I got out of the car with my 4 and a half month old German Shepherd and she uncharacteristically ran away from me toward the aforementioned stone wall barking very aggressively like a full grown Shepherd in protection mode. I was curious what sort of creature could get her to react like that so I took my flashlight out of the car and shined it in the brush but it was so heavy all I could see was a dark shadow moving about 20 ft or so ahead of me very slowly, sounding almost bipedal, like it wasn''t very afraid but was keeping its distance. Finally it got to somewhat of a clearing but was crouching and hiding behind a tree poking its head out from behind repeatedly. <BR><BR>I wondered what dark bulky figure could have bright reddish orange eyes and move from crouching to standing relatively tall so I initially figured it must have been a black bear and I called my dog inside and went about my business. <BR><BR>The very next night I pulled into the same spot and I had a friend with me and we got out of the car and we both heard a large bellowing roar a couple times and it sounded like it was in the area I saw the \"bear\" the night before. He asked me \"what the f--- is that\" and I said it must have been what I assumed was the bear I encountered the night before. It wasn''t until a few months later when I was watching some videos on sasquatch encounters did I realize what I really saw. Not only that but black bears don''t roar. The roar I heard sounded like vocalization recordings of angry sasquatch and the movements of the head and color of the eyes were exactly as anyone who encountered them had reported. <BR><BR> According to another sasquatch reporting site there was a sighting in the late 70s in the town next to Bethel (Danbury) and a cast was taken of prints. <BR><BR>I firmly believe it was a sasquatch I encountered.",

    " This sighting happened in mid October 1971 in Fairfield, New Jersey.  It was a Saturday, sometime around noon.  <BR><BR>At the time I was 15 and my friend was 16.  We were walking throught a area that is primarily brushy woods, but alot of wet land with only clumps of  tall grass. We were walking in a westerly direction along a feeder stream that fed into the Passic River.  The Passic River is about 1/2 mile north of where we were. The area is quite flat.  The areas on the imediate left and right of the feeder stream had little brush.                <BR><BR>It was partly cloudy, and we were wearing light jackets.  From a distance of aproximetly 75 yards we observed 4 creatures.  The largest was standing on the south side of the stream.  It appeared to be about 8 feet tall, very long arms that went almost to the knees.  Very powerfully built, barrel chested, very wide shoulders.  the head seemed to have a rounded \"peak\".  The color of all 4 was black, the faces seemed somewhat lighter in color, but not white.  The second one was sitting on the ground, the third was lying on the stream bank, and the last was standing in the middle of the stream.  <BR><BR>We observed them for a few minutes.  They also observed us.  We discussed it and decided to run.  We ran back east for a bit until we came to a clear cut for power lines that ran north & south.  We ran south along the clear cut for aproximetly 1/4 mile until we came to Route 80.  <BR><BR>We went home.  The only people we told were our parents.  At no time did we feel threatened by the creatures.  We were used to being in the woods and knew the local fauna.  We both agreed these were not people or bears.  When I later the Patterson film, I felt that these were the same in appearence.<BR>",

    " April 29 2006 about 630pm I just left the Livingston mall and was heading home but got all turned about since I don''t go up that way very often. Anyhow I was figuring that I was north of rt 78 and just kind of \"Lewis and Clarked\" it toward home via the mirror compass in my car and made the first left southbound that I could once I realized I was heading west and didn''t recognize any landmarks. <BR><BR>I turn down this road and notice some construction equipment not far off into the trees on the right side of the road. I was driving slower than normal being unfarmiliar with the area and since I kept peeking at the compass to make sure I was still southbound (looking back it must have been overcast since I would have just used the location of the sun as a reference to direction).<BR>As I was driving along I caught movement out of the corner of my eye and saw a young deer (judging by size) bolt out of the trees across the road from left to right about 100-200 feet in front of my car. I just took my foot off the gas and didn''t need to brake, then I looked left for followers and saw what appeard to be a hunter in a dark colored ghillie suit burst from the trees after the deer. I couldnt make out any details of the face feet or hands but he/it was only around 6 feet tall or so and I''d estimate the low 200lb range but was unusually fast especially for someone dressed like that. The second thought in my head since I fish and shoot a bit was that it couldn''t possibly be legal to hunt around that area since its fairly close to residential zones. Then I noticed that the hunter had no weapons in his hands. I got up to the spot where they crossed and looked right and noticed that the biped (hunter) actually closed ground on the deer and was still in pursuit. I don''t know if the deer stopped to look back at some point as they some times do but this thing was in a full tilt sprint over what I would assume to be uneven ground and didn''t stumble once. I didn''t hear or smell anything since I had my roof up and AC & radio on at the time. All of this happened I would estimate in less than 20 seconds total.",

    " I''m reporting this approximately 10 years after the fact.  My wife had asked me to re-tell my story to her this morning and that is what prompted us to stumble across this web site.  <BR><BR>Late Fall 1997 (or possibly 1996).  I was coming out of my apartment''s laundry facility, which is a seperate building not connected to the actual apartment buildings.  I must have heard something because I looked to my right and there it was, about 20 feet away.  The creture was about 5.5 to 6 feet tall. I''d guess it was aroung 200 lbs. There was no odor and it made no sound.  I saw it as it was rooting through a garbage dumpster.  In a matter of seconds my brain went through a kind of checklist to try to rationalize what I was seeing.  But it was not a bear, it was too slim in relation to its height.  It also moved in a way that was very human.  It was nighttime but there was a parking lot light on overhead.  I could see hair that was brown and about 4-7 inches in length. Unfortunately, primative survival instict and adreneline took over.  I bolted toward my apartment, running so fast that I lost my footing as I was going through a dip in the terrain.  I landed arms first and slid across a gravel covered road.  As I got to my feet I looked over my shoulder to see that it too had run and was about 200 feet from where we had met.<BR><BR>I''m certain it was not an animal that is commonly known to people.  It was humanoid in appearence and movement.  The way it stopped what it was doing, turned its head and looked at me was freaky. Because of shadows I couldn''t get a look at its face.  The incident didn''t change my life or anything.  I hardly ever think about it...unless I look at my elbow.  I scraped it really bad when I fell running, and have a scar to this day.  When I first told this story to my wife she was very taken aback because she knows that I am a very rational and analytic person.  ",

    " On April 15, 2011 my sons and I were camping at Mahlon Dickerson Reservation near Jefferson Township, NJ. The temperature was approximately 52 degrees and the day was overcast. At around 3 PM the three of us struck out from our campsite directly into the timber. There was no overgrowth and the trees were still bare. This is the reason we didnt take any of the marked trails in the area. The terrain is very rocky and over the next hour we hiked and climbed. Circling back into the camp area we emerged at the far end and headed toward the road that runs the length of the campsite.<BR><BR>From our position on the road, immediately to our right would be the beginning of a two-way trail. The lower trail heads off and skirts the bottom of the mountain while the upper trail heads up it. As we got to the road I looked over my right shoulder (Why I did this I still do not know. In other words, there was no noise that I heard or any other reason I can think of that made me turn around). There, at the beginning of the upper trail was a tall bulky black figure. It moved from right to left. Its arms were long and swung in large motions as it walked. The head was dome shaped and very close to the shoulders. In fact, it seemed that it would have had to turn its entire body to look in any direction other than straight ahead.  It walked out of site rather quickly. <BR><BR>I was completely caught off guard when I saw it. My very first thought was why is this guy walking up the trail wearing black from head to toe? Thats when it hit me that no one would. Sure there are hikers and mountain bikers on the trails but not at this time of year during a work day. In fact, we had spent the previous night here and were the only campers on the grounds. There had been no visitors to the grounds the entire day save one woman who came to walk her small dog. The next thought that ran through my mind was how big it was. It did not appear to be exceptionally tall (not eight feet tall anyway) but the sheer girth of the thing was impressive. It seemed to me that it could have wrestled a bear and easily won. <BR><BR>I have to admit that it took me a few seconds to gather my wits once it had moved out of sight. Once I did I told the boys to stay behind me and we moved up to where I had seen it. Once we reached the area I looked to the right where I had first seen it come into view and got another small surprise. I had thought it was walking along the upper trail when I first spotted it. However, that trail began where I had first seen it. The direction it came from was an off trail wooded area. We did follow the trail for about ten minutes but I decided to abandon it and head back to camp when the kids got spooked. On the way back I had my 12 year old, 155lbs, 56 son stand at the top of the trail where I had first seen the thing while I went back to my original spot where I first saw it. Whatever I saw that day was an easy 12 taller and three times bigger around than my son. <BR><BR>Those are the facts. Now, I have to add that my impression of this thing was one of curiosity. I had been having a feeling, not an overwhelming feeling but a feeling none the less, that as we hiked off trail that day we were being watched. I never felt threatened or perceived any danger or I certainly would have moved my boys right out of there. It seems to me that it had been watching us and once we had left its area and gotten back to ours it was more than happy to move on its way. <BR><BR>",

Took one step from the center of my lane and with one step, not a run, was over the sideline and into the woods. I was about 19 at the time. No one believes me to this day.

    " I had some strange experiences in my childhood. A friend from up the street, she and I would walk through the woods. There was a path that went in a big circle where the older neighborhood kids would ride dirt bikes. It was about a mile around, I''d say. When we''d get about 2/3 the way around this ''circle'' we''d hear single short whistles and small stones would be tossed near us. We thought it was the neighborhood kids, so kind of ignored it, but this would happen every time we walked around in this section of the woods. About 3/4 the way around the circle, we saw some matted down dry grass, that looked like a bedding area. Also, some strange footprints as well in the muddy areas. They were huge footprints and the toes seemed almost rectangular in the dried footprints. We''d also smell a wet dog type smell in this area. The last time I was in that section of the woods was 1975/1976. <BR><BR>A couple other times, I''d go with a friend to the Howell/Farmingdale area. We''d walk back to an abandoned house in the woods and drink a couple beers. We''d hear noises and saw some of the same size footprints that the neighbor and I had seen in the woods behind my neighborhood. <BR><BR>Fast forward 5 years or so, a boyfriend and I were smoking cigarettes in the school field by the house I grew up in. It was Fall, just at dusk, probably 6pm-ish. I happened to look up and look across the school field and saw this HUGE shadow standing on a slightly raised hill across the school field, by another neighborhood...I stared at that figure for a minute thinking that person sure has long arms, It was probably 60 feet away from us at that time. I stared a minute more and suddenly I could see that figure crystal clear as it bolted across the school field towards us. As it got closer I could see reddish brown shaggy fur on this huge man/ape type creature. It ran towards us silently, but with huge strides, as it came closer and closer. All I could do was yell, \"RUN!\" and we ran through a neighbor''s yard and back to my house. I told my mom what happened and she said we shouldn''t have been in the school field when it was getting dark...I was petrified and the next day my boyfriend and one of his friends went back to look for this thing, but we never found it again. I recently talked to my son about this incident and wrote it out for him, as I wanted my story documented. I still to this day get goosebumps every time I talk about it. ",

    " First I want it to be clear that I am very skeptical that what I witnessed was anything out of the ordinary. I say this for reasons I will explain in a moment. Nonetheless, I am reporting this incident because even though I am skeptical, it remains possible that I did observe something extraordinary and if that is so then perhaps others did or will. So I offer this report as a possible sighting and to hopefully corroborate any other reports that you may receive involving the same area. Any such additional reports would of course then lend more credence to mine.<BR><BR>Also I would like to indicate that I firmly believe in the existence of sasquatch and have had an ardent interest in this mystery since I was around 12. My interest was reinvigorated a year or so ago when I found the BFRO website. I  grew up in the northwest portion of New Jersey, which is an area of predominately deciduous forest with sporadic coniferous areas as well. There are open pastures as well as rugged mountainous terrain there.   An example   being the Kittatinny Ridge that runs through Sussex County and contains a portion of the Appalachian Trail. So while I don''t believe this area offers the optimal environmental characteristics to sustain or attract a constant sasquatch population, I do think (as with many other species) that a transient sasquatch may very well wander into this area periodically (from areas west or north) and perhaps remain for an extended period of time. I think the reports of sightings from this area over the last 30 years or so pretty much indicate this type of pattern. <BR><BR>So ever since my renewed interest began, I have made a point of being much more observant of my surroundings especially when driving through those types of areas I mentioned above. I should also note that I am in law enforcement and I have a keen interest in most matters of science. I accept the need for a scientific approach to investigating this and other type of phenomena and that belief is what has instilled part of the skepticism of my \"sighting\". That and the fact that my incident provides minimal information from an investigatory stand point. Also, while I indicated earlier that I felt the terrain and environment of this area could offer refuge to a transient creature, the amount of development and activity, especially where my incident occurred says otherwise. But with that said, here''s what I saw.<BR><BR> On this day I was really attempting to look beyond the road edge and peer into the woods or fields as I drove past. <BR>There is a small creek (Burnt Meadow Brook)that runs perpendicular from the roadway into that area. As I looked back about 200-250 yards or so I observed what seemed to be a human like shape standing and appearing to be looking down either at the ground or into the water (I couldn''t tell from my vantage point). It was dark brown to black in color and for the short 4-5 seconds I observed it there was no apparent movement. My best guess would be that it was between six and seven feet in height. My perception was that this \"thing\" was facing opposite of my direction of travel and that I was viewing its right side. The distance was too great to observe any fine detail or to even determine if it wasn''t just an old tree trunk.  However, upon passing that location on subsequent days, it was no longer present. It''s possible that it was a person, but I am pretty confident it was not based on the appearance and the relative inaccessibility of the location. Due to the distance, I was basically looking at a silhouette and thus unable to note any specific anatomical features. <BR><BR>I questioned the probability of a sasquatch venturing into this particular area considering it was during daylight hours and the location is right off a major interstate and this occurred during the peak of the morning rush. Also, the area I described is on the south side of the highway, perhaps 300-400 yards from the edge of a large commercial/retail/residential area. I should note however, that the area on the opposite (north) side of the road is predominately woods and is basically the southern edge of Green Pond Mountain which, being sparsely inhabited and heavily wooded, could offer a person or animal the ability to travel northward and westward for miles unseen. This tract of forested, relatively undeveloped land extends continuously into Pennsylvania and New York State. So I guess my implication is that if this was an animal, it most likely approached from the north side.  I have since noticed that there is a drainage culvert (to accommodate the creek mentioned earlier) which appears to run under the highway connecting the north and south sides. I do not know the diameter of this culvert however. <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>",
    :environment
    "Approaching the location, there is a small wooded tract which ends at the edge of a marshy, wetlands area. A small creek (Burnt Meadow Brook)runs through it which consists of marsh type grass, low brush and some sporadic trees. Continuing east the area remains wetlands with a predominance of tall reeds before transitioning back to a wooded terrain. The entire marsh area is perhaps 200-250 yards wide and perhaps 1/4 mile deep before ending at the commercial area.",

    "A couple of years before I was walking to the pond at night with my friend and we stopped in the middle of the path to smoke a cigarette when we heard a thumping sound 40 feet in the woods followed by a grunting elepant type sound.The thumping sound was so intense that the ground beneath us shook. It did the sound 2 more times before we got out of there like a bat out of hell.The grunting sound was very intimidating. Also I went to the same spot where we heard the running a few weeks later and went hiking. I found some intersting piles of rocks and there were what looked like branches lined up and stacked against trees making almost like a makeshift shelter or like a crappy made tee-pee without the cloth outside.",

    " My friend and I wanted to go fishing at bear pond so we left my house at about 6 pm. We went topwater fishing because of the approaching sunset. We went in a canoe and fished along the edge of the entire pond.  It started to get too dark to cast accurately considering all of the trees along the edge overhang the water. We decided to start heading to the docking area to go home. By now it was completely dark and there are no houses in the back part of the pond just woods and rivers and some preety steep hills that go on forever.We were at a complete stop in the canoe between the mainland and an island when all of a sudden we both heard a loud scream comming from the mainland up on a hill. It sounded like a mix between a young girl screaming and a weard bird like sound.We both looked at each other and said \"What the hell was that\".Again it happened and again. Just as the sound stopped something started to RUN in the mainland woods about 50 yards from us.The sound was very loud like crashing and running. <BR><BR>Something was watching us very quietly because we had passed that area along the edge of the water about 20 minutes earlier.  Anyway, this thing was definitely on two legs running towards the screaming sound on the hill. It must have ran 100 feet in 7 seconds. I must tell you that there was a new moon that night so it was pitch black out. When the thing was running it broke sticks and branches and was very loud almost running urgently and clumsily. At that point it stopped completely by the screaming sound we heard seconds ago. My friend and I both sat there stunned in the canoe; our eyes looking toward the direction of where the running stopped. We sat there for almost an hour listening but we only heard small twigs breaking nothing else. We eventually left but we both know what it was. <BR><BR>We are both in our mid 20''s and are avid outdoorsman and know that whatever we heard was not a bear or deer.",

I saw something run across the road extremely fast.  It was around the same height as the hood of my car and it was black in color.  It ran so fast I didnt even need to hit the breaks.  Being an avid outdoors man I can usually identify animals, but I was not able to identify this one.  It was defiantly on two legs and covered in black hair.  No bear can run that fast and it defiantly wasnt a coyote or fox.  I drove home as fast as I could; I was shocked by the encounter and called my friend to tell him.

    " My brother and I camped overnight in High Point State Park, New Jersey, the other night. Driving around the park, the camping sites were labeled with numbers. We wanted to set up in a place as far away as we could from the other people. I myself, have known the existence of Sasquatch to be real for quite some time. Not from a personal experience which was yet to come, but because of watching so many people tell their stories of encounters, and just seeing the genuine fright and truthfulness in their eyes when they tell their stories. My brother however, always laughed at the subject of Bigfoot, and was a complete skeptic. So, my brother and I has set up camp on the edge of what I''m assuming was the only lake in the park. We walked through the forest in the daytime, and indeed found many peculiar structures and tree breaks I had seen before on Bigfoot TV shows. As night fell, we made a fire, and watched the numerous stars reveal themselves as the night got darker. Around 12 o''clock at night I went over to a rock right by the edge of the lake and looked up at the stars, while my brother tended the fire. I''m an astronomy fan, so before I knew it I had been sitting there for two hours when I checked my phone and it said it was nearing 2 in the morning. Just then my phone ran out of battery. While sitting on the rock, I began to feel a weird sensation that someone or something was watching me, I checked to see if it was my brother but he was staring into the fire. I dismissed this feeling and told myself I had just brought it on myself. I looked back up at the stars and got lost in some train of thought when all of the sudden, something made a very loud noise that could only be described as a very large man exhaling aggressively towards me. I jumped up and ran to my brother, and we heard the thing walk towards the forest, all the while breaking branches and continuing to make the same aggressive noise I heard so close to me. It got quiet, and my brother and I were standing looking in the direction where all the noise had came from when it made the noise again. Now, I don''t speak Sasquatch but that thing was telling us to get the heck out of there. I don''t get scared easily at all, and I was shaking like I never had before. I felt so much negative energy and decided I was too scared to stay outside, so we went to the car and sat inside, praying whatever made that noise didn''t come back. My brother described the sound as sounding like someone ripping a tent. Whatever the noise was, absolutely no common animal could have made it. After a sleepless night, when it got light out again around 5:30, we built up the courage to go back where we heard the noise to see if there were any indications of what made it. And when we got there, I was shocked. There was a makeshift bed made from giant leaves that was fit for a very large creature. I could see the exact spot where the thing that had made the noise was watching me, and where it walked away, as there was a clear path of flattened grass and plants leading up the forest. The area was wet and muddy, and indeed there were footprints. But, as I was taking pictures the path leading from the bed to the upper forest, it happened again. The thing made the same exact noise, this time it was so close, I nearly fell. We ran back to our campsite and listened. But nothing made a sound. We stayed there for about 30 minutes until I decided to go back and see if there were fresh prints or anything I could take back as proof. I took more pictures, and i was standing on the trail leading back to our campsite looking at the pictures I had taken when again, the thing made the same noise! This time it was on the side of me that I would have to run past it to get back to the campsite. As soon as I heard it, it felt like my heart literally dropped and my legs became wobbly, but I summed up my courage and once again ran back to the campsite in fear. It was only about 10 seconds away, and when I got there my brother was standing there wide eyed asking if I had heard the noise. Whatever it was, it was not happy and we heard it walk up into the forest breaking branches and exhaling aggressively as it headed deeper into the forest. At this point my brother wanted to get the heck out of there, but I needed to see it. I went up to the road right before the forest where we had heard it go in, and looked around, but saw nothing. I was so confused on how the heck it ever got so close to me without me seeing or hearing it walk at all. While I was walking on the road, I saw my brother walk up from the campsite looking around. When he spotted me, he sighed in relief and told me he though I was getting attacked because he heard a bunch of human like screams coming from the forest. I walked towards where he was and started to hear them too, but by the time I reached him the screams started to sound like some kind of weird chatter. My brother, the skeptic, was so scared he told me were packing up and leaving right away. I have no doubt in my mind that we just happened to pick a campsite right next to where a Sasquatch was sleeping, and he was just not happy about that. I know what we heard was a Sasquatch. My brother entered a skeptic, but left a full believer in Bigfoot. ",

    " My family and I pulled into a huge turn around at Stokes State Forest off of Layton Road. We stepped out of the jeep as we had to tinkle. When I got back in my car, I noticed someone standing behind the very high brush, 7-8 feet tall at least because I could see its complete head over the bushes. It just stood there watching us. Reddish-brown, orangutan colored hair, covered it''s head. It was very human-like and I could tell that it was standing upright. I blinked a million times to try and really focus as much as I could, paying attention to detail. I couldn''t make out the face for certain as it was covered in hair. When we started to drive, it immediately took off in the opposite direction as to not confront us. It seemed to be frightened. At this point I said out loud, WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT? Before I could describe what I had seen, my 14 year old son beat me to it. He said mom you mean that reddish brown haired creature behind those bushes?! I couldn''t believe it!! I was so glad I wasn''t the only one who had seen this thing because it''s definitely a shock to the eyes. ",

    "Usual turn around areas are gravel covered or meadow-like but this one had two separate dirt roads and it was pretty steep on the way up.",

    " Hiking the Seven Sisters Trail from Mt Holyoke to the Notch in the Hadley / Amherst area of Massachusetts. My hiking partner and I got to Taylor''s Notch and could hear the wind ripping through making eerie noises. We both heard a lot of whistling  and breaking branches which I initially attributed to the wind going through the rocky ledges of Taylor''s Notch. We hiked over one large hill and the wind was lessening but we realized the whistling was closer and then there were whooping noises and calls along with the whistles. The calls were going back and forth and I realized we were surrounded. We kept talking loudly hoping to scare off any animals and kept my bear spray in hand for the next mile or so. Not sure what it was but highly unusual and did not sound like a grown or baby bear,canine, coyote, mountain lion, or fox. I frequently hike and spend time outdoors. I am at a loss as to what was with us that day. I am going back soon to see if I can find more.",

    " Hello!<BR><BR>This is something that happened a long time ago and to be honest I never thought it could be connected to Sasquatch/Bigfoot but recently Ive been reading about the topic a lot and I figured Id send it to you guys after finding your site and just checking out reports from areas where Ive lived in the past. Anyway, I found a report from Belchertown, MA and I lived a rural part of Belchertown for several years when I was in college. <BR><BR>This was sometime around 1997-1998 in Belchertown. My housemates and I were out on our porch which faced a 2-3 acre meadow. This open meadow and the porch were on the east side of the house. The entire area past the meadow to the East was wooded with houses and cabins here and there for about a mile until you hit a lake. Behind the house was abput 10-20 yards of woods with a walking trail and then another 10 yards past was a train tracks running East/west then more woods. <BR><BR>Anyway, my housemates and I were out on the porch when we heard the sound of a tree crashing to the ground.  About 19 seconds later while we all were kindve shocked there was an enormously loud and guttural growl/scream/roar.  In all my life I have never heard any animal sound that could match it in intensity, volume, and it just sounded plain angry and vivacious. It is hard to describe just how loud it was and how stunned we all were that this was coming from an animal just inside the tree line.  There were coyotes, owls, foxes galore back there and the sounds they made were a world away in comparison.  <BR><BR>We all immediately looked at each other, got up and went into the house as fast as we could without saying a word. <BR><BR>Everyone assumed it was an animal but after reading about and hearing recordings of presumed Sasquatch scream and howls it brought the memory rushing back because it is so similar to what we heard. <BR><BR>Anyway, just wanted to send this in as I saw there was another report for this area. <BR><BR>Best regards ",
    :environment
    "The property was about 7 acres. Most of it a meadow but wooded in front of the street with a small creek near the road. Woods surrounded the entire property and behind the house there was a public trail and a train track running parallel East/west behind the house. To the east of the 2-3 acre was a wooded area filled with many large Birch trees. The houses in this area are mostly in the woods.",

    " I parked up the road a ways so any cops or ranger patrols didn''t see my car. It was 1am with a 3/4 moon. The water was very low this day. I was fishing and there was about 4 Beaver-Tail slaps on the water so I knew there would''nt be any smallies hanging around. I took a few more casts and caught a Dace. Its like a sucker with the body of a trout. Very silver in color and unedible. I was trying to get the fish off my hooks when I heard something heavy about 45 yrds away from me cracking sticks as it approached from the road onto the freshly cut brush (from the work they did around there, days prior).<BR><BR>It sounded like a human walking, and I thought I was in trouble with the law. My flashlight was dying and I was having trouble seeing just getting the fish off my 2 treble hooks. <BR><BR>I asked, \"Who''s There?!?!\" and I just heard a stick snap really loud as it stood still. I hit my flashlight in order to make it brighter and I seen big eyeshine and a dark sillouette of what looked to be shoulders. I started yelling at it to get out of here and at this point, I''m thinking deer... or worse, maybe a bear standing up. I heard a few more big snaps as it walked onto the paved road and that''s when it cried out in this terrible noise that I''ve never heard before. It echoed thru the mountains and it scared the bajesus out of me.<BR>It wasn''t a bear, or a deer, that''s for sure. It was huge, and the sound it made sounded like a shrieking demon baby. That''s the only way I could describe it. A loud shrieking howl. It wasn''t a roar or a deep growl. It was more high pitched.<BR><BR>I cut my line with the lure still in the fishes mouth and kicked the fish half hazardly into the water and ran as fast as I could to my car which was the scariest run/walk/stop & listen journey to my car I''ve ever encountered in my life.

I''ve worked as a wilderness counselor for the past 10 years and heard all sorts of animal noises in the night foxes, coyotes, owls etc.. This sound had a lack of clarity but power in its voice. I knew that it came from a long distance away. I remember listening to Bigfoot calls years back and on a hunch ran inside found the EXACT same howls on the net sounded like the Snohomish, WA 1978-79 calls. I woke up my friend who has been hunting western mass for 30 years and he said he never heard anything like it. He heard it and he said it gave him the chills. The howls trailed off as if he creature was moving. Incident lasted for about 10 minutes. I google mapped the area the sound came from and its a huge swath of wilderness that stretches into Vermont and south into Connecticut. ",

    " First of all, I feel the need to preface this report with some background information. I have been in the process of writing a book on Ape Cave near Mt St Helens. I contacted Jeff Lemley about getting some reports about Bigfoot stories to add to my book. I have kept in close contact with Jeff since the first contact and emailed him immediately after we got back from our trip.<BR><BR>I told my husband, Larry, that I wanted to go camping at Peterson Prairie for my birthday (August 15th) with my twin sister, Vicki and her husband, Jim K. I thought it would be fun to take in a cave or two, time permitting. My husband and I are avid cavers and enjoy spending free time exploring the wild caves of Southern Washington State near Mt St Helens and Mt Adams. We both felt it would be a good time to introduce my sister and her husband (and their toy red Poodle, Sparky) to the sport of wild caving.<BR><BR>The four of us drove our two minivans through the Dark Divide and arrived at camp late in the day on the 14th. Our favorite camp spot was still available so we proceeded to set up camp. As it turned out, my sister and her husband, took the safe way out and set up camp in their Dodge Caravan, while I pitched our miniscule backpacking tent 50 feet South of the camp in a small clearing surrounding by small pines. It was just enough room to pitch a small tent and still be able to tie off the guy ropes to keep the rainfly away from the tent.<BR><BR>As far as I knew, the night was uneventful until my husband spoke up the next morning. Larry told all of us that he thought he heard a Bigfoot howling (my husband is an extreme skeptic when it comes to anything related to Bigfoot). We all talked about it for a while and then decided to get ready to go caving in Cheese Cave, a local lava tube. Later in the day, we rode our bikes to some local caves and then went back to camp. Later, Larry and I left my sister and her husband at camp to rest while we set out to find Dynamite Cave. We drove around all of the dirt roads in the STR that we thought it was supposed to be located in. We parked the van at several locations. At one spot, my husband started walking down a remote trail with me following a short distance behind him. I stopped on the trail not far from the car because I heard something very large run through the bush to my right, just off the trail. My husband kept going, but I was too apprehensive to move. Whatever it was, it was huge; but it didn''t sound like an elk moving through the bush. Also, I felt like something was watching me. It was quite creepy! Since Larry had moved out of sight, I felt very vunerable and literally ran up to catch up with him. I kept telling him I wanted to go back to the car; but didn''t want to go by the one spot alone. He finally relented and we walking briskly to the car.<BR><BR>That night we all walked to the clearing due East of camp, next to the road which led to the group camp to watch the stars and anything else interesting in the clear skies. After turning in about 10PM, we slept soundly until about 3AM, when I was awakened by an incredibly loud howling, unlike anything I had ever heard in my life. Since I am an avid outdoorsperson, I have camped out and seen and heard most of the wild things that occur in the forests and mountains. This was like nothing I had ever heard before. There was absolutely no other sounds from the forest until a Barred Owl responded to the howl. <BR><BR>I woke Larry up to ask him about the howls. He said that it was the very same thing that he heard the night before. We both listened to it banter back and forth with the owl. After maybe 10 to 15 minutes of howling, the owl took off flying North through the trees. We could both hear his wings flapping as he was hooting. He was much closer to us than the thing which was howling; but the howling was much louder than the owl. <BR><BR>What happened next sent chills down my spine. I was laying on my stomach in the tent, needing very much to go outside and relieve myself; but unwilling to venture outside due to the howlings I was still listening to. Larry had fallen back asleep, so unfortunately, the thing I heard next fell on my ears alone. The best I could describe it was a howling turning into an Ape-like chattering. It sounded like someone was practicing phonics by contorting their mouth, while at the same time, reciting all the vowels. That is the best I can describe it. The sounds were incredibly loud and quite frightening sounding. I lay motionless until the sounds died down and I fell asleep.<BR><BR>I was awakened one more time around 6:15 to 6:30 in the morning. Light was already finding its way into camp which I could see through the mosquito netting at the head of our tent. This time I heard a pack of coyotes start up, followed again by that same howling sound. At this point, I was really getting freaked out; but was still not willing to venture out of the tent. As soon as it was light enough, I got up and ran to my sister''s van. I rapped on their window and asked if they heard the howls. Of course, they hadn''t heard anything; but were quite interested in what Larry and I had heard that night.<BR><BR>When I got home, I emailed Jeff Lemley to see if he had any wave files to listen to that might sound like what we heard. I listened to every owl sound on the web and nothing sounded like what we heard. A few days later, I got an email from Jeff about the other report four days before ours, only 6 miles North of us. As I told Jeff, both my husband and I would like to think that the sounds we heard were in fact, Barred Owls. Anyone sleeping in a flimsy nylon tent would probably convince themselves of the same. But then again...",

    " I am reporting this incident from 1991 because I heard of your group on the radio on the way home from work tonight, and you sound credible.<BR><BR>I served as a US Army Infantry Sergeant at Ft.Lewis Wa. for several years, I am also an alpine climber. I went to Mt Adams most of the time because it was much more private than other mountains ie: St Helens, Rainer -- to many people. I also loved the thousands of acres of wilderness area which was restricted to six or eight hearts per group and no vehicles.<BR><BR>Another Sergeant named Jim Avila, my climbing partner, and good friend, and his Golden Retriever pup were there also.<BR><BR>We were only camping and hiking around this trip, since we had the puppy with us, normally we would have camped on a snowfield above the tree line.<BR><BR>Just after nightfall we were talking and the puppy was next to the fire. The sky was crystal clear and everything \"felt\" normal. Since I spent six months out of the year living in the woods, and deserts of the western US and Europe, in the Army, the night is my ally--- I am an expert at what normal feels like.<BR><BR>I needed to urinate, so I stood up and walked to my right rear about 20 feet where a path led down to a stream, I could hear and see the slow moving shallow water in this shallow pea gravel bedded creek, I did my thing and returned to the fire.<BR><BR>We then decided to have some fun and see if we could get a coyote to howl, although we were not sure if any may have been around. We started our best howls to no avail. We continued for about five min. and then stopped. About and hour passed since my previous trip to urinate and I figured I would go again before getting in the sleeping bag.<BR><BR>Jim was across from the fire and could see my walking toward the spot overlooking the path to the creek where I intended to void my bladder, HA HA. <BR><BR>As my feet stopped I could hear footsteps in the dry gravel on the other side of the creek bed about 20'' away. When It heard me stop, it stopped a little to late and I heard it. I felt intelligence in it''s movement, not instinct, it knew it had been busted and just froze. I froze and drew my pistol Jim saw this and at the same time said the puppy flew into the cab of the truck. <BR><BR>Jim, also sensing something wrong, drew his pistol, and stood up. I was looking right where this guy was standing but could not see him because he was across the water but still in front of the opposite bank, he was still frozen like a ROCK. Jim came to back me up he did not know what in the hell was going on and instead of telling him to stop I just kept my eyes glued to the spot I knew the guy was at and he finally decided to move out.He took two strides up the bank away from me with a look over his right shoulder as he was moving away to the right.<BR><BR>His look was concern mixed with a child like fear, as if he really wanted to introduce himself in some way to our \"wolf-calling group\", Also puzzled like \"why are you indiots calling coyotes?----Your Humans, Stupid!\". The most animal like trait was a sort of a very brief mock anger face, which looked like an after-thought just before the big guy went into the woods. <BR><BR>I looked at Jim --- no words --- we threw most of our stuff in the truck and left in a big hurry. There was no way I was staying in those woods that night.<BR><BR>The big guy was huge, but slender as I recall. Don''t ask me how, but I know he was an adolesent. He was sort of like a big kid, but moved like the wind. He saw my eyes and I saw his. I did not tell Jim what I saw, I never did. I never had to.<BR><BR>Please belive me, I swear this account to be true.<BR>Thank You, and God''s Speed in your search.<BR>",

    " My wife and I started to make our descent from the summit of Mount Greylock during a morning hike.  Approximately half a mile on the Cheshire Harbor Trail, close to Rockwell Rd, my wife and I heard a clapping sound.  We stood in place for a few moments, listening to the sound.  The \"clapping\" was non-rhythmic, sometimes there was one or two, other times there were many \"claps\".  In between the \"claps\" there was sounds of something walking, breaking fallen branches as it moved.  The sounds were about a distance of 100 feet from our position on the trail, within a thicker patch of woods.  We listened for almost a full minute and then decided to continue on the trail, moving closer to the source of the sound.  When we reached the area where we believed the clapping sound to be coming from we listened again and heard nothing and had seen no movement.  Further down the trail I attempted figure out the sound.  I did some tree knocking and banged rocks together, but only when I clapped my hands did it most closely match the sound my wife and I had heard.  It was a sound that I have never heard before and it has sparked my interest into figuring out what animal made this noise.",

    " Approx. summer of 2000, I was on Negus Mountain in Rowe, MA (Franklin County) with my wife, sitting on the tailgate...we heard something in the woods, about 100 yards away, walking towards us.  As it got closer, it started to walk faster.  As a life long hunter, I at first told her not to worry, it''s a squirrel or something.  As this creature got closer, my ears and experience told me that this was a biped, only 2 feet crunching through the leaves.  My wife was so freaked out that we had to leave immediately before I could investigate more.<BR><BR>Fast Forward to 2006, I was driving to work one night for the 2300 job in East Deerfield, MA.  I remember I was running a little late, so I was probably speeding, and the time would have been 2230ish.  It was raining lightly.  In West Charlemont, at the end of so-called Tea Street Extension, there is a bridge that carries the road over the railroad tracks. This is about 2-3 miles (the way the bird flies) from the encounter above.  What I saw was something standing perfectly still behind the guardrail.  It was about 6, maybe 6 and a half feet tall, had long brown hair all over it''s body, and was stock still.  I drive this route almost daily (or nightly, in my case) for over 12 years, I know what belongs and what doesn''t.  This did not belong.  I turned around and went back, and it was gone.  Being late for work, I turned around again and went to work.  I have never had any doubt that I saw a Sasquatch.  I haven''t reported it because I don''t want people to think I am a crackpot.  I just recently told my father about it, who told me to look into any organizations such as yours.",

    " A friend and I had been on Black creek in Clay county for a few hours bass fishing with absolutely no luck.  Working the last stretch of bank before we called it a day when I heard something walking in the woods.  I could hear large footsteps and something that sounded like it was scooping water or slapping water, I really can''t describe the sound.  <BR><BR>Now I know this particular area and the wildlife that inhabits it pretty well I think, It is full of deer, wild boar, turkeys, a few black bears, and the rest of the small woodland critters.  And this sound was way too large to be any of them.  <BR><BR>Back to my story, after we heard the noise I motioned to my friend to be silent so I could trolling motor over to the bank so I could try to get a look.  As we were silently getting closer it seemed like the creature must have noticed us because we stuck out like a sore thumb against the back drop of the creek, while it stayed perfectly camoflauged in the wood.  We sat there for a few moments hoping it would move and reveal itself to us which it never did.  <BR><BR>So, as the sun was dropping we had to get back to the boat ramp, we quitely circled away from the shore.  Just as we got away from the tree line something landed in the water about 50 or so feet from the boat. It was a loud splash like a rock or heavy object was thrown because it hit about 15 feet from shore.  Both startled we put out life jackets on and got ready to leave when we heard the footstep start back up, and they sounded as if they were running away at a brisk pace and it sounded like it was a long stride. <BR><BR>Jokingly we said we had just encountered a sasquatch just like every other time I heard something unusual on that body of water.  But as we made our way back to the dock I noticed we were within half a mile from powerlines.  And were within a mile of the county dump that I know for a fact is a popular spot with the local whitetail deer population.  ",

    " I''d like to make a report, however it was years ago but I remember every part pretty well.<BR><BR>I told a few folks about this over the years and they think I was nuts. But doesn''t matter what they think. I was close enough to know what it was. I would say about less than 50 ft. Right in the middle of a fire road.<BR><BR>In December 1977, my dad, uncle and my dad''s other friends and myself went up to the cabin owned by a hunters club in Gardner, Mass. We went to spend the night, cook food and my dad and his friends like to play cards after eating supper. Myself and a friend used the snowmobile with a sled attached to the back, we took turns driving the ski doo around and the other would stand on the foot rest on the sled.<BR><BR>The area was in northern central Massachusetts, very close to New Hampshire boarder. The cabin is in Ashburnham Mass. It''s about 2.5 miles up a fire road called Old Colony Road. I remember it was a snowy winter that year. The area where we saw this thing was right on the edge of a swamp, old train tracks run right thru the area and crosses the fire road that we used to get to the cabin.<BR><BR>It was about 4 p.m. or so, it was just getting a little dark. My friend and I left the cabin with the snowmobile, he was driving first and I was on the foot rest on the sled. We left and came up to the swamp, crossed over the tracks and headed down the road about 50 ft or so. It was getting a little late and we decided to not go to far so we turned the sled around on the road. Had to pick it up because of the narrowness of the road. Once we turned it around it was my turn to drive. So now were facing the tracks and the swamp is on both sides of the road. the road goes right thru the swamp and the tracks cross right by the edge of the swamp.<BR><BR>At this point I looked behind me to see if my friend was on the sled and holding on, when I looked up I saw this creature walking on 2 legs like a human. He crossed right by the tracks at the edge of the swamp and crossed the road right in front of us. I remember it looking at us and I remember the arms swing clearly. Just like the pictures I have seen from your site. Very similar. Anyway, I remember the its size, that''s what was scarey, so large, I''d say about 7to 9 ft high, weight about 400 to 500 pounds. At least for something that size it would most likely be heavy. I know the woods there well. I''ve spent years in the military and hunt every year. I have been trained in tracking and survival in the woods so I know what I am saying and what I saw. But the thing took about 2 steps and he was across the road. All black hair, didn''t notice any smells, but I can tell you this. I won''t forget that day ever. It was cold anyway and with no breeze the smell of it wouldn''t travel far. My friend was shocked. He won''t even mention it when I see him these days. He told one person and they treated him like he was on drugs. So thats why I never wanted to tell to many people.<BR><BR>I wanted to say something about it now because I just say a program on TV the other night about bigfoot and the Kiamichi Mountians, I think in Oklahoma or somewhere out there.<BR><BR>I remember one other thing that might be relevant. That being noises I have been hearing over the years in the woods there. Something like a crying sound but so load it almost seemed as if it were close by. I think it was a ways away because when we heard the sounds it was late, about midnight. We sit by the fireplace outside the cabin sometimes late cooking steak or deer meat on the grill. Behind the cabin is a huge swamp area that goes up to Route 12 in Ashburnham, Mass. The swamp is down a bit behind the cabin. We find moose droppings back there and lots of tree scraps from deer.<BR><BR>I beleive there passing thru that area at times. Those sounds I heard were never heard there before and I don''t hear them now when I go up there. Every now and then they seem to come back, but only when were outside sitting by the fire. Strange indeed. These woods go far as well and you could easily travel them and end up in New Hampshire or further without seeing a house.<BR><BR>As time goes by and the more I read about what other folks saw and the similarities between each story I''m more wanting to do some of my own investigating, but its very scary out there at night, especially for me. I carry a loaded .44 when I''m up there just because I have seen this thing up close enough to know what it was. No doubt in my mind. ",

    " I am 45 years old, have spent my whole life in the woods. I have been hunting and fishing since I was very young. On June 28th my wife and I decieded to take a walk in the woods. We were heading to a secluded resivior located aprox. 2 miles in the woods. We came upon a spot in the woods that seemed liked someone was watching us. We heard a noise come from some bushes. I thought it was a grunt from a buck. We both expected to a deer come outof the brush. I said, maybe it was a Bigfoot. She told me to shut up and keep walking. We walked for another 15 minutes and realized we were on the wrong path to the lake. We stopped, ate lunch and headed back into the woods. We had stopped at some power lines and sat in some shade. It was over 94 gegrees that day, and this was about noon time.<BR>As we walked back, we both noticed some very DEEP foot prints that did not look right. They were clearly 5 toed \"Human\" prints. In between the prints, was some deer tracks. The tracks clearly looked like the Human prints were chasing the deer prints. We both looked at each other and said, why would someone be running Barefoot, in 100 degree weather in the middle of the woods on a Tuesady afternoon? There were no other people in the woods at that time. The tracks were not there the first time we passed this spot, the noise was, the tracks were not. At this point I became very concerned that what ever made the prints was still in the area. I grabbed a big rock and told my wife to take some pictures with her cell phone. The tracks were about 6 to 7 feet apart. I could tell the first print was a right foot, that jumped out of the woods. The sixth and final step was a left foot that looked like it pushed off into the woods. No other tracks were before or after these six prints. We both became very nervous and started talking loudly and whistling. I did not want to run into this \"person\". We became a little confused and ended up on the worng path home. We walked for a couple hours, no way were we going back the way we came.<BR><BR><BR>Did not notice any smells or sounds. Just very quiet. No animal sound at all.",

    " Me and my wife picked my mother up from work in Lima, OH at 2 AM. We were traveling down 117S/E and turned left on Philips rd. We were on our way home and drove across the second bridge when a dark shape on the south side of the road caught my attention, and apparently my wife and mother also. I had not said anything until they said they saw something, my suspicions were now confirmed. I stopped the car and backed up. Whatever it was appeared to have been laying in the ditch that goes under the bridge and when I backed the car up it appeared to get up and lean over as if shielding itself and seemed as if it realized we could see it. The creature stood up and rushed at our car. It seemed that it covered about 30 feet effortlessly, it was very fast I think we were all shocked. I floored the car without thinking. I asked them if it was still behind us. They said it had come out into the road behind us. I got the feeling that it had wanted to scare us off. I questioned my wife and mother about what they had seen. We all saw the same thing. I just seen the immense size of it and it looked like it had very coarse looking hair. My mother and wife said it had a very large belly and was of a very thick build. My wife said it had a round head and no neck.",

    " I was driving northbound on route 146. I was driving with my sister (the only other person in the car) and she was looking down at her I-Pod and was in the front passenger seat. The traffic was average not too many cars but a few, and I was doing about 65-68 mph.  I looked about 3/4 of a mile ahead and saw something off to the rightside of the highway not on the highway but near the woodline on the grass. At first it looked like someone possibly in a gilley suit but then as I got closer I couldn''t believe my eyes because it looked just like what you hear about and see artist renderings of a bigfoot like creature. It was too tall to be a person in a suit approx. 7-8ft tall and very broad with black hair. I couldn''t see any specific facial features or chest features as it turned into the woods when i was about 1/8 of a mile away. It was walking parralell to the woodline then took a 90 degree turn into the woods. When I saw this I immediately slowed down to about 50mph and looked intently into the woodline by this time I was able to get my sisters attention (she was listening to music on the I-Pod looking down) we both stared into the woods and Icouldn''t see anything but see thinks she saw something black moving in the woods. I still can''t believe what I saw, there was no cars parked on the left or right shoulders of the highway. The creature did not appear to be running the entire sighting lasted for 7-8 seconds. I am very sure of what I saw it was a dark haired looked very much like a bear walking on two legs.",

    " On this day, myself, a friend, Eddy and 2 girls, felt like taking a ride. Before I begin I just want it noted that there was NO drinking or the use of drugs. We decided to go to Plum Island. At the time, the refuge was free to enter and the entire road was dirt. That day there was no one in the refuge, as we drove down the road,  I noticed no cars the entire 6.3 miles of the refuge, it was empty, we drove to the end.  At the last small area to park, I pulled in, across the road was a narrow boardwalk that lead to a 50 foot observation tower. We all went up. We hung around up there for about a half hour, I started hearing noises, first I heard clicking, loud clicking, then short high pitched screams, it sounded maybe 100 yards away. I took a look around, but didnt see anything.  I noticed there was no one in the area.  I saw no birds or waterfowl.  The sounds went on for about 10 minutes or so, I felt uneasy at this point and said we should go. We all got in my car and started back out. I was only driving for a couple of minutes and I saw a very large dark figure cross the road from the marsh/brush area on the left to the right, which had heavy brush and that lead to the beach.  I immediately looked at Eddy and asked did you see that?  He answered Yes! We asked each other what it was. The girls in the back seat didnt see anything s they were to busy talking to each other. I slowed to almost a stop where what we saw it cross the road, there was solid brush that it went into, we could see where something went through the brush. There was no sign of  it, it was gone. The figure that crossed was huge, 7 feet or more, very wide, all black from head to toe. It was a little hunched forward as it walked upright. I noticed its arms were longer than average and they swung as it walked.  It took only three steps to cross the road. The road is about three cars wide. It had a smooth stride. It did not look in my direction,  just crossed the road and it was gone. I only saw it for about 5 seconds I could never forget the image of it crossing the road. <BR>I went back there today, my children wanted to see where I had the sighting.  I didnt make back up the observation tower because of these flies that nest in the marsh, they are Green Headed Flies, they are, as the woman in the office said, man eaters.  They bite hard. As you drive down the road, they follow the car, dozens fly around the car. So the kids didnt want to get out and get eaten by them and neither did I, so I didnt get up on the observation tower to take a look. I have told a few people what I saw and they think Im nuts.  My father looks at me strange because he knows I dont make up stories like this, I dont lie, so he just looks at me when I talk about it to him. I know what I saw, and I saw what I saw.",

    " Hi, my name is xxxxxx, I grew up in Rowley, MA.. a small old farming town established in 1639.. when I was 10, I''m now 27, my friend an I were attempting to find a way through the woods from his home street to a plaza containing a dunkin donuts for the fun of it. like I said, I grew up in the woods and this is only a distance of about a half of a mile. We started out heading in the direction we thought was good and after a while we heard a noise in the distance.. at this point we were pretty deep into just new England forest when we heard something. in the distance.. (far enough to be a hard definite sighting but close enough to be odd as hell to this day) so we looked obviously and in the middle of the woods.. randomly.. were three.. THREE, tanned brown.. (not brown black, or brown brown, but brown tan) upright creatures, running through the woods together. AS IF THEY WERE TRAVELING!!!! they were close and tight and jogging along on the hill we were on about 400 yards away.. we just watched speechless and then decided it was time to give up on finding our way and head back. I don''t know if he told anyone ever, but we lost touch over the years, but that sighting will forever connect us.. I just thought anyone who follows bigfoot should know about this.. these 3 creatures were tanned and brown, upright, jogging in a line, and fully unclothed.. I''ve seen one other unexplained sighting, but this one was absolutely dumbfounded.. I don''t know if anyone has ever seen multiple bigfoots traveling together but I have. ",

    " My dog was bothering me to go out ealry morning around 3 AM on November 25th 2000. It was very brisk out and I believe the weather was clear. Not sure about the lighting. As I was walking her, I could hear coyotes howling for a good few minutes from a distance and didn''t think much of it. Then a few minutes later after it had stopped, I was about to walk inside and heard this loud wailing coming from the woods. It literally sent a chill down my spine. It definitely was not human and not anything else I would recognize. We don''t have much wildlife bigger than deer and coyote. This went on till about 5:30 AM and kept me up. The wailing to me almost sounded depressing like it was upset or something. I told my friend''s father a few weeks later and he told me that he was out walking his dog a few years earlier and said that he clearly saw something in the woods watching him. He never told anyone because he thought no one would be lieve him. This happened across the major road by the resevoir early evening. ",

    "    It was a mild day and I decided to take a walk in the woods. After traveling about 5 or 10 minutes down a woods road I heard 3 deliberate and distinct knocks which emanated about 50 yards away from inside the brush off to my left, it stopped me dead in my tracks. I have read many of the incidents on BFRO and I could not believe what I was hearing. I composed my self and found what I considered a sturdy stick and struck a large pine tree close by in the same manner as I had just heard. It took about 5 seconds and a reply came back but only 2 deliberate knocks this time. A couple of seconds later  another sound came from a direction parallel  to the first but about 50 yards apart. This sound was like a tree being struck but with the stick breaking on impact. When the stick broke it sounded like it had a girth of a couple of inches. I struck my tree 3 more times but nothing more happened. Let me add that as I was strolling down this trail I was smoking a cigar and the wind was blowing into the direction that the knocks came from.  I continued down the trail which takes you to the edge of a pond. While exploring there I found an interesting thing. Lying on the ground was what looked like a 3 foot wooden club with a jagged end where the roots would be, it looked like something that you would see in a cave man picture. There were also 2 holes in the ground one next to a tree, the hole about 12 inches in diameter and close to 20 inches deep the other about 5 feet away from the tree 3 or 4 inches in diameter and only 4 or 5 inches deep with the club laying on its side and the small end partially in that hole. I believe that this club dug both holes because of the way the end was all rounded and imbedded with dirt. But I do not understand why.<BR>      I decided to go back the next day for photographs and I brought a yard stick with me to get these measurements. When returning  the next day I discovered a good size pile of feces on the trail about 15 feet away from the tree I had knocked on. Nothing unusual took place this day but I did take a few pictures of various other things as well which may or may not be relevant. What or who  made those knocks I will probably never know but be clear on this they were distinct, clear, timed and deliberate, of this I am sure.          <BR>",

    "I do recall now after reading some accounts - about a \"path\" deep in the woods about a mile long that ran parallel to the houses. It was about 500 feet back of my house along an old stone wall. It was covered ( canopy of trees) and very dark-even on bright days. I would occasionally walk through the woods and found this path. The entrance was through the woods 1/4 mile down the street and through a dense pine grove - you would then enter an open field and then enter this dark section of woods. I found an irregular path that rambled - but always wondered why there were many broken branches and samll trees and closed in areas(like small trees pulled together) and the rocks in the wall would be all over the place - some of them were good size. I always thought that maybe some kids used this path to school or built forts or something but I now realize it was too dense and not really in the right direction to the schools. I never heard any kids out back in all the years I have been here (almost 30 years)",

    " Twenty Five years ago (1979) I heard the most awful and terrifying screams for 3 nights in a row. We had just built a two story addition which is situated further back on a lot (about 150 feet) into the woods from the street. This area was considered suburban but was fairly rural at that time. There are houses built along the street that are on lots of 3/4 to 1 acre. We own several acres of heavily wooded land and our house sits back on the lot further than the others. The section of woods is borderd by 3 state highways and was about 1 mile (length) by 1 1/2 miles (width)of woods and some farmland fields. At the time there were only two dead end streets that penetrated this section of woods. Another country road separates this section on the west with a State park nearby (1/2 mile from the road). This park is several hundred acres of lakes and heavily wooded areas. The area now is filled with housing and development.<BR><BR>It was July and was very hot (90 degrees +) and the peepers were very loud. Each evening between 2:00 and 3:30 a.m. an extremely loud howling, screaming sound would start far away. As it came closer ( the screams lasted for 20-30 seconds each and occurred every 1-2 minutes or so) you could hear bushes and branches being swept out of the way with loud crunching and breaking sounds and screams that would get louder in intensity. The woods at that time were covered with thick vines and brambles that were about 3-5 feet high. It was extremely difficult to walk through any section of the woods that was not cleared. You just didn''t stroll through the woods, especially in the pitch black. When this \"thing\" came closer all the peepers and the night sounds completely ceased. The sound was so loud in volume that it actually caused you to \"freeze\" - I mean that it ran your blood cold!  I remember laying in bed not wanting to investigate because whatever it was - it was BIG and I did not want to find out what it was! It was not the sound of a bear, a mountain lion or a wounded deer.The sound had a human quality about it and was like - it was searching for something and had a sense of pain or distress abut it. It would travel parallel through the woods about 100 feet behind my house. On the third night I got up immediately and waited for this thing to get closer. I have a switch in the bedroom that would turn on some roof mounted flood lights that would shine in the back yard. We did not have a deck or anything at the time and the woods were about 25 feet behind the house. This thing was crashing through the woods and when it was right behind the house it gave out this huge loud moan. I was looking out the window with all the inside lights out and then I turned on the floodlights. The scream stopped and there was silence for about 5 seconds and then it crashed through the woods away from the house very quickly opposite the direction it came from. You could hear the crashing of a two footed creature. I heard the crashing sounds for about another minute and then it faded and was quiet. I was really spooked and went downstairs and started turning on all the lights and the outside lights. I noticed that all my neighbors were turning on their outside lights as well. This was unusual because no one left outside lights on and there were no street lights in this section of the street.There were at least 4 other houses that turned their lights on. I contemplated whether to call the police but did not. The next day while mowing the lawn, my elderly neighbor across the street from me came over and said \"Dave, did you hear those sounds last night? I have heard them for several nights and almost called the cops - if I hear it again I am calling the police - I never heard anything like that in my life.\" I agreed and it was good that someone else confirmed the incident to me. All these years I have only told close friends of this story and the kidding I take is unmerciful- but I know to this day what I heard was absolutely real. I forgot about it for many years until I saw some \"bigfoot\" documentary in the early 1990''s. They played a recording and when I heard it- it brought back the whole incident. It was almost identical to the sound! I have played the sound recordings on various websights and would say that it was pretty close to the Ohio or Pennsylvania recordings. I never heard anything after 1979 and I did not see anything. Perhaps others have given reports from this area and this report may be helpful. I am being truthful about this - I do not drink or do any nonprescription drugs - I am a church administrator in a Bible (nondenominational) church.  ",

    " I''ve told very few people this story for fear that they might think I''m crazy. The only reason why I''m taking the time to report this is because of a recent entry a friend of mine who knew my story told me about.<BR><BR>My story takes place in Charlestown, Rhode Island in the late 1970''s. My mother and father and I lived in a wooded area abutting the \"Indian Cedar Swamp\" and property owned by United Nuclear which probably comprises several thousand acres. The property surrounding our home was mixed  white Atlantic juniper swamp,scarlet, red and white oaks with old growth white pine stands mixed in, with a dense understory of briars, mountain laurel and blue berry brush.<BR><BR>We lived off a road with 3 houses on it. The houses were all built close to the entrance of this development. The road was part of a series of roads that were put in as the start of a development. The roads were oiled gravel and had been left to grow in after years of little or no use. It looked like the developer had started and went belly-up.<BR><BR>These roads were great to ride bikes on or take a evening cruise on after bringing my father dinner at his second job. My mother drove a baby blue Mustang Mach 1 and she would drive around the roads with me looking at deer before we retired to our home for the evening. As a kid I remember this being a highlight to the evening.<BR><BR>I was at the time maybe 8 years old and my mother and I on this particular night in the late 70''s commenced our ride around the roads to see if we sould see any deer. It had been raining earlier with thunder and lightning mixed in. Now it was just raining. We were rounding a corner on one of the roads that paralleled the Indian Cedar Swamp and as we started downward,  we noticed the road was obstructed by a large blown down oak tree, the tree had green leaves (this makes me think it was summer or the early fall) on it so it had recently come down, we guessed maybe in the storm earlier(possibly lightning).<BR><BR>The road was very narrow and the brush along the side of the road made it difficult to back the car around to turn around. The rain was falling but not heavy, the wipers were on, the headlights on the car were on as well.<BR><BR>As my mother turned the front end  of the car the lights cast on the left side of the road where the tree had been broken off from its stump. We were maybe 1 1/2 car lengths from the stump. Beside the tall fractured stump stood what looked like a large white(yellow white) ape. It was maybe 6 to 7 feet tall, its hair was long, face flat, long massive arms, its head appeared to be without any neck, its chest was broad.<BR><BR>My mother and I froze momentarily (5 seconds, maybe 10) and the figure remained still, staring at us. My mother floored the car into reverse. I remember ther terror of it all. The sound of gravel hitting inside the fender wells, the sound of the brush crushing against the car and then the acceleration as she sped off.<BR><BR>We were clear as to what we saw and we have no question in our mind that we saw something or someone in ape like shape that night. This we are certain of. We need no one to tall us what we saw, it''s crystal clear.<BR><BR>For years we told no one. We would talk about it in our home in privacy and even my father found this story hard to accept. We''ve never forgotten this and this story would have never been told if it wasn''t for someone else informing me of a similar sigthing.<BR><BR>I''m now in my 30''s an extremely active hunter, farmer and woodsman. I hunt deer 40 days a year in Maine, RI, CT and New Jersey. I use automated cameras which are triggered by heat. I''ve never seen a picture of a bigfoot on my film. I have seen pictures of deer on my 50 acre tract of land that I would never believe are there if I didn''t see it on my film. I know every inch of my land and the surrounding property and these mystery deer show up at all hours on my cameras and frequently at that. How can they move right around our hunting parties in such a small area and never be seen, I''ll never know,<BR><BR>Even today I find it hard to accept what we definitely saw. I''m not a fan of ghosts, UFO''s or even big foot. I''m not sure to this day what I saw wasn''t a man in a costume, dressed up, out in rainstorm, a half mile or more from any home, waiting for my mother and me to drive down the road to give us a scare. The only thing I can say is it was a damn'' good costume and a damn'' good plan. We saw what we saw and this is something I would sware to on any polygraph test as I''m sure my mother would.<BR><BR>",

    " The exact date was October 15, 1998. I was training for a mountain bike race and this was to be my last ride prior to the race. I was riding at the Black Hut Management Area in Glendale,RI. Along for the ride was my three year old mixed breed (shepard/lab)large dog.<BR>It was sunny but cool and I planned to spend an hour or so breaking a swet. <BR>As i weaved my way through the trails, i had to leash my dog to cross a street. After I unhooked him we started up a hill toward a chasam. It''s small and kids hang around there and drink beer, have fires etc. At the crest of the hill I could see the top of the chasam (approx. 50 yards away). Out of the corner of my eye I noticed something that first appeared to be a dirty white blanket perhaps hung on a small tree. Suddenly (I think it heard us)it turned (as it was squatting with it''s back to me)saw me stood up and disapeared into the woods. I was shocked and could not believe what I had just saw. From my vantage point I would say the animal was white or grey but very dirty. In no way did it resemble a man. I did not see the face clearly. But from what I did see (full rear view) although it stood fairly erect, it''s gate and posture was like an ape. The arms were not long like a gorilla and oddly it was no were near seven-feet tall. I''d estimate maybe six feet at best.<BR>I reversed my direction and rode immediately to the top of the chasam. I looked for footprints and hair but didn''t find any. I walked a short distance in the woods in the direction were it disapeared. My heart was pounding so loud I could hear it. I knew it was no were in the general area because my dog was not barking. Anytime there is an animal near fox, coyote, deer, my dog barks and will usally chase. Interesting point is that my dog never barked and I don''t think he saw, heard or smelled it. I noticed no unusual smell in the area. And also noted no signs of broken branches and no way to determine its direction. <BR>I''ve told one or two people and in November of 1998 a friend and I (with video and digital camera) spent two weekends hiking in the area directly behind the chasam with no results. I also snow shoed the area after the first snow. I was starting to believe I had imagined it. In 2002 I met a hunter in a bar and asked him if he ever hunted at Black Hut. He said \"yes\", \"and once I saw a white gorilla there! I had chills and related my story. The differences were in color, he stated white (the one i saw was more grey) and said the one he saw was eight feet tall. Still, same place same type of sighting.<BR>What made me write this is the two other RI sightings seem to be similar. I wish I could have seen it longer and closer.         <BR>     ",

    "   While attending U.R.I in the Fall of 1974,I would stay at my girlfriends mother''s house on weekends because I only had a five day mealbook plan.<BR>  It was Sunday evening about 10:00pm when I decided to head back to school on my ten speed bike. Very dark in the area because it being mostly wooded, country like setting but yet city. I was going down her street and noticed my front center pull brake needed to be adjusted. I stopped under a street light at the end of her street which is an intersection to adjust the brake. Directly in front of me was a small field that sloped down and away from me,pitch black background, tall grass and a few bushes being light by the street light. Typical New England, Oak, Maple and, Pine trees.<BR>  As I was fixing my brake I began hearing very loud foot steps of a biped, comig from the field on the slope side,more like a crushing thud. I could hear the actual compression being placed, like someone dropping a heavy metal ball/rock on the ground.I looked up to see if I could see anything and just said to myself \"its nothing\", and went back to fixing my brake. I noticed it was getting closer and felt very apprehensive, the sound was coming in my direction. All of sudden this dog starts barking like crazy, I can hear the chain snap as it either tries to attack or getaway from something.<BR>  I said to myself \"its time to go!\", as I started I turned left to head north, into a few pedals.<BR>From out of the darkness steps into the street light this white looking gorilla. The legs present themselves then the body as it comes to rest on its knuckles. Twenty maybe twenty five feet away, directly across the street from me perhads six feet tall maybe 400 pounds or more. Massive arms that went straight down on its knuckles, knees slight bent.The head is higher in the back connected to the neck all-in-one mass. The face dark, deep strong  but primate.The eyes are close together and set deep in the face. The nose and mouth are human like, it''s nose is wide, around the mouth black hair that went down on each side.It looks up with its head and chest see me, eyeball to eyeball as I look back trying to see if this thing is real. Humanlike in appearance, the face is not like a primate but has a distinct animal presence (the eye are close together). I was never so scared in my life and knew had I stayed I don''t think I would of survived the attack.The way it was positioned gave it an explosive start as it decides to chase me down the street. My heart was pounding out of my chest, my eyes had tears in them and with all my might I pedaled as it ran on two legs, then down on its knuckles then back up again. Perhaps for ten yards, I remember how its long hair on its arms moved with each reach,I thank god I was in first gear. A good five second chase and it was all over.It had stopped in the middle of the street just swaying back and forth, turned and just cleared this rock wall all in one motion from a grass sidewalk. At the top of hill I began riding in circles, I didn''t know what to do, I could not comprehend the situation I was in. I knew one thing I was not riding back. I cut through her grandmother''s yards and made it back to her house. Not trying to look crazy or anything they ask me what''s wrong ? I told them what happened and agreed  that it was best to go back in the morning.",

    "  I am 61-yo and have been an outdoorsman all of my life doing numerous backpacking and mountaineering trips in the Cascades and Olympics. I have a degree in psychology from the UW and currently employed as an Investigator. <BR><BR>My 15-yo son and I made camp at twilight off FS road 25,  after doing a recon of the Lewis River area for hunting. It is a rain forest there with huge cedar trees and large moss-covered maples reminding me of the Hoh Rain Forest. We set up camp on the east side of a creek. We had my 4-Runner parked and set up a tent. <BR><BR> After a steak dinner, I made some howls in the manner of the \"Ohio howls\" that I had made that had called in a Squatch at Lake Ozette (report #65667). I am a trained vocalist and can project my voice considerably. After no response, we retired for the evening.<BR><BR> At approx 10 pm, we were awakened by a loud crack of a branch very close to our tent. I jumped out of my bag with a 400-lumen flashlight and searched 360 degrees hoping to spot the culprit. After several minutes and intense searching to no avail, we went back to sleep only to be woken by howls off in the distance to the south of us an hour later. I would guess that the howls were coming from a single individual approx a mile away from us. My son reported that he had heard footsteps later near the tent that night but failed to wake me. <BR><BR> In the morning, my son discovered a single footprint near the tent. I have photos. It is a very wide right footprint approx a size 13 that was very deep (1/2 inch) in the dirt. I am sure the print is still there as it has not rained since drafting this report. Despite a large rock in the near middle of the arch, the print is deep and was not affected by it. I could not make a print at all and I weigh 250lbs.<BR><BR> I have always been keenly interested in Sasquatch and was convinced that they exist after reading Dr. Meldrum''s Where legend Meets Science book.  I have had encounters after mimicking the Ohio Howl with remarkable success. I suspect the government has proof and is keeping it quiet to protect this cryptohominid with wilderness areas (Lone Butte/Indian Heaven). I am studying maps of an area I reasoned to be prime habitat and have a trip planned overland off-trail/road soon. Time to get serious... ",

    " I have recently become very interested in bigfoot research, and based on reports that I found on this website of previous incidents in the area, decided to go to Great Swamp in Rhode Island to look for any evidence of bigfoot. After walking thirty to forty minutes down the main trail beginning from Great Neck Road, I took a smaller path off of the trail for about five minutes. That is when I noticed a young tree that was snapped in half at about six feet off the ground. More noteworthy, however, was a stick formation that I found a little bit farther down the path on a slightly elevated area of land. It was small, maybe three feet high, but constructed in the same woven-looking manner characteristic of other possible bigfoot stick formations. Other than that, I did not find anything else unusual. It may not be extremely compelling evidence, but I figured it was worth telling experts, who could then take it as far as they saw fit.",

    " My girlfriend and I were staying at her parent''s house near Marlborough, New Hampshire.  I am writing on her behalf because of my access to the internet.  I also have an interest in bigfoot related stories and lore and so am familiar with this website.  However, I have not had any experiences or encounters myself.  <BR>This particular night, my girlfriend was startled by an unusual howling scream while watching t.v. at approximately 11:45 p.m. (her father and I were asleep and did not hear anything).  The howling scream seemed to eminate from across the street in an area that is heavily wooded.  At the first scream she thought that she must have heared an injured person''s cry.  There were approximately four screams (although she is unsure about this), each about 5 seconds apart.  After hearing the second scream she went to the front door (about 10'' from her) and stood outside on the stoop where she heard the last two screams.<BR>She estimated the distance to the screams as approximately 400 feet, to the other side of the street where there is a solitary house.  I believe, however, that the screams may have been much farther away.  She says that they were ''very loud'' and stationary, i.e. they didn''t sound louder or fainter with each progressive one.  She also notes that they sounded as if from around the corner of the house, not a clear shot from her to the point of origin.  In other words, she doesn''t beleive that the ''animal'' could have seen her at the front door.<BR>The next day she described what she heard to me and I immediately thought of the recordings from your site.  Her description sounded alike.  After returning from our trip I played the recordings to her (over the phone) and she says, \"identical,\" specifically the 1978 recording from Snohomish County, Washington.   ",

    " Audio Experience only:<BR><BR>Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, wooo....<BR><BR>Sunday, September 12, 2004 at about 03:00 AM<BR>I was woken up from a sound sleep by a very loud noise.  I listened for a while and tried to figure out what could make such a loud, repetitive noise.  It wasn''t a coyote howl or fishercat screach, didn''t sound like any owl I know of, wasn''t a raccoon or tree rodent...  After 15 - 20 minutes, I went to sleep.<BR><BR>My dog woke me with frightened barking at 4:00 AM when the sound was twice as loud and I knew the critter was within 100 feet of the house.  Also, there were two responding calls, one sounded fairly close and one was in the distance.  I got up to make sure the sheep were OK in their pasture with an electric fence around it and there was nothing by the barn where the goats were.  I flashed the light over to the chicken coop and nothing was there either.  I flashed the light throughout the yard and into the trees to see if there was any clue or any danger to the animals.  I saw nothing and while I shone the light, the calls ceased.<BR><BR>All day I asked EVERYONE if they knew of any local animal that made the noise and repeated it all day long.  A friend suggested that I look it up on the internet.  I listened to all sorts of animal vocalizations with no luck.  When I finally typed in the words of the actual sound it was an identical match to this site!!!  I''m not saying I had a bigfoot encounter, but I definately encountered whatever the campers up in Lincoln, NH encountered last summer!!!  There may be a rational explaination and someone may know of an indigenous animal that makes that sound -- and trust that I will still try to find out what it is... but the sound will resonate in my memory -- as it was like no other animal/bird I''ve ever heard.  It was not too fast, nor garbled, it was incredibly loud and clear.  The dog was very nervous.",

    "       I moved to this location in New Hampshire  in 2001. I have had several sightings over the past few years. Usually from my living room while I am watching television. I know this sounds weird. But, I am serious. My couch sits facing my picture window. Beyond the picture window, there is a small creek and an empty wooded lot. I have seen deer, bear, turkey, racoons, moose and fox on my property.  It is in a part of Gilford called Gunstock Acres. It usually happens in the late evening on a dark summer night. No paticular date or time. From the ground to the top of the window has got to be at least 10 feet tall. This creature is about 9 feet in height. Dark deep brownish long hair, and walks upright, similar to a human. I have seen it go one direction, then go past the window in the other direction several minutes later, or it just walks away until the next time I see it, which has been about once a year. I have seen it looking more like a shadow when my lights in the house are on. I am usually caught off guard, and am startled when I''ve seen it, in disbelief, but there is no other explanation. <BR>      Last summer I happened to tell my husband and family that I saw Bigfoot again last night and my oldest son said he seen it the night before, passing by the window, and it looked right in at him as it was passing by. He described the same creature except that he saw the face. And he swears it is a Bigfoot too.  He was creeped out about it, and I think he still is. My son is in his 20''s.<BR>      This is part of the Great North Woods, with lakes, mountains, rivers & caves. Plenty of places to hide. I have heard strange grunting noises, tree limbs breaking, screams, and walking sounds through my wooded lot. I refuse to go outside after I have seen it, and turn all the outside lights on, until I forget about it again. We have seen some huge prints out there in the winter going around the house, but they were unidentifiable.  Due to the large amounts of snow we have gotten during storms, the tracks get filled in.<BR>      I am spooked by it, but it hasn''t done anything to any of us, except  look in the window at us.<BR>      I know what I have seen, and I haven''t told many people as they would think we were crazy. So, my family and I would like to know what this creature is, and is it possible that it is a Bigfoot? We beleive it is, as we know what we have seen. It can''t be a black bear, as this is too tall, and walks a distance on two legs and like a human, so it couldn''t be a moose either.  It is built like a really large broad-shouldered man, and muscular, but covered in hair. My son said that the face is hairy also, but the skin on the face is a lighter color than the rest of the body. ",

Then it turned straight & strided toward the edge of the road. There was no path on either side of the road just very thick woods & underbrush. We have stone walls everywhere here in NH. The creature never broke stride as it stepped lithfully over the stone wall & slid with ease through the thick under-brush. A human would have to bend down to use hands to clumsily straddle the stonewall, to get to the other side. There are no houses to \"trick-or-treat\". And who would be out in the middle of nowhere, in the near freezing (35*) cold, just mosying through the thick pickerbrush in a hairy costume?!?!?! We had never heard of bigfoot, didn''t know such a thing existed.There is also a family up in the woods of the Gilmanton area who have had Bigfoot visits for years. They leave out leftovers every so often & get thank you gifts in the next couple days.

    " In one part of Bearbrook State Park is the Girl Scout Day Camp location. Across the street from New Rye Rd is the Camping Museum & the Snowmobile Museum. There used to be a nature museum. If you keep going straight on that dirt path, you wind yourself up into the Girl Scout Campground. It was a 2 week event. The older campers were allowed to have a single overnight in the last few days. It was ''67/''68, late July. There were 3, 5-person tents, I was a senior and in the tent closest to the woods. The evening was spent cooking hotdogs & hamburgers & marshmallows & sa''mores with lots of singing laughing & screaming. We all retired around 10 pm. In the middle of the night, around 1 or 2 am, I was woken by something softly grunting & pushing down on the top of the tent. We have racoons but no bears in (I get the irony) Bear Brook State Park. The other girls in my tent were trying to stay quiet, but still panicking not so quietly. I said \" it''s just one of the other girls.\" I am a camper since age 9 with a father who was a practical joker. So I said loudly \"That''s not how you do it. This is how it is done\" & I dug my nails into the canvas & making a roaring growling sound clawed down the canvas hard & fast & hit something soft but solid on the outside of the cloth. I was picturing a man''s hand/fist kind of like knuckles???. There was a loud grunt/growl & crashing away from us through the underbrush just on the other side of the tent. Now the girls in my tent are screaming hysterically about bears, The rest of the campers are opening my tent and all pandemonium broke loose. No-one admitted to playing a prank. & the leaders in the other 2 tents all day insisted everyone was accounted for & no one had left the tents not even a potty run. There was a funky smell though, that no-one could recognize. The park rangers swore there were none in the area, they were all up north for the summer. We had never heard of bigfoot, I fear I am repeating myself, so didn''t even know such a thing existed. So, unexplainable incident, that with hindsight, I am thinking, could it have been???

From inside the house we heard what we thought was barking constantly.  We own several dogs so we were used to it.  this continued for about an hour or two then quieted down.  Later on that evening about 2am or so we heard the most bloodcurdling sound ever.  The only way i can describe it is like about 20 dogs all screaming and yaulping at once in a shrill chorused scream.  We haven''t heard it again but it came from across the farmer''s field in the woods across from The speedway.  I''d have to say the date was around January 10th or so.  We have heard other things too and seen plenty of deer...but never heading across the field.  We don''t know what it was and did not see it at all.

    " My boyfriend and two sons (age 5 & 10) were camping in Upton, Maine.  On July 3rd, 1998 we took a ride into Parmachenee Lake.  The road to get there is off Rt. 16 in Wilsons Mills, ME.  We drove around most of the day, stopped for a cookout on someones lot and then headed out in the early afternoon.   It was before 4:00 p.m.   We were riding in a truck, my friend driving and the two boys in the middle and I was on the passenger side.   We came out of what I would call a wooded area at the top of a small hill, the hill rounded a small corner and then straightened out at the bottom.  The entire area on the right side was an open area at the bottom, the left side was wooded.  There were no vehicles around there or anywhere for that matter.   Just as we rounded we could see at the very bottom of the slight downgrade (approx. 100-150 yds).   We both saw it at the same time.  He looked at me immediately and said \"what did you just see\", I looked at him and without even thinking and said \"saskatchewan\".   <BR>What we saw was something unimaginable.   The creature (?) was standing on two legs, was very tall (approx. 7 feet), skinney and was totally covered with long brown hair/fur.  What was amazing was this creature never even acknowledged that we were coming towards him in the truck, although we were not close enough to hit it, it never acknowledged.   The other amazing thing was that it''s strides were huge.  It took it probably three strides to cross the dirt road, which was wide enough for two vehicles.   It''s gait was very stoic.   We got down to the bottom within seconds, we slowed right down almost to a stop and looked into the woods.   There was nothing in there.   My boyfriend wanted to stop but I wouldn''t let him because of the children.  We also stopped discussing it at that time in fear of scaring the kids.  There were no tracks on the ground.   We intended to return the next day to see if we could track anything but it rained really hard that night so we figured any tracks were gone.<BR>I told this story to very few people because I know it''s hard to believe.   I did tell one of the foresters that worked where I did.   This road we went on is gated and I was able to get a key from my employer.   This is why I mentioned it to the forester.  I was hoping maybe he had heard similar stories.    <BR>The creature was on Bose Buck Mountain and headed towards Aziscohos Lake.   Also in that area was an old gate near mile marker #12.<BR><BR><BR>",

    " While on vacation with my wife in northern NH/ME area called Lake Aziscohos. we decided to go moose antler hunting to find some dropped racks. while heading into a clearing we started following moose tracks, we went further past the clearing and came to a small water run-off ditch. Well in this small ditch we saw a very unusual track for anywhere in the northeast, a five toe''d track that was HUGE!!! I took pictures, I did not have casting material, but i do have pictures with an altoids box for size comparison, we estimated this track to be between 20-22\" long and I''d say about 8-10\" wide. this was NOT, I repeat NOT like any other tracks we have seen, the track had no claw marks, I''ve been an avid watcher of Finding Bigfoot and do wood knocks regularly along with screams.

Surprisingly it got out of the reeds from crouched to standing turned around and ran towards the wooded area up a hill and was moving with it''s arms brush and tree branches out of the way. It was incredibly fast runner and I got a good look at its coconut shaped head as it ran away. It was light brown/brown. It had incredibly broad shoulders. I went back the same day. The marsh went up to my knees and I could smell a bad odor like garbage. Myself and a friend went back to the sighting. We found a footprint and a hair sample. I could hear wood knocks when my friend James did a call and we also found a large bed of branches and some tree structures.

We walked to the end of the dirt road and along that road is a tree lining of woods. As we started heading back I looked over a noticed a tall figure staring at me at the edge of the woods. I couldnt make out what it was. It was definitely taller than 7ft and stood on two legs. It had orangish eyes. I started walking back down the road towards my house and when I would stop it would stop an look at me. I would walk some more, so would the thing and then once I stopped it stopped and would look at me. At this point I was really freaked out so I yelled for my dog to run and we sprinted towards the house.

I was about an hour into my trek and I see off the beaten path a series of footprints. The snow had stopped yesterday and I tell you these prints were FRESH. I am thinking I just missed that squatch by a matter of minutes or hours! SO CLOSE! Well, let me tell you what!! These things were 12'''' long and the stride between steps was measured at 8 feet! The line of prints was straight, just like you see with other evidence of a bigfoot trail! It was INSANE. There were no other prints around, I followed these about a quarter mile into the depths of the woods and off the beaten path. The snow was up past my knees at some points but how could I stop following this epic trail! I could see some prints more clearly than others, I could see toe outlines and the heel in a few! I have pictures and videos to share with you. By the looks of the size of the prints and the distance in stride, this seems like an adult sasquatch, These things were huge!! The sun was setting and my phone was dying so to my dismay I had to turn around and get back to the path before dark, otherwise I would have followed those tracks until they lead me to whatever made them, and we know what made those beasts! This is the BEST day ever. My very first bigfoot evidence and experience and I couldn''t be happier!!!

    "  In the spring of 1974 my girlfriend and I were returning from a motorcycle rally at Laconia NH.It was late at night and we decided to camp out.I found a small gravel road and we found a remote place to set up my small 2 man tent.This area is referred to as the pine barrens in the Kennebunk area of Maine.It has very thick scrub pine growth. <BR> About an hour or so after camping I could hear movement near the tent but was not too concerned because there is a lot of wildlife in the barrens.The movement got closer and there was this really pungent order.I thought \"uh-oh it''s a bear\"but was still not concerned as black bears are mostly just curious and usually will not bother you.<BR> I should add here that I have spent a lot of time in the woods as my mother and father were both Maine guides and the woods was my life.I have heard all the noises that wildlife makes in different seasons.I consider myself a good tracker and know the habits etc. of most animals.<BR> Then it happened:Whatever it was let out a scream that made every hair on my body stand striaght out and nearly gave me a heart attack.I am saying to myself\"this is no bear.\"Now the girlfriend is awake and in hysterics.I am trying to quiet her so I can keep track of whatever it is.It moved close enough to the tent so I could actually feel it''s movement through the ground and hear it breathing.This activity went on for about 20 minutes and it went away.<BR> After a sleeplees night and at first light I crawled out to investigate.I looked for tracks.There were no clear imprints,only impessions in the grass and some broken ferns etc.The impessions were about half again as big as my own.I wear a size 11.I followed the tracks and they ended at a cliff that was about 30 feet high.I wanted to investigate further but the girlfriend was haveing none of it and wanted to leave.I went back a couple of times by myself to that area but never found any further signs in the area.<BR> This all would have been disturbing enough but that year I was liesurly sipping a beer an watching a documentry on bigfoot with my girlfriend when they played a recording that was supposed to be a bigfoot scream.YOu guessed it...Hair straight out and and an exclamation from both of us of \"Oh sh--!\"If that was bigfoot then we have been very close to him.",

It stopped when it noticed us and took a fast left turn into the woods. <BR><BR>From the power lines to the road is roughly 400 ft of woods and has a trail about 30 feet behind where we saw the creature that goes straight to the road. I jumped on the 4 wheeler and made a straight shot down that trail to the road to try and get a closer view. It was completely gone.

    " I am a Ph.D. environmental physiologist working for Natick Labs in Massachusetts. In the fall of 1970, I was hunting on the east side of the lake [Long Pond] in Baxter State Forest with Danny Wolfe, a vet now in Ohio, a friend from Montana (deceased) and another vet. One morning I hunted alone south of the lake, when I encountered a strange musky smell in the woods along with a foot-long black scat that looked human except for the extraordinary thickness and width. I also observed small scat that looked like a large pile of baby feces with white and yellow texture. As I proceeded on, I was confronted with the sound of thumping like a partridge on steroids drumming. The ground actually shook. The hair on my neck was raised and the pit of my stomach seemed suddenly queasy as the rotten smell got worse. Suddenly, a large dead tree came crashing down about a hundred yards in front of me. This scared the s... out of me, as the woods were deathly quiet, no wind, no birds etc. I returned to camp and was severely guffawed by the two vets, Dr. Heisel and Dr. Wolfe.<BR><BR> Wolfe, however, agreed to accompany me the next day. We went further into the swampy woods, saw yesterday''s scat and Danny said whatever it was it was certainly big to push that dead tree down. We continued until the area became quite rocky with boulders larger than our heads on all sides. Danny said this doesn''t look like a good place to be because something could jump us before we could react. Suddenly, we encountered the drumming and ground shaking again. This was followed by a huge rock, which flew over our heads and impacted on a hill to our left. Needless to say, we were both speechless and Danny said whatever could throw a fifty-pound rock fifty yards was not something he would care to encounter. Even though Danny had a 7 mm mag and I had a 270, we both agreed to leave.  It was quite evident that whatever we had pissed off was clearly warning us not to go further.  We returned to camp and my two friends became believers. <BR><BR>The hunt was a failure because there were no signs of deer or even moose in the area. We have enjoyed retelling this story to our kids and friends over the years because none of us had ever experienced anything like it in years of hunting in Me, NH, MA, Montana or Colorado. It was the scariest thing I have ever encountered in my hunting career. <BR><BR>I have shot elk in Colorado and this year my wife and I shot over fifty pheasants and five deer. I am on the Board of Advisors of the Uxbridge Rod and Gun club, and as the Army''s former expert on desert survival and heatstroke physiology (Editorial Board of Wilderness and Environmental Medicine; I wrote the survival manual for Desert Storm and Desert Shield). I have published over 200 scientific papers, abstracts, and book chapters. But this is the first time I have written about this strange encounter! I am 65 and have retired from Army Environmental Medicine as a lab director.<BR>",

    " Background:  I have spent a large part of my life in the woods between Eddington where I grew up and Deblois where my Grandfather built a hunting / fishing camp in the 1920s  everywhere in between hunting, fishing, camping and hiking.  I have walked those woods since I was 4 years old and Im now 61  I know the deer, moose , bear and other wildlife of those woods.  I built my camp on Spectacle Pond in Osborn in 1988.  I have spent a lot of time in the years since exploring the woods and waters around the camp over the years and know the area between Route 179 and Route 193 better than most and within 10 miles of my camp, better than anyone.  Since 2008 when I retired from the U.S. Navy, I have spent one month every year at my camp  2 weeks in May, fishing and 2 weeks in November, hunting.  I have spent many days and nights in the most remote areas of that part of Maine.<BR><BR>On the evening of November 12th  2020, my wife and I had returned to our camp after an afternoon deer hunt, it was dark by the time we got back to camp and settled in for a routine evening with getting the camp warmed up, supper, a couple hands of cribbage and talking  we had been in camp for 10 days.  At around 8:30 my wife decided to go to bed as we planned to hunt the morning.  I picked up my book and was reading until 10:30.  The only light within a half mile of my camp was the single gas light in the front room of the camp which I was using to read  the nearest people were 0.5 mile away in their camp back toward Route 9.  I decided to call it a night at 10:30 and wanted to relieve myself before I went to bed so I went outside across the porch, down the front steps and walked approximately 15 feet to the back outside corner of the camp.  Within seconds of standing in that spot there was two very loud THWACK sounds just inside the woodline which is 15 yards across the back yard.  It took me by surprise as Ive never heard that sound before completely by myself in the woods.  It sounded identical to someone taking a large stick of firewood and hitting a tree in full swing.  I could easily replicate that noise as in knocking snow/ice off firewood against a tree, but with force.  I did not have a flashlight with me as the diffused light from the gas light inside the camp gave me enough point of reference to get back inside so I didnt think to bring one with me.  I stood there perplexed as to what I had just heard and trying to make sense of it, when it happened againTHWACK but this time a little farther away  maybe 25-30 yards, but still quite loud.  This repeated itself 10 or 11 times over a period of maybe 2 to 3 minutes, each time a little more distant than before.  I remained standing there as I was still trying to figure out what it was THWACKing these trees.  After the hitting of trees dissipated, I returned to the camp and locked the door  I didnt (and still dont) know what it was but I knew it wasnt a person, moose, deer or bear!  Of note, there was absolutely no light as in a flashlight from a person.  Additionally, those woods are extremely thick with dead spruce and fir  lots of blowdowns yet there was absolutely no noise  no snapping branches, breaking twigs. Nothing  Silence.  I can tell you first hand that nobody could walk down through there in broad daylight, much less at night without a flashlight without snapping branches and making a lot of noise. I spent an additional hour in the camp that night reflecting on what I had heard and trying to attribute it to something that made sense  there was none in all of my experience.  I went to bed and when we got up Friday morning, we decided to hang out at camp to get a start on packing and cleaning as we were closing up camp and leaving on Saturday.  I walked into the woods during daylight where I heard the THWACK noises the night before but found nothing where I expected to see some type of sign.  Needless to say, I didnt tell my wife about those events until Saturday morning as we were getting ready to leave. I still have no idea what it was and it was so dark, I didnt see anything but I can tell you that Ive never heard or experienced anything like that in the many years Ive spent in those woods and the 30+ years Ive owned that camp.

    " I was not in any way aware that these creatures existed in Maine, firstly. I am from Connecticut however I have spent years in desolate oilfields across the U.S. including places like West Texas, the upper Peninsula of Michigan, and the Everglades of Florida. I have a vast knowledge of wildlife as I have always taken an interest to it and spent years IN the forest. My point is, what I experienced this day has shaken me to the core as I know my encounter was nothing \"normal\". <BR><BR>In the Northwoods of Maine in a town called Greenbush, (population 1,400) I purchased 80 acres of wilderness with virgin forest on the back half of the lot. (meaning not even loggers have been there, it''s that desolate.) I had rented an excavator and for this entire day I had been cutting a road through swamp, hills and forests to a high hill I call Hope Hill on the virgin most desolate corner of my land where I want to build my cabin.<BR><BR>I had made it halfway and in the swamp I realized I was out of fuel. I shut down the machine and get out. I step down onto to road and was admiring my work and just relishing in the whole idea of pioneering this new path. <BR><BR>Suddenly about 50 yards into the tree line I hear a bang with a stick on to a tree. Like someone was hitting a wooden bat against a large tree trunk as the percussion was unmistakable... At first I thought \"Oh crap there is a moose\" because it is mating season for them and they are known to ram their antlers against trees to intimidate their foes. <BR><BR>Suddenly, the sound happens again. Now I am certain this is no moose as no branches are breaking, there is movement, no grunts, nothing... Just this wooden thump just through the trees where I can''t see.<BR><BR>I begin walking further away because I''m obviously freaked out. Again, but now 2 knocks... I grab a large branch I had just ripped down with the machine and smacked it against a large tree trunk. Immediately I received a knock in response. I wait around 45 seconds.... I knock again, BANG it knocks right after me again... I knock again 5 seconds later, it responds again right back.... <BR><BR>Now I am shaking because I know what I presume this creature to be. It''s obviously strong because the bang was very loud. Intimidating... I knew there was a certainty I was interacting with Sasqauch. <BR><BR>I went back to my trailer on my qaud which was parked about 200 feet down the trail. I FLEW home. I calm down, now I am questioning reality and am quite, scared I guess. This is my land, I''m only halfway through making the road, these are my thoughts, so I decide to ride back...<BR><BR>I knock again. It responds. I take my phone out. Turn on record on video, I knock, it goes away... Almost as if it knew I was recording. Regardless it was incredibly perplexing. I got back on the quad and went back home knowing for sure what I just experienced was legitimate.<BR><BR>I brought a feather bead string thing from a dream catcher and brought it out there as a gift. It''s been 3 days. I haven''t gone back to see if it''s still there.",

    " About 12 years ago Carla, Cindy and myself, Brian, took a road trip to Brown creek, in Washington state. Went down a dirt road to the end where it met the river. I (Brian) went fishing going down steam while Carla and Cindy walked up river, I walked around a bend I saw a big tree that looked like lightning hit it, but while looking at it better, steam was coming off it, then the top foot and a half turned slowly to where I saw the whites of its eyes, his hair looked like bark, he was squatting, sitting on it heals with knees to its chest, it really looked like a tree broken off. A little one,  a 6 footer, jumped over some rocks and logs and was gone, the big one sitting on its heels was 7-to 8 foot, 3-4 feet wide, It was not scared of me, I ran up river to find the girls, found them and said I wanted to show them something weird, as us three went back, sure enough it was still there. The top turned again looking at us all, approx 25 yards away, we ran as fast as we could to the van in which you could see where this happened but nothing was there.

    " I took a 3 day/2 night solo backpacking trip in Washington state, up the Ape Canyon Trail, around the base of Mt. St. Helens, and through the Muddy River drainage this past July 5th through 7th.   On the  first day of the hike at around 1 pm, as I made my way up the Ape  Canyon Trail, I was surprised to hear a series of \"whooping\" calls, a  series of 5 whoops in a row spaced at intervals of about 30 seconds to  1 minute apart, 5-7 sets over the course 10-15 minutes.  The calls (bwaaahh-bwaaahh-bwaaahh) sounded as if they were emanating  from the bottom of an oil drum, the tone being deep and bodily palpable, even though sounding maybe a mile or more away in the direction of the canyon, and somewhat north of the trail. It struck  me as unnaturally deep and projecting (although not overly loud) and unlike any animal call I had ever heard before (I have hiked and camped in forest and wilderness areas for many years).  I did not hear any  other calls during course of my hike, save what sounded like an  enormous owl hooting near my tent site on the edge of the Muddy River drainage on my 2nd night, at around 2 am.  It was very loud and I was not inclined to get out of my tent for a look-see.  One other thing I found intrigued me though.  On a game trail that slips off of the main trail, just down hill from a ground spring adjacent to the trail 1-2 miles from the trailhead, I came across a couple of downed trees approx. 4-5\" in diameter, twisted or snapped off and laying across the trail in a cross-x pattern. The trees were placed on the trail between the spring and a small meadow farther down the hill.   There were no signs of a lightening strike, no evidence of chopping or sawing was apparent, and the trees looked otherwise healthy and normal, and looked as if they had been pulled over and broken off toward the top of the tree.",

    " When I was about 10 years old my father took me and a friend camping up in Indian Heaven. We parked and then hiked about 3 miles uphill to Lake Wapiki there. It was beautiful mid August and hot. While hiking up to the camp spot I remember having a sense of someone looking at me from the forest. I do have a big imagination though so I didn''t think to much about it.<BR> We arrived at our camp spot and set everything up. We were camping next to a large dried up creek bed and I remember looking at it and following it a little ways down. Picking huckleberries and exploring the rest of the area, I spent the rest of my day just having fun.<BR>  That night, after I and my friend and Dad had gone to bed, we were awakened by a stampede of deer or elk or something. There were at least 10 because it lasted about 20 to 30 seconds and they were running right through our camp. Scared the hell out of me. I remember my Dad getting up and making sure we were all right. Everything was fine and so I slowly fell back asleep.<BR> Next morning I woke up and looked around and it looked like some of our cooking gear was scattered about the camp, probably from the stampede running right through. And then I saw it what makes me believe in Bigfoot. There in the dried creek bed was a huge footprint. And i''m not talking about a human print. Though this foot print could have been made by a man, it was way too big and wide. I estimate a size 20 and it was like 4 to 5 inches across. Huge foot print. Scared me half to death.<BR> I was thinking about it and I think a bigfoot had scared the deer or elk into the stampede. So there is my story about bigfoot. I believe 100% in bigfoot. I know this story isn''t all that. It''s not like I saw him or anything but what i saw made me believe.<BR><BR>   <BR>",

    " I put together a mountain bike trip with a cousin for a weekend in Central Vermont near the town of Plymouth in the Calvin Coolidge state forest. <BR><BR>We decided on a Lean-To shelter called TinkerBrook on the outskirts of the forest near the backside of Killington Peak. One reason for this location was because of the steep topography the area offered for a mountain biker. Also, not to many people visit this shelter according to the Rangers I''ve talked to before due to the hike in and lack of 4x4 access as well. The place offers nothing more than a view of a steep forested ravine. The shelter is right on the edge of this ravine as well.<BR><BR>We travelled up Shrewsbury road which intersects RT100 south of Plymouth and then heads west almost straight up the nearest mountain in a series of switchbacks. We then parked our vehicle on the bend in the road where tinkerbrook shelter trail starts. The trail/road is heavily blocked off by boulders and easy to miss. We packed up the bikes and headed down the old trail/road to the shelter. The shelter is about a 3/4 mile off the forest road we parked the vehicle on.<BR><BR>We set up camp for the night in the shelter and did a look around. The place offered no trails to ride on and the ravine was so steep that you needed to climb out of it using the roots of the trees in it. The place was very isolated.<BR><BR>We headed off to bed around 9:00pm and left a campfire going near the opening of the shelter. A few hours later (12:00am) my cousin woke me up saying that he was hearing and feeling knocks on the shelter. I told him to go back to sleep. Then I heard and felt the noises myself.<BR><BR>The sounds were like something big pushing against the shelter. I thought it could of been a moose or bear and decided to go around back to see. I took a flashlight and went around back within a minute of hearing the noise again. There was nothing there to see.<BR><BR>This continued a few more times during the night until maybe 3:00am. I felt the bumping sounds near my side of the shelter on occasion. We didn''t get much sleep and at one point I even pulled all the firewood close to the opening to keep a large fire going.<BR><BR>In the morning we looked for any damage to the shelter and found nothing. We also looked around for any sign on the ground (footprints, loose rocks, scrapes and hoofmarks) but found nothing.<BR><BR>We decided not to stay another night and headed out. <BR><BR>",

    " I research mountain lions in NH, but I was caring for my mother and hadn''t gotten out since Christmas Day, 2014. On 5/24/15 I decided to just go for a walk, no research. I did a Meet-up with someone who walked much faster than me. She left me at the power line. I was way downhill, but was determined to at least make it to the power line. <BR>I did, but when I turned back to go down to the car, I saw two huge prints near a tree by the trail. When I got to them, the heels were 3-4 inches deep in the soil and leaves. They touched and the toes went out and away from each other like a duck''s feet. They seemed to be 15 inches long, but it was hard to tell with all the leaves, unevenness, grass, etc. I took photos and measurements (even on a walk I take a camera and tape measure). <BR><BR>It was interesting as hiding by that tree the Futures Trail went right past the tree, above was the power line and behind the tree was the park road, so that it was an advantageous hunting spot as animals coming from six different directions could easily be hunted down.<BR><BR>Going back to the car, I saw two more tracks to the right of the trail. One was about 10 inches. The other seemed to be 15 inches, but with a 10 inch track inside it. The toes were 5 inches across for the three toes that were embedded in the bank. The other toes were over the hardened trail. There was also a 5x6 inch parallelogram shape. I kick myself now as I didn''t take a photo. <BR><BR>Later I saw a knuckle-walking gorilla on TV and thought, \"That''s what that was!\" It was a knuckle print and also was very deep. <BR><BR>At the bottom I asked the ranger to do a casting and he said I could instead, so I bought plaster of Paris. It wasn''t enough. I had to go back several days later (rain). <BR><BR>The casts are awful. There were too many leaves, the toes broke off, etc. <BR><BR>The interesting part was that the park ranger acknowledged the report with a \"Yeah, we get lots of reports of bigfoots, but we try to keep it on the down low.\" <BR><BR>When I asked him about mountain lion sightings, he seemed scared and said, \"You think there are mountain lions up there?\"<BR>It was odd that bigfoot was \"normal\" and mountain lions were \"strange\"!<BR><BR>When I came back, I heard from someone else that this same ranger had been followed down the hill by something he nicknamed Roy. He was hoping it was a bigfoot and not a lion. Part of his job is to clear the trails and make sure everyone is off the mountain. That night it got dark, and he was also \"helped\" off the mountain, though \"it\" always stayed the same distance behind him.",

I wanted to be sure I had not imagined it.<BR><BR>Very quickly she said, \"I don''t know what it was but it was real big, maybe eight feet tall, hairy and crossed the road in two steps.\"<BR><BR>She saw the same thing I did.

    " Nov. 1984 between 12:00& 1:00AM The night my niece was born.There was a snow storm, my brother-in-law had a custom car and wanted to go home to milton to switch to his older car because of the sudden snow. My husband, brother-in-law, nephew 3yrs old & myself, drove from milton, we were headed to my house in Winooski. we got as far as Clochester when the snow got real bad and the car slid into a ditch,my newphew began to cry&scream, so we flaged down a truck to bring me&my nephew to my house to call a tow truck. I Left my husband&BROTHER-IN-LAW in Colchester. My husband said while they were waiting they started to hear noises in the woods, like trees breaking,than they heard something that was coming in thier dirction but the it was stomping on two legs they could breaking trees,coming closer,my husband is a hunter and he said you could tell it was walking on two legs they backed away from the side of the road to the other, couldnt run because the road was to slippery <BR>and they only had on sneakers. meanwhile it kept on getting closer, it was starting to part the trees when the tow truck came and they heard it running back into the woods breaking every thing in its path My husband was very scared , they both were &told me what had happened. I HALF believed them.<BR>The next day I drove threw the same place & looked around as I drove I saw fields and woods and thought that it looked to peaceful and really thought they were nuts. I HAD TO PICK UP MY HUSBAND IN MILTON. I had my daughters with me 10 and 13, I WAS PREGNANT at that time, anyway I got to Milton ,latter that night we headed back to Winooski, well wouldnt you know it, it started to snow realy hard like the night before and it was 12:00am. <BR><BR>We started to go threw the same spot as the night before and I started to tell my husband about me looking around earlier and that there was nothing ...... When there it was, it just crossed the road and started to go up a hill ,it was staring at us with one  foot on a wire fence holding the wire down with its arm and just staring at us, it was not brown but white with yellow dirty streaks and his eyes, oh how they scared me, they were reflecting a yellow/amber color  like the yellow on causion lights, huge man, it was at least 10 ft. tall arms very long ,his fur was long, on his face the only flesh part that didnt have fur was his eyes,upper cheeks. My husband started to slow down to get a better look, thats when I freaked out and started to hit my husband because I was so scared & my girls were screaming so we kept on going I just kept on thinking about its eyes and was afraid so we wandered if they know its there and we dont want to get shot looking. <BR>",

We have had a bear here by the deck, so I know what bears look like standing up to the reach feeder. <BR><BR>It was sunny day. My small Chihuahua mix was out front in her cage. She was barking so I walked out to front deck and looked towards dirt road where she was looking. We sit back approx.125ft from the road. <BR><BR>I saw a very black humanoid shape walking on two legs go past our driveway. It was half bent over then straightened up. It had  longs arms swinging. The head was turned away & appeared to have very short neck & roundish head from that angle. <BR><BR>I said to myself, \"That looks like a chimp!\". I watched for it for approx.12 seconds until it disappeared behind trees going east on road.  There are spots that I can see thru the trees to the neighbors drive, so I was looking for it to either go up the drive or continue on road. When it did not, I walked out to end of drive, approx. 200 ft. ( w/ my air horn). There was nothing on the road for some distance.<BR><BR>Later in day I went out to that area with my small dog. She refused to even walk and was trembling. This is the same dog that almost went thru a screen door to attack the bear by our feeder a few weeks ago. I noticed an area of bent weeds that would have been where the creature had exited our woods, going into a small ditch then back up to get onto road before walking past our drive. On the roadside, in the direction I saw it going,  there were 3 barefoot heel depressions w/ faint toe marks approx. 12 inches long.  The area was dry with fine gravel so not a clear print.<BR><BR>The week before, I had heard twigs snapping & weeds moving behind my fenced garden. This approx. 40 ft from the front porch where I often sit. The dog barked. The noise stopped then started again, so I fired off my air horn which I always have near after an encouter with a large coy-wolf.<BR><BR>The cabin sits about 100ft  above the N.

    "There was a time when I was delivering newspapers very early in the morning. I took a shortcut down a path through some woods and I could barely see anything. I came around a corner in the path and got scared because I saw what I thought was some large dark person laying down next to the path taking a rest and looking at me. I could not discern any features and could not tell if it was a log or a person, but something made me stop and stare. I kept blinking trying to get the nerve to get closer, but I could not see clearly enough. I went back the way I came. Since this was a path I used regularly I couldn''t remember if a log was there or what that could have been. This might not be worth mentioning.",

    " My friend and I were out late on a saturday night visiting some girls.  We didn''t have a car and we had walked about 7 or 8 miles to arrive.  We were both on the JV soccer team at our highschool and even though the season was over we were in very good shape.  For this reason we jogged maybe half the trip which got us there in time for saturday night live.  We stayed long enough for me to watch SNL with one girl and my friend to spend some private time with his beau.  It got to be late and we knew we had a long trip back to his place.<BR><BR>I felt fine and wanted to leave after awkwardly watching TV with this girl.  Getting to this location was easy because it was mostly downhill, but getting back was going to take longer. We were still in good shape so we jogged most of the way back up the long hill on Town Hill Rd.(219) near Bakersville, but in New Hartford, CT.<BR><BR>It was a crisp night without much moonlight. We had grown comfortable jogging side by side in the middle of the road.  Since it was so late nobody was out driving and we set a consistent pace for about 2 hours.  We finally made it to the top of the long hill where Route 219 flattens out.  We were casually jogging in the middle of the road past houses and an occasional farm when we heard a bad sound.<BR><BR>It made us stop dead in our tracks and we were both frightened.  It came from the left of the road perhaps behind a farm and a fair distance away.  I distinctly remember turning my head as the sound swept from left to right and thinking to myself that is a big sound.<BR><BR>I would like to comment on the sound.  I have spent alot of time in the woods of Connecticut and was familiar with sounds from area wildlife including birds, squirrels, coyotes, dogs etc.  I immediately asked my friend \"What the f!$# was that?\"  He responded that he did not know.  From the left, the sound was a cry that sounded like a cross between a baby and a woman screaming bloody murder that started very high, held for a number of seconds, and then came down in pitch.  When it got lower it changed into a broken cackle that made the echoes more pronounced.  It was very disturbing and unlike anything we had ever heard.  I asked my friend if he wanted to stay and check it out but he was very disturbed and did not want to hang around.  It was a bad sound that you don''t want to hear in the middle of night.  We stood there for a few moments confused and scared, and decided to get going.<BR><BR>We continued jogging for another hour discussing along the way what it could be.  Eventually we became more relaxed and the conversation moved onto other things like the events earlier in the evening.  Things were fine again and we were making good progress over a few more miles when we heard the sound again, this time on the right side of the road and closer.<BR><BR>Again it was a blood curdling scream that held for a few seconds, slowly descended in pitch and cackled at the end, but on the other side of the road and closer.  We were now more scared and both had the feeling we were being followed or tracked.    I turned to my friend and said pointedly that we might not get another chance like this again and I grabbed his arm.  In panic he cocked his right arm back and said some expletives to the extent that if I did not let go he would lay me out flat right there.  He sprinted down the road without me and I had no choice but to follow him since I lost sight of him in the dark.  I caught up with him soon enough and we quietly jogged the remainder of the distance to his house though we were shaky.<BR><BR>For years he was not open to talking about what we heard and he apologized for threatening me and leaving me standing there.  When it was discussed we never came to a decision about what it was.<BR><BR>A few years ago I came across the BFRO website and started reading reports.  I listened to a few audio recordings from OHIO but nothing clicked until I read reports of screams.  The recordings on the site are like moans and long whoops, but some reports describe a more stressed vocalization that puts the listeners instantly into panic- this is what we heard.  Its a really really bad sound that is confusing because it sounds sort of familiar, but is so extreme its difficult to describe.  The reports I have read that describe the scream include hunters and military folks who pretty much bolt when they hear it.<BR><BR>Since this happened I have worked professionally in molecular genetics and neurobiology at UCONN and Yale University.  I have also had careers in the financial industry as a quantitative analyst, and as a sound designer and audio engineer to the musical instrument industry.<BR><BR>Whatever made the sound was able to project over a great distance, and kept up with us over enough miles to convince us we were being stalked.  I cannot say for sure what made the sound, but based on: other credible reports in the BFRO database, the similarity to other screams and our own responses, a sasquatch is my best candidate without invoking the supernatural which I personally would never do.<BR><BR>Looking in the database for reports from Connecticut, the only one I found was surprisingly in the same County - Litchfield.",

    "   This sighting happened when I was a young boy of about seven or eight years of age. It was a cloudy fall day. I was playing near a window in a second story farm house when something caught my eye. I watched as a hairy nine-foot creature walked up hill across the front yard. It had a huge stride, as if it were in a hurry. It kept looking back as it walked with its long swinging arms. When it turned its head it had to also turn its shoulders to be able to look at a 90-degree angle. I stood watching it walk along when it apeared to look up and make eye contact with me for only a second. It never broke its stride. It''s eyes glowed like a raccoon or a cat at night when light is shined in their eyes. What frightened me was that it was still daylight. I didn''t get really freaked until it disapeared around the side of the house. That''s when I ran in to the kitchen were my parents were playing cards with another couple. I tried to get their attention but they didn''t have time for a whiny kid who wanted a cookie or candy. It wasn''t until they escorted me out the front door and slammed it in my face that they figured out something was wrong: There was no way I was going to hang around out side with a monster in the area. I flipped out --screaming, beating,kicking the door  and crying for them to let me in. It was only a couple or three seconds and they knew something was terrible wrong. They let me in and I explained what I had just seen through tears. My father and his friend went outside to look around, probably thinking they would find a loose cow. I''ll never forget the look on their faces when they saw the foot prints that dwarfed their own. My dad''s friend was a tall man of around six foot two or three. When he stretched his legs to step from one foot print to another it was next to impossible. Their disbelief had turned to fear. They did however want to follow the tracks that went across a field that had been plowed recently. I freaked out again. They seemed to understand this time. They decided that going in a car would be better. We drove down a road a short distance, found were it crossed and went on up a hill. The tracks disapeared and that seemed fine with everyone.  ",

    " There is a small pond located in the wildlife management area in Harwinton. I have frequently visited this place throughout my youth, and adulthood to fish, camp, hike, bike, and hunt.<BR>The pond is spring fed, and is located in a flood conroll area. A town built dam at one end helps contoll the water level, but at the time of the incident the dam was poorly built.<BR>In late summer the water level in the pond would drop drastically, and create a higher concenration of fish. The best time to go fishing was at night when temps. were cooler.<BR>On this one particular night I decided to go moonlight topwater bassi''n alone. I parked my car at the entance gate around 9:00pm, and proceeded on foot down the service road. The moonlight was intense, and afforded me the luxury of saving my flashlight batteries for most of the treck. The trip from the road to the pond is approx. 3/4 of a mile, and takes you through several fields wich are cut in the summer.On the way i startled some deer that were around a salt lick, they ran off in the opposite direction of the pond.<BR>I walked through the final field, and over a stone wall, onto a path that leads directly to the spot on the pond where i wanted to fish.The area from the stone wall to the pond is wooded, and recquired use of the flashlight.<BR>The path, and woodline end in an area of land that juts out into the pond, forming a point. Due to the low water level, it was another 50 yds. walk to get to the waters edge. I fished off of a couple of rocks that jutted out even further.<BR>I had been fishing for approximately an hour, and havig some luck. The moon was full, and almost directly overhead. I was out in the wide open, and could see very well all around the shoreline. The woodline around the pond was spaced from the water at least 30yards plus in all directions. The moonlight did not penetrate into the woods, and so I could not see into them. I felt as though I were on center stage to anything that might be in the woods wathing me. All of a sudden out of nowhere a loud and deep sound eminated direclty from the woodline where I had entered the area. My knees went weak, and I nearly fell off the rocks. I turned to face the area in a ducking position trying to see what it was. The sound was again repeated after a short pause, and then nothin. I pointed my flashlight in the direction of the sound,but it was too far and too weak, not even an eyeshine. This was all that I heard.<BR>The sounds were as follows: WWRRUUMMMPFSFSFSFSSS!!-twice in succession, then a short pause (10 sec.) followed by the same WWRRUUMMMPFSFSFSSS!!-Twice in succession.<BR>The sounds were deep, and came from something large, (200+lbs.) They echoed across the pond! They were definitely directed at me, something was letting me know it was there.<BR>I found it odd that pryor to and after, there were no sounds of walking in the woods. Watever this was made a stealthy approach, and exit. I never heard anything again.<BR>I stayed and fished nervously for another hour, and left the area scared but without incident.<BR> <BR>",

    " I have a couple of incidents to report, both took place near Bethel, CT at the property I owned/lived on at the time. <BR><BR>These incidents took place in May of 2013 if I recall correctly. I lived set back in the woods up a long driveway not completely surrounded by forest but mostly. There were a couple houses a hundred or more feet away but I was pretty isolated. <BR><BR>I pulled up to my house in front of my garage. I was facing a small chunk of woods behind an old stone wall that was very brushy and bushy and had a lot of big rocks and uneven ground and it all went slightly up hill. I got out of the car with my 4 and a half month old German Shepherd and she uncharacteristically ran away from me toward the aforementioned stone wall barking very aggressively like a full grown Shepherd in protection mode. I was curious what sort of creature could get her to react like that so I took my flashlight out of the car and shined it in the brush but it was so heavy all I could see was a dark shadow moving about 20 ft or so ahead of me very slowly, sounding almost bipedal, like it wasn''t very afraid but was keeping its distance. Finally it got to somewhat of a clearing but was crouching and hiding behind a tree poking its head out from behind repeatedly. <BR><BR>I wondered what dark bulky figure could have bright reddish orange eyes and move from crouching to standing relatively tall so I initially figured it must have been a black bear and I called my dog inside and went about my business. <BR><BR>The very next night I pulled into the same spot and I had a friend with me and we got out of the car and we both heard a large bellowing roar a couple times and it sounded like it was in the area I saw the \"bear\" the night before. He asked me \"what the f--- is that\" and I said it must have been what I assumed was the bear I encountered the night before. It wasn''t until a few months later when I was watching some videos on sasquatch encounters did I realize what I really saw. Not only that but black bears don''t roar. The roar I heard sounded like vocalization recordings of angry sasquatch and the movements of the head and color of the eyes were exactly as anyone who encountered them had reported. <BR><BR> According to another sasquatch reporting site there was a sighting in the late 70s in the town next to Bethel (Danbury) and a cast was taken of prints. <BR><BR>I firmly believe it was a sasquatch I encountered.",

    " This sighting happened in mid October 1971 in Fairfield, New Jersey.  It was a Saturday, sometime around noon.  <BR><BR>At the time I was 15 and my friend was 16.  We were walking throught a area that is primarily brushy woods, but alot of wet land with only clumps of  tall grass. We were walking in a westerly direction along a feeder stream that fed into the Passic River.  The Passic River is about 1/2 mile north of where we were. The area is quite flat.  The areas on the imediate left and right of the feeder stream had little brush.                <BR><BR>It was partly cloudy, and we were wearing light jackets.  From a distance of aproximetly 75 yards we observed 4 creatures.  The largest was standing on the south side of the stream.  It appeared to be about 8 feet tall, very long arms that went almost to the knees.  Very powerfully built, barrel chested, very wide shoulders.  the head seemed to have a rounded \"peak\".  The color of all 4 was black, the faces seemed somewhat lighter in color, but not white.  The second one was sitting on the ground, the third was lying on the stream bank, and the last was standing in the middle of the stream.  <BR><BR>We observed them for a few minutes.  They also observed us.  We discussed it and decided to run.  We ran back east for a bit until we came to a clear cut for power lines that ran north & south.  We ran south along the clear cut for aproximetly 1/4 mile until we came to Route 80.  <BR><BR>We went home.  The only people we told were our parents.  At no time did we feel threatened by the creatures.  We were used to being in the woods and knew the local fauna.  We both agreed these were not people or bears.

    " April 29 2006 about 630pm I just left the Livingston mall and was heading home but got all turned about since I don''t go up that way very often. Anyhow I was figuring that I was north of rt 78 and just kind of \"Lewis and Clarked\" it toward home via the mirror compass in my car and made the first left southbound that I could once I realized I was heading west and didn''t recognize any landmarks. <BR><BR>I turn down this road and notice some construction equipment not far off into the trees on the right side of the road. I was driving slower than normal being unfarmiliar with the area and since I kept peeking at the compass to make sure I was still southbound (looking back it must have been overcast since I would have just used the location of the sun as a reference to direction).<BR>As I was driving along I caught movement out of the corner of my eye and saw a young deer (judging by size) bolt out of the trees across the road from left to right about 100-200 feet in front of my car. I just took my foot off the gas and didn''t need to brake, then I looked left for followers and saw what appeard to be a hunter in a dark colored ghillie suit burst from the trees after the deer. I couldnt make out any details of the face feet or hands but he/it was only around 6 feet tall or so and I''d estimate the low 200lb range but was unusually fast especially for someone dressed like that. The second thought in my head since I fish and shoot a bit was that it couldn''t possibly be legal to hunt around that area since its fairly close to residential zones. Then I noticed that the hunter had no weapons in his hands. I got up to the spot where they crossed and looked right and noticed that the biped (hunter) actually closed ground on the deer and was still in pursuit. I don''t know if the deer stopped to look back at some point as they some times do but this thing was in a full tilt sprint over what I would assume to be uneven ground and didn''t stumble once. I didn''t hear or smell anything since I had my roof up and AC & radio on at the time. All of this happened I would estimate in less than 20 seconds total.",

    " I''m reporting this approximately 10 years after the fact.  My wife had asked me to re-tell my story to her this morning and that is what prompted us to stumble across this web site.  <BR><BR>Late Fall 1997 (or possibly 1996).  I was coming out of my apartment''s laundry facility, which is a seperate building not connected to the actual apartment buildings.  I must have heard something because I looked to my right and there it was, about 20 feet away.  The creture was about 5.5 to 6 feet tall. I''d guess it was aroung 200 lbs. There was no odor and it made no sound.  I saw it as it was rooting through a garbage dumpster.  In a matter of seconds my brain went through a kind of checklist to try to rationalize what I was seeing.  But it was not a bear, it was too slim in relation to its height.  It also moved in a way that was very human.  It was nighttime but there was a parking lot light on overhead.  I could see hair that was brown and about 4-7 inches in length. Unfortunately, primative survival instict and adreneline took over.  I bolted toward my apartment, running so fast that I lost my footing as I was going through a dip in the terrain.  I landed arms first and slid across a gravel covered road.  As I got to my feet I looked over my shoulder to see that it too had run and was about 200 feet from where we had met.<BR><BR>I''m certain it was not an animal that is commonly known to people.  It was humanoid in appearence and movement.  The way it stopped what it was doing, turned its head and looked at me was freaky. Because of shadows I couldn''t get a look at its face.  The incident didn''t change my life or anything.  I hardly ever think about it...unless I look at my elbow.  I scraped it really bad when I fell running, and have a scar to this day.  When I first told this story to my wife she was very taken aback because she knows that I am a very rational and analytic person.  ",

    " On April 15, 2011 my sons and I were camping at Mahlon Dickerson Reservation near Jefferson Township, NJ. The temperature was approximately 52 degrees and the day was overcast. At around 3 PM the three of us struck out from our campsite directly into the timber. There was no overgrowth and the trees were still bare. This is the reason we didnt take any of the marked trails in the area. The terrain is very rocky and over the next hour we hiked and climbed. Circling back into the camp area we emerged at the far end and headed toward the road that runs the length of the campsite.<BR><BR>From our position on the road, immediately to our right would be the beginning of a two-way trail. The lower trail heads off and skirts the bottom of the mountain while the upper trail heads up it. As we got to the road I looked over my right shoulder (Why I did this I still do not know. In other words, there was no noise that I heard or any other reason I can think of that made me turn around). There, at the beginning of the upper trail was a tall bulky black figure. It moved from right to left. Its arms were long and swung in large motions as it walked. The head was dome shaped and very close to the shoulders. In fact, it seemed that it would have had to turn its entire body to look in any direction other than straight ahead.  It walked out of site rather quickly. <BR><BR>I was completely caught off guard when I saw it. My very first thought was why is this guy walking up the trail wearing black from head to toe? Thats when it hit me that no one would. Sure there are hikers and mountain bikers on the trails but not at this time of year during a work day. In fact, we had spent the previous night here and were the only campers on the grounds. There had been no visitors to the grounds the entire day save one woman who came to walk her small dog. The next thought that ran through my mind was how big it was. It did not appear to be exceptionally tall (not eight feet tall anyway) but the sheer girth of the thing was impressive. It seemed to me that it could have wrestled a bear and easily won. <BR><BR>I have to admit that it took me a few seconds to gather my wits once it had moved out of sight. Once I did I told the boys to stay behind me and we moved up to where I had seen it. Once we reached the area I looked to the right where I had first seen it come into view and got another small surprise. I had thought it was walking along the upper trail when I first spotted it. However, that trail began where I had first seen it. The direction it came from was an off trail wooded area. We did follow the trail for about ten minutes but I decided to abandon it and head back to camp when the kids got spooked. On the way back I had my 12 year old, 155lbs, 56 son stand at the top of the trail where I had first seen the thing while I went back to my original spot where I first saw it. Whatever I saw that day was an easy 12 taller and three times bigger around than my son. <BR><BR>Those are the facts. Now, I have to add that my impression of this thing was one of curiosity. I had been having a feeling, not an overwhelming feeling but a feeling none the less, that as we hiked off trail that day we were being watched. I never felt threatened or perceived any danger or I certainly would have moved my boys right out of there. It seems to me that it had been watching us and once we had left its area and gotten back to ours it was more than happy to move on its way. <BR><BR>",

Took one step from the center of my lane and with one step, not a run, was over the sideline and into the woods. I was about 19 at the time. No one believes me to this day.

    " We were at Octoberfest in October 1998 at Great Gorge in Vernon NJ.  We were out on the back deck which boarders the mountains and the golf course.  My brother in law and sister with me.  Out of the corner of my eye I saw an approximately 7 1/2 - 8 foot large figure that walked with a long steady gate,  with long arms and a thick chest.  It walked steadily down the mountain side glancing at us and continuing to walk.  We all looked at each other before running inside.  We all saw the exact same thing.  ",

    " I had some strange experiences in my childhood. A friend from up the street, she and I would walk through the woods. There was a path that went in a big circle where the older neighborhood kids would ride dirt bikes. It was about a mile around, I''d say. When we''d get about 2/3 the way around this ''circle'' we''d hear single short whistles and small stones would be tossed near us. We thought it was the neighborhood kids, so kind of ignored it, but this would happen every time we walked around in this section of the woods. About 3/4 the way around the circle, we saw some matted down dry grass, that looked like a bedding area. Also, some strange footprints as well in the muddy areas. They were huge footprints and the toes seemed almost rectangular in the dried footprints. We''d also smell a wet dog type smell in this area. The last time I was in that section of the woods was 1975/1976. <BR><BR>A couple other times, I''d go with a friend to the Howell/Farmingdale area. We''d walk back to an abandoned house in the woods and drink a couple beers. We''d hear noises and saw some of the same size footprints that the neighbor and I had seen in the woods behind my neighborhood. <BR><BR>Fast forward 5 years or so, a boyfriend and I were smoking cigarettes in the school field by the house I grew up in. It was Fall, just at dusk, probably 6pm-ish. I happened to look up and look across the school field and saw this HUGE shadow standing on a slightly raised hill across the school field, by another neighborhood...I stared at that figure for a minute thinking that person sure has long arms, It was probably 60 feet away from us at that time. I stared a minute more and suddenly I could see that figure crystal clear as it bolted across the school field towards us. As it got closer I could see reddish brown shaggy fur on this huge man/ape type creature. It ran towards us silently, but with huge strides, as it came closer and closer. All I could do was yell, \"RUN!\" and we ran through a neighbor''s yard and back to my house. I told my mom what happened and she said we shouldn''t have been in the school field when it was getting dark...I was petrified and the next day my boyfriend and one of his friends went back to look for this thing, but we never found it again. I recently talked to my son about this incident and wrote it out for him, as I wanted my story documented. I still to this day get goosebumps every time I talk about it. ",

    " First I want it to be clear that I am very skeptical that what I witnessed was anything out of the ordinary. I say this for reasons I will explain in a moment. Nonetheless, I am reporting this incident because even though I am skeptical, it remains possible that I did observe something extraordinary and if that is so then perhaps others did or will. So I offer this report as a possible sighting and to hopefully corroborate any other reports that you may receive involving the same area. Any such additional reports would of course then lend more credence to mine.<BR><BR>Also I would like to indicate that I firmly believe in the existence of sasquatch and have had an ardent interest in this mystery since I was around 12. My interest was reinvigorated a year or so ago when I found the BFRO website. I  grew up in the northwest portion of New Jersey, which is an area of predominately deciduous forest with sporadic coniferous areas as well. There are open pastures as well as rugged mountainous terrain there.   An example   being the Kittatinny Ridge that runs through Sussex County and contains a portion of the Appalachian Trail. So while I don''t believe this area offers the optimal environmental characteristics to sustain or attract a constant sasquatch population, I do think (as with many other species) that a transient sasquatch may very well wander into this area periodically (from areas west or north) and perhaps remain for an extended period of time. I think the reports of sightings from this area over the last 30 years or so pretty much indicate this type of pattern. <BR><BR>So ever since my renewed interest began, I have made a point of being much more observant of my surroundings especially when driving through those types of areas I mentioned above. I should also note that I am in law enforcement and I have a keen interest in most matters of science. I accept the need for a scientific approach to investigating this and other type of phenomena and that belief is what has instilled part of the skepticism of my \"sighting\". That and the fact that my incident provides minimal information from an investigatory stand point. Also, while I indicated earlier that I felt the terrain and environment of this area could offer refuge to a transient creature, the amount of development and activity, especially where my incident occurred says otherwise. But with that said, here''s what I saw.<BR><BR> On this day I was really attempting to look beyond the road edge and peer into the woods or fields as I drove past. <BR>There is a small creek (Burnt Meadow Brook)that runs perpendicular from the roadway into that area. As I looked back about 200-250 yards or so I observed what seemed to be a human like shape standing and appearing to be looking down either at the ground or into the water (I couldn''t tell from my vantage point). It was dark brown to black in color and for the short 4-5 seconds I observed it there was no apparent movement. My best guess would be that it was between six and seven feet in height. My perception was that this \"thing\" was facing opposite of my direction of travel and that I was viewing its right side. The distance was too great to observe any fine detail or to even determine if it wasn''t just an old tree trunk.  However, upon passing that location on subsequent days, it was no longer present. It''s possible that it was a person, but I am pretty confident it was not based on the appearance and the relative inaccessibility of the location. Due to the distance, I was basically looking at a silhouette and thus unable to note any specific anatomical features. <BR><BR>I questioned the probability of a sasquatch venturing into this particular area considering it was during daylight hours and the location is right off a major interstate and this occurred during the peak of the morning rush. Also, the area I described is on the south side of the highway, perhaps 300-400 yards from the edge of a large commercial/retail/residential area. I should note however, that the area on the opposite (north) side of the road is predominately woods and is basically the southern edge of Green Pond Mountain which, being sparsely inhabited and heavily wooded, could offer a person or animal the ability to travel northward and westward for miles unseen. This tract of forested, relatively undeveloped land extends continuously into Pennsylvania and New York State. So I guess my implication is that if this was an animal, it most likely approached from the north side.  I have since noticed that there is a drainage culvert (to accommodate the creek mentioned earlier) which appears to run under the highway connecting the north and south sides. I do not know the diameter of this culvert however. <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>",
    :environment
    "Approaching the location, there is a small wooded tract which ends at the edge of a marshy, wetlands area. A small creek (Burnt Meadow Brook)runs through it which consists of marsh type grass, low brush and some sporadic trees. Continuing east the area remains wetlands with a predominance of tall reeds before transitioning back to a wooded terrain. The entire marsh area is perhaps 200-250 yards wide and perhaps 1/4 mile deep before ending at the commercial area.",

    " My friend and I wanted to go fishing at bear pond so we left my house at about 6 pm. We went topwater fishing because of the approaching sunset. We went in a canoe and fished along the edge of the entire pond.  It started to get too dark to cast accurately considering all of the trees along the edge overhang the water. We decided to start heading to the docking area to go home. By now it was completely dark and there are no houses in the back part of the pond just woods and rivers and some preety steep hills that go on forever.We were at a complete stop in the canoe between the mainland and an island when all of a sudden we both heard a loud scream comming from the mainland up on a hill. It sounded like a mix between a young girl screaming and a weard bird like sound.We both looked at each other and said \"What the hell was that\".Again it happened and again. Just as the sound stopped something started to RUN in the mainland woods about 50 yards from us.The sound was very loud like crashing and running. <BR><BR>Something was watching us very quietly because we had passed that area along the edge of the water about 20 minutes earlier.  Anyway, this thing was definitely on two legs running towards the screaming sound on the hill. It must have ran 100 feet in 7 seconds. I must tell you that there was a new moon that night so it was pitch black out. When the thing was running it broke sticks and branches and was very loud almost running urgently and clumsily. At that point it stopped completely by the screaming sound we heard seconds ago. My friend and I both sat there stunned in the canoe; our eyes looking toward the direction of where the running stopped. We sat there for almost an hour listening but we only heard small twigs breaking nothing else. We eventually left but we both know what it was. <BR><BR>We are both in our mid 20''s and are avid outdoorsman and know that whatever we heard was not a bear or deer.",

    " NJ:2AM/;Summer morning:1977:Owassa Rd:Sussex Cty<BR><BR>While traveling back from the Dover Station and returning to Camp Kiamesha a group of counselors encountered a large creature as it crossed the road in about 3 steps, it stood about 7 feet tall and as it crossed the road, it turned and our headlights caught its shape and eyes. It had crossed between us and another car, it was at least 3 foot higher than the car in front of us.<BR><BR>From the low area to the left to the mountain area on the right. I was driving that van, I slammed on the brakes and asked everyone if they saw what I had seen, they did. I then got out with a flash light and another friend to investigate. The ground on the right where it had gone into was loose dirt and rocky area but no foot prints were found and the creature was gone. We waited there for some time, even stopped a car traveling in the same direction for help, but they only stayed long enough for us to say what we had seen and sped off.<BR><BR>When we reached the camp we called the NJ State Police to report our find, but they wouldn''t believe us.<BR><BR>In March of 1978 I led a BF hunt on Mount Paradise near Crandon Lake and found footprints in the snow.<BR><BR>Its been 34 years since this incident and it still seems like yesterday.

    " My brother and I camped overnight in High Point State Park, New Jersey, the other night. Driving around the park, the camping sites were labeled with numbers. We wanted to set up in a place as far away as we could from the other people. I myself, have known the existence of Sasquatch to be real for quite some time. Not from a personal experience which was yet to come, but because of watching so many people tell their stories of encounters, and just seeing the genuine fright and truthfulness in their eyes when they tell their stories. My brother however, always laughed at the subject of Bigfoot, and was a complete skeptic. So, my brother and I has set up camp on the edge of what I''m assuming was the only lake in the park. We walked through the forest in the daytime, and indeed found many peculiar structures and tree breaks I had seen before on Bigfoot TV shows. As night fell, we made a fire, and watched the numerous stars reveal themselves as the night got darker. Around 12 o''clock at night I went over to a rock right by the edge of the lake and looked up at the stars, while my brother tended the fire. I''m an astronomy fan, so before I knew it I had been sitting there for two hours when I checked my phone and it said it was nearing 2 in the morning. Just then my phone ran out of battery. While sitting on the rock, I began to feel a weird sensation that someone or something was watching me, I checked to see if it was my brother but he was staring into the fire. I dismissed this feeling and told myself I had just brought it on myself. I looked back up at the stars and got lost in some train of thought when all of the sudden, something made a very loud noise that could only be described as a very large man exhaling aggressively towards me. I jumped up and ran to my brother, and we heard the thing walk towards the forest, all the while breaking branches and continuing to make the same aggressive noise I heard so close to me. It got quiet, and my brother and I were standing looking in the direction where all the noise had came from when it made the noise again. Now, I don''t speak Sasquatch but that thing was telling us to get the heck out of there. I don''t get scared easily at all, and I was shaking like I never had before. I felt so much negative energy and decided I was too scared to stay outside, so we went to the car and sat inside, praying whatever made that noise didn''t come back. My brother described the sound as sounding like someone ripping a tent. Whatever the noise was, absolutely no common animal could have made it. After a sleepless night, when it got light out again around 5:30, we built up the courage to go back where we heard the noise to see if there were any indications of what made it. And when we got there, I was shocked. There was a makeshift bed made from giant leaves that was fit for a very large creature. I could see the exact spot where the thing that had made the noise was watching me, and where it walked away, as there was a clear path of flattened grass and plants leading up the forest. The area was wet and muddy, and indeed there were footprints. But, as I was taking pictures the path leading from the bed to the upper forest, it happened again. The thing made the same exact noise, this time it was so close, I nearly fell. We ran back to our campsite and listened. But nothing made a sound. We stayed there for about 30 minutes until I decided to go back and see if there were fresh prints or anything I could take back as proof. I took more pictures, and i was standing on the trail leading back to our campsite looking at the pictures I had taken when again, the thing made the same noise! This time it was on the side of me that I would have to run past it to get back to the campsite. As soon as I heard it, it felt like my heart literally dropped and my legs became wobbly, but I summed up my courage and once again ran back to the campsite in fear. It was only about 10 seconds away, and when I got there my brother was standing there wide eyed asking if I had heard the noise. Whatever it was, it was not happy and we heard it walk up into the forest breaking branches and exhaling aggressively as it headed deeper into the forest. At this point my brother wanted to get the heck out of there, but I needed to see it. I went up to the road right before the forest where we had heard it go in, and looked around, but saw nothing. I was so confused on how the heck it ever got so close to me without me seeing or hearing it walk at all. While I was walking on the road, I saw my brother walk up from the campsite looking around. When he spotted me, he sighed in relief and told me he though I was getting attacked because he heard a bunch of human like screams coming from the forest. I walked towards where he was and started to hear them too, but by the time I reached him the screams started to sound like some kind of weird chatter. My brother, the skeptic, was so scared he told me were packing up and leaving right away. I have no doubt in my mind that we just happened to pick a campsite right next to where a Sasquatch was sleeping, and he was just not happy about that. I know what we heard was a Sasquatch. My brother entered a skeptic, but left a full believer in Bigfoot. ",

When I got back in my car, I noticed someone standing behind the very high brush, 7-8 feet tall at least because I could see its complete head over the bushes. It just stood there watching us. Reddish-brown, orangutan colored hair, covered it''s head. It was very human-like and I could tell that it was standing upright. I blinked a million times to try and really focus as much as I could, paying attention to detail. I couldn''t make out the face for certain as it was covered in hair. When we started to drive, it immediately took off in the opposite direction as to not confront us. It seemed to be frightened. At this point I said out loud, WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT?

We were heading towards the hawk lookout when I began to hear what sounded like wood knocks coming from behind us to the east. I decided to knock back to see what would happen. I had my Panasonic Digital IC recorder model RR-US360 with me. I knocked while my wife recorded. This happened at approximately 1:30 PM in the afternoon. I have been hiking this area for a few months now and have come across some interesting stick structures. I later found out from a neighbor that lived in the area his entire life that there are caves and mines on the side where the knocks were coming from. Could it be Sasquatch? I do not know for sure, but I cannot think of anything else making these wood knocks and stick structures.",

It got very interesting when I started sprinting, it also started sprinting keeping up with me for what seemed like at least a mile. When I would walk, it would walk. It was loud as it went thru the woods as I stayed on the road hoping for a car to pick me up.

I started to fix the tape again when my buddy said \"what the hell is that\" I looked up to see a very large gray haired creature stepping out of the bushes.

    " My husband and I were taking a woods cruise and were driving in the northern section of Brendan T. Byrne Forest on St Mary''s road. It came to a dead end so we stopped to look around and there was a pond and a little path so we decided to walk our dog for a bit. We had only gone in a little ways when we smelled kind of musty mildew odor typically not smelled in the woods. This kind of freaked my husband out and he wanted to go back to the car. So we started back the way we came and then turned down Buckingham Whiting road. We drove this for a bit and came across a little bridge. We stopped because I like taking pictures of the water. After a bit we started to drive off. I am driving and in a split second I saw something brown on 2 legs and about 6 feet tall sprint behind the car in the area we were just in. I caught it in my rear view mirror. I was kind of thinking to myself that my eyes were playing tricks on me but I just couldn''t shake it. I stopped the car and husband told me to go in reverse. As we approached the area he thought he heard branches snapping and a splash into the water. He didn''t see anything so we drove on. We just kept talking about what I saw and if it was a bear a deer a person. I said it was definitely on 2 legs. It was quick and it was light brown but thin. We drove a little more and turned around and went back. On our way back I thought something was rubbing in my brakes because we heard like a wuh wuh wuh wuh wuh - we stopped and he looked under my car and didn''t see anything. He thought maybe it was what I saw making a warning call. ",

    " Being an avid outdoors man and interested in various types of wildlife since childhood, I''ve had my share of camping, canoeing, hunting, fishing, finding Native American artifacts, and hiking, etc.  On one particular sunny spring day during 2011, I decided to walk some trails adjacent to Brendan T. Byrne St. Forest opposite Rt. 70.  On one side of the sandy/gravel trail is a pine forest, on the other a downward slope into a densely wooded swampy area where a stream flows.  At one point a few yards into the swampy area, I heard an unrecognized sound similar to a cross between a bird call and a whistle type noise at which I stopped dead in my tracks in attempt to see what made this unusual sound, but saw nothing. Within a few seconds just to the side of this noise I heard the smashing and crashing of large wet logs on a level the likes of which I have never heard before.  This ruckus appeared to be purposeful in origin as if the creature was attempting to make as much noise as it possibly could...And it was succeeding!  Having known several friends and family members who declared witnessing large bipedal hairy creatures in New Jersey, I immediately surmised this, too, must be a Bigfoot or Sasquatch type creature.  After all, I''ve worked several seasons with very large animals at Great Adventure''s Safari Park. I''ve touched, fed and/or pet elephants, rhinos, American Black Bear, European Brown Bear, tigers, leopards, bison, elk, etc., therefore I feel I have slightly better idea as to the average person, what size animal could make such a disturbance.  In addition, I have a fair understanding of a variety of large North American mammal''s behavior, and this seemed to fit nothing other than Bigfoot.                                      As I stood there mostly in silence, the animal slowly proceeded deeper into the swamp, all the while smashing and crashing.  Since I understood that bigfoots normally don''t harm humans, at one point I quietly verbalized to myself, \"MAN, THIS IS REALLY COOL.\"  On the other hand I thought that if this thing is as angry as it sounds, I didn''t want it to come bebopping onto the trail, since there was likely little or nothing I could do to protect myself.                                           <BR>As the ruckus began to dissipate, it seemed as if the creature wanted me to believe that it was further into the swamp than it actually was. I estimated it to have stopped at approximately forty five yards away.  I stood there quietly for a number of minutes but heard absolutely nothing, not even a bird.  I then slowly proceeded down the trail in search of any type of tracks, but saw nothing other than mine.  Some distance down the trail, I came upon where the creek is at its closest, then heard what sounded as if either a very large animal jumped into the stream, or another large wet log was smashed, about forty five yards away.  I stood there silently for a few more minutes but heard no further noise, then I proceeded home.  At one point I had realized this creature must have paralleled me from the time I first heard it, to the last smash or splash, and yet during that period I didn''t hear so much as a twig snap!                         After further contemplating the matter, I feel there may have actually been two creatures; one making the initial vocalization, and yet another the ruckus.  After going on-line listening to recordings of alleged bigfoot vocalizations, I came across one in particular that sounds nearly identical to what I heard yet quite unlike any other animal with the exception of a chimpanzee.  [The high pitched sound of the 1972 aggressiveness and whistles from Al Berry and Ron Moorehead.]                  From time to time I revisited the location and on Sept. 3rd, 2016, I strongly feel that I had found a stick formation right between where I heard the initial sounds and the last smash or splash.                                          From 2011, until now, I am convinced that the weight of the animal smashing through the swamp must have been at least twice the weight of a fully grown male black bear, or equal to that of a male grizzly bear, at least 600 pounds.",

    " On June 20th at approximately 6:40 pm I was travelling on Route 563 south of Chatsworth near the Franklin Parker Preserve speedwell entrance. I was looking to see what the parking situation was there for a future hike so my eyes were on the right side of the road when out of the periphery I saw what I thought was a ground hog on the left. It was very large and I realized that it would have to be a huge ground hog so I looked fully to the left and I saw an approximate 3 to 3.5'' tall creature stand up on two legs as I passed by. I did not get a good look at the face and I almost continued but I decided to turn around about 150 yards up on a dirt road that''s on the right. <BR><BR>I pulled in and turned around and headed back to the location. There is a bend in the road there. It bends around to the right on the way back as I made it past the bend, approximately 30 yards in front of me the creature was still there. It was now fully turned towards me and I could see that it looked like a cross between Curious George and the character Chaka from the land of the lost. It''s face and hands as well as the tops of it''s feet were hairless and a light tan in color. The fur it was covered with was a golden brown a little darker than a golden retriever, very much like the color of a groundhog. I could not see the nose. Wen I locked eyes with it I could not see whites just big dark brown eyes. It stood there for a second or two when I rounded the bend and then took off running back into the swampy area. It ducked behind a short bush and when I drove past it I could no longer see it. <BR><BR>I turned the car around again and when I went by again it was gone. I waited there a bit to see if I could see anything moving in the field. I couldn''t so I took off. It was a couple days before I shared the experience with my family and friends. In that period of time I thought for sure someone was going to report a missing kid in a Halloween costume. <BR><BR>When the thing took off running it was fast! I would describe it as the fastest kid on the 10-12 baseball team. <BR><BR>We had really bad storms that night and my commute was a disaster. It poured all through that area and I thought it was odd that the thing I saw appeared to be dry, at least the fur was.     <BR><BR>         ",

    " This sighting had happened when me and my girlfriend were driving on one of the dirt trails off Route 72.  We had just gotten on the trail and I wanted to stop for a second.  After being stopped for a few minutes, I looked up and noticed my girlfriend looked like she had just seen a ghost.  She said that she just saw something tall and light brown walk across the road we were on.  So I said it was probably just a deer or something.  <BR><BR>I got out and looked around, and I saw some bushes moving and heard some rustling.  As soon as I turned my head I saw this face of an animal about 6 feet high looking straight at me through this big pile of brush.  The face itself was black but the hair was a dark sandy to light brown color.  It looked like the face of an ape.  The hair on the top of its head was somewhat long.<BR><BR>After looking at it for a few seconds I shook my head to see if i had seen what I thought I had, while I was doing so the animal had run away.  I saw it running for a second but then I turned back  to my car and got in.  Once I was in I asked her what she thought she saw.  She said that it was the same thing she had seen when we went camping six months prior to this.  <BR><BR>We went camping near Tuckerton but we had taken a detour to Apple Pie Hill.  There is a ranger lookout tower there, so went to the top and she looked down and said what the hell is that.  I pointed my flashlight in the direction but didn''t see anything.  She said she saw something running in front of the tower and it looked like the same thing she had seen. But once I had gotten back into my car I looked around for it again but didn''t see it.  So I put my window down and started driving, I could hear something running toward my car so I stopped and turned off my car again.  I still heard something coming my way, it sounded like a human or something running on two feet as opposed to a animal on 4 feet galloping through the woods.  After a few minutes of listening she was getting nervous so I had turned around and headed home.",

    " Riding my bike through the woods with some friends. I had to stop to wait for them. When I heard a branch snap, No more than 40 ft away it looked right at me with large black eyes. It was about 8''-9'' tell, I got a good look too I will never forget. He was proportioned the same way a human being would be, it was scary. With blackishbrown-rust colored hair. The hairs on his arm were about 3\"-4\" long. His forearm was about the size around as my leg. About 20 inches around. His strides  were long say 10'' per step. He must have been watching me for sometime cause I was stopped already a minute. When I heard a  branch snap, I glanced over I was shocked and tried to figure out what I was looking at. He just stared. No noise, no motions, no jesters,  no nothing. Very frightening cause you don''t know what he is capable of. It was as if he was thinking of coming towards me. He was very close, I froze like a rock. I turned my head to see what my friends were doing. Then turned back to look at him, he was still there. I know he got a good look at me too, cause it looked like he stooped his head down slightly and peered hard at me. Then he turned raised his arm to gain his balance and stepped into the woods. He didn''t turn away from me but rather walked to my left his right then I lost sight of him.  I have told this story to many many people but I don''t think anybody believes what I saw. I guess like I didn''t believe either until I saw one with my own eyes. ",

    " It was at least 2:00 am, in January or Februrary. The temprature was in the low teens. <BR><BR>I was dropping a friend off at his home, the back of which was separated from the Highway (Rt.72) by about 150 to 200 yards of woods and a dirt road.<BR><BR>There are no homes or streetlights on this part of Rt.72. The east side of Rt.72 is completely untouched woods for miles into Burlington county. This area was the end of a development that had never been finished.  Work stopped in the late 1970''s, as part of the Pinelands Preservation Act. <BR><BR><BR>There was a dirt road about 30 yards behind the house,which connected to the East into a grid of unfinished, unpaved roads. At that time his house was the last house on that road, completely surrounded by woods.  <BR><BR>We were talking beside the car under the streetlight for at least 20 minutes, when we both heard a woman screaming.  It sounded like it was coming from the unpaved road behind his house. We both thought someone was in trouble, so we ran inside his house and grabbed a flashlight, knife, and a hatchet. <BR> <BR>We ran into a trail along the right side of the house, (south-east) which led out to the dirt road. We could hear the screams getting louder and more to our right in the woods.|<BR><BR> We were only about 40 paces into the woods, when I started feeling very uneasy, and I started to realize that this wasn''t a woman screaming. I could hear it now to my right, more like a loud whistling now (not ahead in the dirt road like I had thought) about 15 yards away.<BR><BR>We both stopped and listened for a few seconds, my friend had the flashlight scanning the woods which was new growth oak saplings, blueberry bushes (waist high) and 12'' to 14''ft. scrubby pine saplings(20 years old?). I could hear it heaving as it breathed in and exhaled out with a very loud high pitched whistling, we couldn''t see anything but It was very close to our right as we faced southeast -- within 10 yards. <BR><BR>  My friend immediately turned toward me and said \"that ain''t no girl screaming\" and quickly moved past me back toward the house. I was standing still and listening, it was still screaming right at us. At this point I knew it wasn''t a girl at all, more like a loud whistling is how I could best describe it. There was no noise other than the screams. There was no movement at all. No sound of struggle. I thought that it might be a wounded animal, like a deer or something. <BR><BR>It was so loud and the deep breathing noises were from a much bigger animal than a fox. I could distinctly hear it breathing in and out rapidly to make the screaming noise.  I remember thinking that it''s dangerous to be this close to a large wounded animal.  It was not like anything I had ever heard in my life. I turned and headed back, looking and listening. It was still screaming, but did not follow. <BR><BR><BR>We immediately called the police and reported it. Within 15 minutes we went back outside, now the screams were further toward the south-east, very faint now. It had definitely moved off quickly. The screams faded totally within 10 minutes. We listened for at least another 45 minutes but it was gone.<BR><BR>I don''t know what the police had done after we''d called. I had always thought it was a wounded animal of some kind. <BR>",

    " Me, my cousin Kevin and my three friends Timmy, Tyler, and Steve were walking round in the woods maybe a mile from my house in October or November of 2007. We always used to go out in the woods and do dumb stuff like spy on the construction  workers that worked at a nearby construction(1/2 mile away) site. We always knew that there was something fishy going on in those woods, but when something freaky happened we never stuck round to find out what. So we are about to enter the woods from a field and I start smelling this foul stench. I don''t say anything at first because I didn''t think I had to. I didn''t think anything of it, until I was taking a leak facing the woods, when about 20 feet down the tree line where my friends were, the brush started shaking violently, no one said anything, we just pointed our flashlights and I pointed my camera, but it was too far away at night to catch anything (if the night-vision on the camera was working I could have had something on video, but oh well). My friend said he saw a broad pair of  shoulders move right through the brush. We quickly decided it was a deer w/barely any further speculation. On our way through the valley, my friend (Timmy) noticed something run down the hill we were on, but it wasn''t clear enough to determine what it was. We got across the creek and a big tree that fell over was moved a good 10 feet from its previous position, and me and my cousin are pretty strong guys and we couldn''t move it at all. So naturally we were baffled. On our way out of the valley when we heard something moving in the brush next to us, so we all shined our flashlights at the bushes. My cousin and my friends Timmy and Tyler claim to have seen a pair of shoulders, when the lights where shined. I didn''t have a good angle, but I did see it as it crouched and shimmied its way through really thick brush. My 6''4 310 pound cousin was so scared, that he trucked right through some water to get out of there, we were all scared.",

    " This happened in the spring of 1975 in Pennsville N.J.  This part of town backed up to a wooded area that in turn merged with the wildlife refuge at Finns Point.  I lived in an apartment complex that backed up to the woods.  I was eleven  years old at the time but remember it like yesterday.  I was just after dark and I was taking the garbage out to the dumpster.  Two friends of mine came running from behind the building in a panic.  I ask what was wrong and they said they had seen a huge whitesh covered creature at the edge of the woods.  These kids were a year or two younger then me.  Me being the older decided to get my fathers 12 volt spotlight and take a look.  <BR><BR>As we made our way to the woods about 65 feet behind the nearest apartment, my flashlight caught a pair of glowing red eyes. About fifty feet from the edge of the woods.  There appeared to be a large creature on two legs behind a stand of trees.  The hair on my neck stood up and we all ran to tell our parents.

    " I was a Boy scout in the early 70\"s on a camping trip.on a summer night a friend and myself were walking on a gravel road with tall pine trees on both sides ,it was in the bass river state forest.the moon was full and we were getting ready to crest a hill when we smelled something really foul,I thought something was dead ,and nearby,I didn''t really think much of it. we crested the gravel hill when we heard gravel being kicked ,mind you the only light we had was the moon light.when we heard this we stoped and I was a little scared cauce I thought it might be some guy in the woods scopen us out. we were froze for a few moments as to not make any noise ,then we both saw a silhouette of a very large thing and what ever it was ,we were able to make out that it was like a giant hair ball running across the road.we were pretty scared at this point and looked at each other and said words like lets get the hell out of here .my guess is that it was at least 7'' tall with a heavy stride.we both took off back to camp,when we got back we told our scoutmaster and all he did was laugh and say \"ya sure now go to bed\".I kinda voided it out of my mind for years always beleving that something WAS there,and i just kept it to myself.Then I found your site and read the siteing of the boy on the bike in manahawkin,N.J<BR>thats about 3 miles from where we thought we seen one.I,m 37 now and to this day I still think about that night and wounder to myself was i dreaming that night or not.I DON''T THINK I WAS",

    " Have been out scouting research locations for snake studies on google earth and found an area that we really wanted to check out which was an open paleodune ridge that offered plenty of basking/nesting habitat that the snakes we were researching liked to use. The hike there was pretty rough, walking through knee deep wetlands at points and wrestling with tangles of greenbrier and other thorny bushes to get to the location which was about a mile and a half back into the woods. Upon finally arriving at the site we were able to settle down and start looking for good spots that the snakes we were looking for used. As we were walking up one of the ridge fingers, we came upon an abandoned hunting stand that looked like it could be used as a shelter. I was a little unnerved because we didnt really wanna run into someone out there especially if they werent expecting company. <BR>As I was looking around my friend went back behind me to look around or use the bathroom while I continued to look. <BR>I began to hear bipedal walking in the swamp below us, what sounded like sticks breaking and snapping. I was pretty freaked out thinking it was a hunter so I yelled down at it saying hello? Anyone there?. No response as I continued to look I saw part of a dark figure go tree from tree. Long enough to know I wasnt imagining it, but not long enough to identify shape, size and detail. My memory fails to remember exactly how tall off the ground it was but the encounter lasted several seconds, from when I first heard the walking, saw the dark flash and when it subsequently disappeared or stopped in the swamp. After this I rounded up my friend and we headed out of there pretty quickly not knowing if a nearby hunter was there or worse, some crazy dude was stalking us. <BR>A few days went by before I really began to realize what I could have seen and it just made little sense that someone was out there  messing with us. <BR>Have since returned to the location to look some things over, large game trails surround the dune. But other than that, not much further evidence was able to be found.",

    "As described above, the spot of the incident was on top of a large paleodune ridge (sandy, upland areas) with thick swamp surrounding the area. The ridge itself had an undergrowth of low bush blueberry and huckleberries with pitch pine trees spread out sparsely without about a 25-50 % canopy coverage, so very open. Large cranberry bog nearby that has lots of prey items such as various frog species, deer, fox, snakes and lots of edible vegetation.",

    " At approximately 7 PM on Wednesday, November 16, Jon E., Dan F., Dan W. and James O. and I met at my house to watch a Philadelphia 76er''s game.  While watching, Dan F. noticed a human-like creature walking in the street in front of my house.  From the living room window, we all observed a creature which appeared to be just under six feet tall walking away from my house.  The creature was about 150 feet away and passed under a street light, which gave us the ability to get a decent look at it.  It was long limbed, but clearly not human.  Because of the lighting it was in silhouette, but we could see that it was covered with hair.  It was walking with its shoulders hunched forward, and did not appear to be in any distress.  We watched it pass from view as it went behind trees and into the woods on the far side of the street.<BR><BR>I live in a quiet neighborhood that is located in a wooded area.  My house is on a street that is a cul-de-sac, and there is very little traffic.  There is a quarry less than a quarter mile away through the woods.  In the 14 years that I have owned this house, I have routinely heard animal calls that can''t be identified as dog barks, etc., and have seen droppings and footprints in the woods that have not been from any animal such as a deer, etc., that would be seen in this area.<BR><BR>This is the first instance in which I have seen a creature that I believe is a bigfoot.  Because we were all shocked by what we saw, we did not attempt to pursue this creature, but we were able to observe it for 5-7 seconds before it passed from view.<BR><BR>In the minutes that followed, we all discussed what we saw.  While my friends, who do not live in this neighborhood, were initially reluctant to acknowledge that it was a bigfoot, after I explained the things that I have heard and seen around my house over the years, we all agreed that the creature was not human, and clearly fit the description of a bigfoot.

She said that she had heard it, but with the noise from the wind rushing through the windows it hadn''t registered. <BR><BR>I decided that the sound was too odd and urgent to ignore, so I made a U-turn at the next possible point and slowly made my way back to the section of road where the sound came from. As we approached the stand of trees (now on my right), we began to hear the shrieking sound again. I stopped the vehicle near to the point where the sound was coming from. The shrieks would last about 4 or 5 seconds with a one or two second pause in between. Our immediate impression was that it was like a young woman in sheer terror or agony. After a very brief moment we decided that no, it sounded more like a hawk or an eagle. Then, again we thought it could be human, because it was just too powerful to be coming from a small animal. <BR><BR>Unable to determine what the sound was, I decided to honk the horn to see what the reaction would be. There was no change in the shrieking so we decided that there probably wasn''t a crime in progress, because the perpetrator would probably have stopped, or the victim would have intensified or vocalized their pleas. At this point about 20 seconds had passed since we had returned to the area. The sounds seemed to be coming from the far edge of the trees, about 15 yards away, so we were unable to see where they were coming from because of the dark. We decided that to determine if something or someone was in danger or hurt I should step out and yell into the trees to see if the shrieking would stop, which I did armed with my sons wooden baseball bat. The first time I hollered the shrieking faltered and the second time I hollered the sounds stopped altogether. Total elapsed time since returning to the site was probably less than 30 seconds.<BR><BR>I got back in the vehicle and we waited several minutes and the sound didn''t continue. We went for a short drive and stopped at the area a few minutes later but we didn''t hear the sound again. My wife and I have discussed the incident several times and have never come up with a satisfactory explanation as to what could have made those sounds.<BR><BR>I grew up in Canada, where I spent most of my summers camping in the wilderness, so I can easily identify most animal sounds and responses. This creature didn''t seem to behave like an animal would when approached by a vehicle, a horn, or myself, until I hollered extremely loud two times. The sound was distressed, extremely loud, bordered on human, but was definitely not human, and I have no explanation for it. <BR><BR>",

    " I have e-mailed you before but wasn''t ready to describe my encounter.I have also offered to help in the area of investigations I am experienced in the outdoors and have tracking skills among other skills that would be helpful I am an experienced investigator as well as acriminal justice student.I had an experience many years ago in Jackson NJ, I was a teenager then. My younger brother and I and 3 friends set out to steal some wood from a house that was being built to build on our fort. We really didn''t think anything wrong of it at the time we were all pretty young.It was about 8:00 pm when we set out we would have to walk back through our friends property to get to the house. About 3 acres of property past some old chicken coupes and down a narrow path with thick vegitation and trees.I was in the lead position and everyone else following single file through the woods. All I had was a small disposable flashlight it only covered about a 10 foot distance. We figured one flash light so there would be less of a chance of being spotted. As we past the chicken coupes we heard a sound ahead of us in the darkness but figured it to be our friends dog, thinking it followed us. We kept going I was still in the lead with the flash light it was just pitch dark around us surrounded by trees and bushes we could no loger see any house lights from our friends house. I would shine the light behind me now and then to make sure my brother was ok and everyone was keeping up. Then I got butterflies in my stomach I felt like some one was watching us telling my friends to be quiet so I could listen for any one. I shined the flashlight around but couldn''t see anything then I heard a noise in front of us I spun around and all I could see was a very large figure what ever it was it''s eyes reflected red it looked like a siloute in the darkness with my small light. I tried to talk to it saying hows it going? but got no response then the figure moved closer and I got scared and yelled to my friends to run  but they began to pick up anything they could to throw it at the figure once that happened I heard a deep low growl and began too run right past my brother and friends. Then they followed suit when i got to the chicken coupes I plowed through the door and my friends and brother followed me in.We were scared as hell we didn''t move for probably an hour we just sat there listening for this thing. When we got brave enough we ran all the way back to our friends house telling his mom and dad what happened but they did not believe us. We then decided to brave again and go back out to look for this thing with base ball bats. We did alot of talking but never went back I think we were just trying to save face with each other. I know what I saw wasn''t a man it was just to big and the eyes were red like a dark red. And I never heard of any bears in Jackson NJ and I lived there for at least 13 years. So I don''t know what it was but i''m positive it wasn''t a man.",

    "   Even after all of these years, I still find it difficult to discuss what exactly I saw.    I still vividly remember the encounter and how terrified my friend and I were afterwards.  Its amazing how time slows during intense moments, every detail is burned to memory, but in actuality only several seconds passed.  To be honest, I dont know exactly what I saw that summer evening long ago.  As a child growing up, we were taught in school the legends surrounding the Jersey Devil and weird happenings in the Pine Barrens.  Hopefully this story wont be viewed as lore that the region is famous for.  The only thing I can say for sure is, it really did happen and I will do my best to portray the event as I remember it. <BR>  I grew up in a middle size town, a few miles from both the Jersey shore and the edges of the Pine Barrens.  My neighborhood & town were undergoing a growth spurt and wooded areas where I played as a kid were now strip malls or homes.  My house was on a corner lot and the neighbors house directly in front was a summer cottage (they were not there at the time).  I was 18 in 1989 and recently graduated from high school, with a strict midnight curfew.  My friend dropped me off on time with the passenger side of the car facing the front of my house.  I was outside of the car talking to Scott through the passenger side window, when we both heard a rustling sound near the trees on the corner of my neighbors property, about 30 feet away.  There was a street light on the opposite corner, and I could not make anything out beyond it.  We didnt think much of it and continued to talk.  The rustling returned a little louder, and with a sound that I remember as something being dragged on concrete such as a stick.  <BR><BR>At this point I asked Scott if he saw anything over there.  At first he replied no, then he hesitated and said he sees something like a big dog that is sitting by the trees.  Not wanting to be bit by some rabid dog, I got in the car.  We went up the road and turned the car around on the opposite intersection.  Once around, we were facing my house, and there was what appeared to be a large grayish dog directly under the street lamp.  We started moving very slowly towards my house, and as we got closer it really didnt appear to be like any dog I had every scene before.  When we were about 50 feet away, I turned to Scott and asked him to turn on the high-beams.  It is here where things happened very quickly, and I will try to capture it as best I can.  To our horror, what we thought was a large dog stood up and began to run on two legs.  It crossed the car and ran on an angle at first towards the middle of my house, but then quickly changed course and went around the dark side of my house.  We were both yelling, what the h**l, was that repeatedly.  The creature was very tall, his head was taller then the top of the windows on the house so I estimate around 8-feet.  He appeared to be a light gray in color, but it could have been the lights reflecting off his hair.  His arms were long and lanky, and sort of swayed forward and aft as he ran.  The creature had amazing speed/agility, and ran with what one would consider to be an odd gait.  His head was tilted forward and he might have been slightly hunched over.  His head swayed between looking forward and looking at us.  I will never forget the way his eyes reflected in the headlights.  The total time we had eyes on the creature was between 3-5 seconds.  Once he disappeared, the car accelerated around the corner and Scott slammed on the brakes.  Expecting to see the creature in the headlights, there was nothing but dark road..he was gone.  <BR><BR>Not wanting to get out of the car we proceeded to Scotts house a few miles away.  After a quick phone conversation with my parents, they ordered me home.  They were waiting out front when we got there, and we tried to explain what we saw.  My parents would hear none of our tale and assumed we were either drunk, or on drugs.  We were both rather shaken by the event, and my parents began to question their original assessment.  Over time came the inevitable ridicule of family and friends, and with their mocking I never really wanted to discuss this with anyone again.           <BR><BR>It took years before I was comfortable being alone, especially at night.  After spending time in the military, I came to the realization that he was as scared of us, as we were of him.  While I no longer have the fear, there isnt a day that has gone by without me thinking of that night.                  <BR>",

    " 2 weeks ago i went into the pine barrons in manchester nj ,deep in forest to shoot a pistol. i left the gun in the car and scoped out the area before i started shooting. i started down a trail and when i turned the corner i heard heavy heavy footsteps run away from me and smell a skunky/homeless person type oder. i looked around area but saw nothing. then i walked in another direction and found a stream or pond.  then something threw a rock into the water making a good size splash. i now went back to the truck and got my gun when i went back to the trail. i saw nothing but thought this might be a bigfoot. couldnt stop thinking about it so i went back a couple days later with a bigger gun and an axe. when i got to the spot where this hapened i heard a loud call like choom choom choom choom. this startled me and i cocked the hammer. i then heard footsteps coming tawards me in the thick vegitation. it came within 15 feet away and stopped. i could not see it through the brush. with my gun pointed in its direction it threw a large stick that landed along side of me.  i said \"hello ?\"  any body there, but no reply. i almost emptyed the gun into the bush but desided not to because i cuoldnt see the creature. i could smell it ,feel it, here it, and it threw something at me twice! i backed off and walked back to my truck the whole time ready to shoot if it atacked me.when i reached the truck this thing let out another call only much louder and much closer choom choom many times. a small bird on a tree branch began to act crazy. i took this warning and left. this sunday i went back with food, i took food to the spot where it threw the stick and backed away. then i heard some vocalizeations and got one of them on mini disc recording. sounds kinda like / coo coo kaa kaakaa coo coo ka kakka. went back to the trail to see if food was gone and was met by more stange bird behavior. many birds fleww rapidly out of trail as if some thing scared them out. when i looked down the trail i heard a loud snap of a tree or branch being broken. i backed away and soon after heard some low moans and groans, much too low to be a person. i also smelled the same oder again. this thing has an exeptional abilty to hide. all three times it was very close to me but for some reason i could not see it. i am convinced this is a sasqatch or more than one of them. i can take you or researchers to this place in nj pine barrons. this story is not a hoax and i dont beleive a person would be dumb enough to throw sticks and rocks at a man with a gun! i saw alot of good size trees (5or6inchdiameter) broken in half.",

    " Ok so I would like to keep this somewhat discreet because my family still to this day use what I told them as a joke against me and I don''t need everyone in my town talking about me cause this just sounds ridiculous. This happened near Toms River NJ. Me and my buddy were on our way to a job in Browns Mills and we''re traveling down route 70 which is known as the pine barrens. It was sometime between 6/7 am and about 7 deer came shooting out from the right side going left across route 70. I didn''t slam on brakes cause it was like 50 feet in front of us but I stopped pretty fast and I kid you not there was a big hairy grey and brown thing that came running right up to about 3 feet from the pavement and it stopped and turned around and ran the other way back into the woods. Since I seen this I started watching that finding Bigfoot show but their videos and pics are always something black. This thing was light grey and brown and it was huge! I mean huge like 8 foot tall and big like fat big. It could not be a guy cause it had like hair all over its face! Like I didn''t even see its eyes or lips or nose.  It was like hair for a face. We seen this thing at about 25/35 feet. I know it was real cause my man was like totally in sync with describing it to each other. It was all we talked about the rest of the way to the job. It was like what I was thinking he was saying and vice versa.  This was two months ago and that was it. Hope this helps you!",

    " Me and 2 friends were walking up the gas pipeline to fish a natural spring on the mountain, now privately owned by a hunting and fishing club. As we crested our first hill, all three of us all stopped at the same time. We saw a Bigfoot about 200 ft up the pipeline. I would estimate it to be over 7ft tall, brown and very shaggy. After about 30 seconds it ran into the wood line. It covered about 30 feet in three strides and disappeared. As we got to where it was you could see four spots where the tall grass was was pushed down from its steps.",

    " On a friday night in October of 1969 at 9:30pm,  me and another person were sitting in a car on Serviss Ave in North Brunswick, New Jersey. I was 15 years old at the time, and had just come home from a night out.  <BR><BR>We were parked on the right hand side of the dead end side of the block.  There are two houses on the right side of the street, then there is woods, and then Lawrence Brook. <BR><BR>The moonlight was shining from behind the car towards the brook. While talking I glanced up towards the brook when I seen two red eyes in the middle of the road about 35 to 40feet away. Immediatly I said \"whats that thing in the road?\" The driver turned his headlights on and thats when we could see that this thing was not a dog or, person, or bear.  This thing was hunched down on the ground, and from the ground to the top of its head, it looked to be three and a half to four feet tall. <BR><BR>After the headlights were turned on it sat there for about thirty second. We saw that it was hairy with three to four inch length reddish/brown hair and while standing it was about five feet tall. <BR><BR>After the thirty seconds it stood up turned around and sort of waddled into the woods at a snails pace.  We guessed it was ticked off by the headlights, and good thing because we were scared and locked our doors. <BR><BR>Once it went into the woods I exited the car and ran into the house. The driver threw the car into reverse backed out into Nassay Street, threw the car into gear and sped off down to Livingstone Ave. <BR><BR>After I went inside my house I told my mother, whose answer was it must have been a dog or bear, and thought nothing of it.  This was a one time occurance and I have not seen anything like it since, but I did hear other things when I lived there.",

    " Hi, It was october about 1030pm I was comeing home with a friend from work. you see we run a camp ground in the summer in bear mountian state park in NY. But we stay thier all year round,i love it. in the summer thier is lots of noise. We have as much as 300 kids at a time, overnite for 3 months. In late august every thing winds down. while the kids are thier you dont see much wild life. Even the deer, which we have a lot of,seem to find some where else to live. guess they dont like kids. It takes about a month for the woods to come back to life. this is the best time of the year because it is so quit. During the winters i do other work out side the camp to make money. this night I wasnt driving so i like to watch what the head lights find. the road are windy so the light ofen pan the sides where you might see a racoon or a bear. well driving in to our camp thier is a few s turns. when i saw some thing siting on a boulder about 30 to 40 yards up on the hill. I freaked, I asked my friend if he hsd seen that and he said what. I said back up and he did. when the lights hit it I said stop! wow It was brown hairy but you still saw some skin. It wasnt sitting it was crouching on all 4s. it ha dbeen stairing at my friends cabin, where his wife was alone. i was stairing right at it and i was close. when the head light hit it it sat for 3-4 sec stairing, before it leaped from a crouched position about 9 feet to anouther rock. It stud up and began to run away on two legs. I saw it run for about 15 to 20 feet before i couldnt see it any more. it was running down the other side of the hill. my friend still didnt see it. I asked him to drive up this little acsess road to get more close. but it was gone.",

    " <BR>In mid July, I was sitting at my computer at night, playing a computer game, with the television on behind me.  I was watching my sister''s dog while they were on vacation, and she was laying down in the other room.  At perhaps 7pm or 8pm I heard a howl in the distance, very far behind my house.  This is not uncommon, since there is a heavily wooded area where there are hills, and bears often live in the area.  A call from a mother to a cub is not unheard of, especially in evening hours.  <BR><BR>I made sure the dog was in the house and then went to the back and shut the back door.  I was not scared of anything getting in, but the dog often will run through a screen door to get to honking geese passing by, a neighbors dog or even a rabbit if it sees one in the back yard.  I heard the same, distant howl again a few minutes later and dismissed it.<BR><BR>I went back and played my video games for another hour, and then I heard the sound again, but it chilled me more so then I can ever explain in words to another.  The noise was not a bear, nor could any bear ever make such a sound  Bears make sounds which are deep and even grunting, however this was one that can only be described as a ''screaming howl.''  <BR><BR>What shook me so much, was that the sound litteraly was just outside my window, perhaps 20 feet or so, and was so loud, I litteraly almost fell out of my seat, it shocked me so baddly.  In the summer my windows are open, but to discourage bugs I keep the blinds closed.  My window is perhaps 8 feet off the ground on the side of the house, just to give a feel for the area.  <BR><BR><BR>Immediately my heart raced so fast, it hurt.  I knew for a fact, all I had to do was draw the blinds open and I could see what it was, since it was still light out, yet I could not.  I was paralyzed for the first and only time in my life.  I waited, expecting to hear the sound again, yet did not.  Finally after about a minute, I went out of my room and went into a more central room in the house trying to get away fom the sound, yet I would be damned if I would go near one of the screen doors.  In my parents room I found my sisters dog, and this animal, who usualy will bark and growl at anything, was laying in a corner, curled up and it had deficated all over the floor.  As soon as it saw me it just whimpered.  I closed the door and I myself sat down near it and waited for perhaps 10 minutes and after that, finally gathered enough courage to shut and lock all the doors, and didn''t hear or see anything afterwards.  The dog refused to come out of the room the entire night.<BR><BR>I am a 23 year old male who is 6 feet tall and 260 lbs, yet I was terrified plain and simple.  I had no idea what it was, and I still do not to this day.  I did not tell my parents of relatives, because they will simply say it was a bear, and perhaps it was, but I have NEVER heard a bear, nor any other animal make such a sound before.  ",

I pulled up to the house adjacent to the road leaving the truck running and lights on. I could smell a skunk like smell but thought nothing of it. I loaded the machine on the trailer, chained down one side crossed in front of the truck and noticed red eyes at about 75-100 ft down the road looking back at me they seemed taller than 6'' , just out of range of head lights. I quickly got the other side truck and chained the other side down and ran back to cab of the truck and saw the same eyes stairing back. I got into the cab and told the other person with me I had seen something. I looked up and the eyes had moved off into woods to the left. My problem was there was no way to back down the road and I had to trough where this thing was standing. I started the truck up the hill past the point I had seen the eyes and continued past to the in the road and prayed I could 10 point turn this thing turned around and get out of there. Upon pulling onto the side road and backing up and trying to get the truck turned around I saw those eyes 30 ft off into the woods looking back at me, eye level. This truck is a medium duty international 1954 series eye level is about 7 ft. I got the truck into gear and started down the road as fast as I could. Not looking back until I was several miles down the road. I told my friend I saw bear or wolve as to not alarm them. I know that bears dont walk up right at a steady level and they ussally run off after any encounter.",

    "  Well last year I was night fishing 9/2010 at Amawalk Reservior SOMERS NY about 30 minutes from PAWLINGS I was fishing with my buddy..the reservior was about 100ft into the lake before you got to water .....about 5am sun was coming out..when a 5 foot maybe 5 1/2 ft man  or Big Foot came out of the woods washed its face and drank some of the reservoir water..he looked like something out of the old school \"Planets of the Apes\" chimps..I said to my buddy \"you see that?\"?he said yes ..Now on Animal Planet there showing a clip of a Big Foot that has been seen in these areas (Lower Hudson Valley)..So I''m puzzled to think what I saw was a Big Foot....so this my account of what I saw..and we didn''t catch crap at night..anybody ever run into anything like this??...<BR><BR>This was my post on www.westchesterfishing.com<BR><BR>Low and be hold another member at the same reservior..Columbus day 2011..this is his post..Hey Guys,<BR>I put at Amawalk this summer and about the 5th time I took it out in early October.  I saw two upright walking chimp looking things walk out of the woods and crouch down and drink from the res, run back in to the woods and then do the same thing again.  When they came out the second time one of them threw it''s arms in the air while squatting and then they ran back into the woods.   The second one went back slowly.  It seemed like they saw something in the water right in front of them.  That was right when the sun came up.  I haven''t been back to my boat since.  I have no idea what they were and looked like two large chimps to me.  Maybe some guy who lives there has two monkeys or something?  I have no idea.  But I saw something that I can''t explain, it has been eating away at me since.  When I saw the preview for that show I almost shat myself.  When Biggame posted here I didn''t want to say that I saw something because I''m from Oregon and my hunting and logging part of the family thinks they know where they live but none of them have never ever seen them just have stories, just like everyone else in Oregon.  Then I saw what I saw in October and have been denying it to myself ever since.  I absolutely hope that someone owns two monkey''s on the Amawalk. <BR><BR>I have no reason to say something like this.  Before October I could have cared less if bigfoot existed, now I''m a bit curious.  I own a fishing rod company and have business to lose from people thinking I''m crazy for posting this on here.  This is a nothing to gain and allot to lose situation for me but, I had to say something when Biggame posted.  Let me be clear in saying that I saw something too.  I have no idea what they were and would need absolute proof that bigfoot existed before I would ever say thats what they were.  <BR><BR>So two seperate sightings same place different year..I BELIEVE!!!

    " I had parked my Volkswagen beetle at the junction of Rte. 17A and the Appalachian Trail, intending to camp out overnite along the trail.  I then hiked south on the trail about 4 miles, along a ridge that overlooks Greenwood Lake until I was perhaps just above the New Jersey line.  Since I had hiked this section of trail before I knew of an ideal camping site - a large outcropping of bedrock that rises about 10 feet above the surrounding terrain, and has a sheer drop off on the west side with a small swampy area on that side.  I unrolled my sleeping bag and bedded down as soon as it got dark, enjoying the magnificent view of the sky before dozing off.  About midnight I awoke for some unknown reason, and shortly after heard the most horrifying high pitched scream I had ever heard out in the woods, perhaps a 100 yards to my southeast.  I scrambled out of my sleeping bag, and quickly put my boots on.  Then the scream repeated itself, and I was positively terrified, as I knew it was miles in the dark to my car, and I had only a small flashlight.  Thinking to scare off, what I assumed was an animal, I screamed back at it, and was aghast when it returned my scream.  Several more screams were exchanged and then silence.  With my heart racing, I gathered up all the stones I could find in depressions in the rock I was camping on, and began throwing them in the direction the loud scream originated.  Then, to my horror, another scream came from a direction south-southwest of me, which astonished me as I heard no noise of movement, and in those days had extremely good hearing.  I hurled rocks in this direction, with more screams being exchanged.  This process went on for another hour, and then quiet, but I stayed up all night.  In the morning I checked the area where the noise had originated, and discovered it was covered with dry leaves, which made me more puzzled why I heard no noise. ",

    " My 2 best friends and I would take night rides into Harriman State Park late at night to see what we can spot at night, i.e. bear, deer, fox, etc. Its a beautiful park and the solitude at night in the off season makes the park special. Creepy too!  <BR><BR>As we were driving the very windy Garden Valley Rd we had to go slow due to the turns and danger of the steep drop offs on the road side. I was a front seat passenger, high beams on. Driving no more the 25-30 mph.  At the max viability of the headlight I see the outline of a large upright being running across in front of us and leaping the bank on the high side of the road, instantly disappearing into rhododendron thickets. I freaked out upon first visual and alerted my friends. The driver hit the breaks, windows open we could hear thrashing of the ground from running  but the sighting was over.  <BR><BR>My friend the driver did see movement but couldn''t make out what I made out. We both agreed on the sound of it fleeing up the steep slope. What solidified my two friends belief in what I saw was the look of fright and amazement on my face. Features of the upright being I saw were large thick long hair covered legs, human like strides, and tall enough that the headlights did not focus above its midsection, so I couldn''t make out facial features.  We were not drinking or doing any illegal substances.  <BR><BR>I would love to be able to speak to the park worker who had a sighting in the same location. I am so excited to finally be able to tell this encounter. ",

I followed them and they led around the back of our house to another tree.  The footprints then circled around the area in front of the tree about 4 full circles and then stopped.  There were no footsteps leading from the circle to anywhere else, as well as no footsteps back to the front of the house.

    " In the fall of 2000 my wife saw a large blk figure walking across a field and into the woods approx 300 yards from our home.My children stated that they saw something big and hairy behind our house approximately 3-5 days later. We never told them about moms sighting. also we had recently purchased the property and the home had been vacant for some time (curiousity ?) in the fall and winter of 2008 I heard some rather strange sounds when i was in the woods across from my home this happened when I was walking,hunting and cutting firewood. The first incident was when I was walking in the woods looking for deer sign for the upcoming hunting season.What i heard was something striking a tree with a piece of wood very loudly and repeatedly 5-6 times. I tried to duplicate the noise in an attempt to communicate but to no avail.Prior to the banging I would swear that i was being watched.I also found a strange footprint at the base of a cluster of cedar trees, the print was 8-10 inches long but it was muddy and the print was not clear but looked as something slipped in the mud the print was human like but not human.the cedar tree was stripped of bark for some reason.The next incident was while hunting I heard 2 somethings that were very heavy walking on the ice and breaking through I thought that they were very large deer and that i would see them as they were coming towards me but they suddenly veered away and were never seen. The reason i know that they were heavy is that i weigh 270 pds and I was walking in the same area and i did not break through.I have heard long screams at night coming from the same area and the latest incident I was cutting firewood and when i shut the saw off i heard a large amount of vocalization coming from approx 1/4 mile away. These noises could only be described as monkeys yelling at each other,and the reason I say that is ,while on vacation in TN I went to a outside zoo near Nashville and there were white faced monkeys there and the vocalizations that they made were very similar.I downloaded a file from the Sierra sounds and played this for my wife, she said those are birds i hear them all the time outside. I proceeded to tell her that the noises were of a sasquatch not birds and i showed her the web site that i copied it from.I recall as a child seeing what i remember as a hairy man near a creek when my brothers and i were playing there, and we always felt that we were being watched when we were there.this creek was on my family''s property back in the woods not far from the swamp.

The neighbors house was about 8 to 10 feet away with no french between the properties.<BR><BR>On this particular night the light from the street light shown brightly into my bedroom and lit the entire room well enough to almost be able to read by its light. A few minutes after going to bed a \"figure\" moved into the light and cast a huge shadow on the opposing wall of my room. I amassed that this figure had to be standing with in only a few feet of my bedroom window do to the sharpness and size of the shadow. Also, considering the size of the shadow and the height of my window above the ground the figure had to stand at least 7 to 8 feet tall to cast such a shadow. I froze in my bed (and embarrsingly enough, I had wet myself in fright). I could not muster the strength to look out the window, I simply froze. the shadow remained for all of about 20 to 30 seconds, then it was gone. About three to four minutes later heard a very loud crash of wood and metal as someone or something had ripped off the door to our back storage room. I heard someone or something moving items, then I heard the big freezer chest open (and the toys I had left on the freezer fall to the ground). Again, I was still frozen with fear and in my bed, and could not moved. There were some loud bumps and bangs as if something was throwing bricks around the storage room (our storage room was approximately 16 feet by 32 feet and attached to the back side or lake side of the house). After the banging stopped the freezer lid slammed shut and all banging stopped.<BR><BR>Later that night my step dad and mom had come home from work around 3am (they owned the restaurant a few blocks away) and started screaming and my mom was very very panicked. My mom called one of her friends that was also a good customer and was a State Trooper. I don''t know what was said between them.<BR><BR>The next morning my step dad and two of his friends were trying the fix the door to the back room. This is when I first saw the damage done. The room looked as if it were turned upside down, then right side up. My step dads large roll-away tool box was on its side and on the other side of the room, and packages of frozen meet were all over the place. A car transmission had been tossed as if a toy. The freezer had some faint scratches on the side and on the lid, but no tool marks or pry bar marks (my parents normally kept the freezer locked).<BR><BR>These same scratches were located on the side of the house and the removed door. <BR><BR>Missing were packages of my mom''s frozen strawberries, and two frozen turkey''s. None of the prepackage streaks or hamburgers, or lobsters were taken (they used this freezer as a back up to the freezer at the restaurant). <BR><BR>The State Trooper friend of my Mom''s said that it looked like three or four people had to of done this, but could not offer an explanation to the faint scratch marks. When I told my mom of the shadow figure my mom would only start to cry and hug me, saying we were so lucky that God had protected me from this situation.<BR><BR>Of note was the conversation between my step dad and our neighbor. Our neighbor told my step dad that he too had seen some kind of shadowy figure moving between the houses. Our neighbor said he had tried to let his dog out to investigate, but the dog would not go outside. But as soon as the figure appeared, it had gone away, and he had gone back to watching tv. Our neighbor did not hear any of the knocking or bangs in our back room.<BR><BR>At this age I had not ever heard of Bigfoot. But later, (the next spring) the other boys were talking about a \"monster\" called bigfoot that had been on TV, and for the first time (since that night)I froze again in fear (for a few seconds this time) and somehow knew what they were talking about, and what they were describing.<BR><BR>",

    " My wife and I were driving on a blacktop secondary road at approx. 11:30 pm, while returning home from my stepson''s home in Berlin, N.Y. This is a relatively rural area, with large expanses of forested land, just west of the Massachusetts and Vermont state lines. About 1 mile from our home we came around a bend in the road where another road, Davitts Lake Rd, intersects the road we were traveling, Blue Factory Hill Rd., and forms a \"T\".  At this \"T\" there is a street light, and opposite Davitts Lake Rd, on the other side of Blue Factory Hill Rd. (the road we were on), is a 4-5 foot embankment sloping away from the shoulder of the road to a large field, also sloping downward from the road and ending at a line of trees approx. 100 yards from the road. There was (and still is) a barb wire fence which runs parallel to Blue<BR>Factory Hill Rd. along this 4-5 foot embankment, <BR>with the fence post set halfway down the embankment so that the top wire of the fence is about the same heigth or perhaps slightly higher than the shoulder of the road. <BR><BR>It is at this location at the abovementioned time, under the<BR>illumination of the street light that I clearly saw a figure in mid stride hurdling over the barbwire fence, whose body was completely covered with red colored hair, not unlike the color of a red fox. The hair on my neck tingled, as while I<BR>was certain of what I was seeing, my mind was<BR>coming up blank as to any reference of what it actually was, and I felt a sudden rush of fear. I said to my wife \" what the hell was that\", and as our vehicle drew near the spot where I first spotted the figure, I could not draw myself to stop the vehicle, or even look in the direction of the field on my left where the figure was running.<BR><BR>Using the telephone pole from which the street light is mounted as a point of reference, I would estimate this figure to stand approx. 7-8 feet tall, and was totally human-like in respect to moving upright. <BR><BR>At this point I will turn the report over to my wife who watched this figure run down the field.<BR><BR>I did not see the figure leaping over the barbed wire fence - but I did see it running through the field.  It was very large, covered in red hair as my husband described and running in an upright position swinging it''s \"arms\" back and forth as it ran.  I knew it wasn''t a bear or deer - and as I watched it disappear into the wooded area, I had goosebumps on my neck and knew I had just seen something which was very unusual.<BR><BR>This event occured several years ago, actually<BR>back in 1988. Naturally we have been reluctant to<BR>share our encounter, as when doing so with even<BR>our closest friends, we are met with comments such as basically we''re nuts, seeing things, or it was surely a bear or deer. But we do not know either to be able to run upright like a human!<BR><BR>So--- having found this website we guess it''s time to report this, as after viewing some TV programs about \"bigfoot\", the only illogical logical conclusion we can come to is that our<BR>red haired figure was in fact a bigfoot, and since we saw this, they must exist, for we are both absolutely certain of the description of what we saw.<BR>",

    " My friend and I finished preparing for a big outdoors event and we were sitting outside his home.  It was around 11 p.m and his wife and dog had gone inside for the evening.  Across the road from his house there is a large swamp that goes up to a small mountain.  Our talk was cut short by an odd scream about 75 yards into the swamp on the right at ground level.  I asked my friend, an avid hunter, what animal screams like that?  He didn''t know but we talked that maybe it could be an owl or a fisher.  A few minutes later, in the woods on our side of the road, a large animal broke a lot of dead branches all at once.  It wasn''t running but seemed to have just turned around in one location.  A minute or two later three owls hooted between themselves at treetop level in the woods behind his house.  The owls seemed to have been about 50 feet apart.  We commented about this sudden weird activity when something came from the woods and landed in his yard behind us.  We were still facing the road and didn''t see the object but I assume it was something around the size of a baseball.  He doesn''t have a manicured lawn and it would be impossible to know exactly what it was.  I''ve thought about this incident for a couple of months and could write off the first three occurrences that evening but the object landing in the yard made this event too much to ignore.

    " On February 15th, 2004 at approximately 9:30 PM in Petersburgh, NY a resident on a rural road noticed his dog chained outside was extremely agitated. He stepped out on his front porch, when he heard several shrieking screams. They were continuous in nature. He stepped in and asked his wife who was watching television to step out and she too heard it   <BR>scream. The witnesses have lived in Alaska and the male witness is an avid hunter. He has never heard anything of this nature in his life before and described the vocalization as \"un-Godly\" and the loudest thing he''d ever heard before. <BR>The next morning, he observed a set of footprints in the snow coming from across the road, up a steep embankment and across the field to the west of the house in a northwardly direction. The strides were described as 5 - 6 feet apart. Note the field was covered with approximately 14 inches of snow. The witnesses'' son tracked the foot prints into the forest behind the house where apparently a second set of footprints joined the original set. <BR>Witnesses have lived at the present location for the past twelve years and this is the first time anything of this nature was encountered.",

    " A friend and I had decided to do some cross country skiing on the property owned by some neighbors.  We started out behind my house and worked our way into the woods.  There is an old logging road about a mile in that we hooked up to.  It was a sunny day in January, with a steady but light snowfall.  Along the way we had taken note of different tracks, as the area is home to abundant wildlife.  At this point we had come across several deer tracks.  We were studying the tracks and noting that most were not fresh, as they were already filled with snow.  There is a point in the trail where it splits and you can go to the right or left.  We chose right and continued back in.  This route is fairly short and takes about 10 to 15 minutes to reach the end where it abruptly stops in a an open field.  At this point we chose to turn around and start back out.  When we reached the spot where the trail had split, we were coming down a slope and nearing the fork when we noticed what looked like fresh tracks in the snow ahead.  They looked fairly big in size, so we decided to stop and have a look, thinking we may have stumbled across some bear tracks, which are not uncommon to the area.  When we reached them, both of us just stared,  They were huge!  And deffinitely NOT bear tracks.  Both of us are avid outdoor people and hunters.  Growing up in the area we are both familiar with identifying tracks.  To us it looked like our own feet (bare feet) only much larger and wider.  I''m not sure of the size, but with an educated guess I would say about 1 and a half to 2 feet in length or so.  We started to think that someone had possibly come back in and done it as a joke, knowing we were in that area.  The problem with that is, the area is accessible by vehicle but only an ATV or snowmobile, as the trails, although sufficiently wide, are no longer suitable for regular vehicles.  We found no tracks coming in or out from any vehicle, nor did we find any evidence that someone had walked in on foot or otherwise, beside ourselves.  However, no person could have made such tracks.  The tracks came out of the woods on the right side of the trail, crossed it and dissappeared back into the woods on the left.  We ventured into the brush on either side and noted that they were consistent in both directions.  There were no human shoe or barefoot prints to be found anywhere.  What really scared us was the realization that the tracks were fresh.  We had passed that same spot only ten or so minutes earlier and saw nothing, so we had to assume that whatever it was, had passed behind us after we went through.  That sent chills enough through both of us to get us moving back out double time.!  I should also note that the width of the trail is about 6 or 7 feet.  There were only 2 footpirints in the trail itself, telling us that whatever made them, had a very long stride.  To this day neither one of us has spoken of this until now, when a friend referred me to this site.  I still question what I saw, but have never been able to come up with a reasonable explanation as to what it may have been.",

My car is damaged from the hood to the rear by this creature and I know it is at the least injured and its DNA may be on my car. The speed limit was 55 and I was not able to stop in time. When I saw the creature, who was carrying a deer, about to step into the roadway I hit the brakes but was only able to slow down minimally before impact. I did not really believe in Bigfoot before last night and I am still shaken up and have not been able to share this story with anyone. I wanted to stop and see if the creature was okay, but I was scared out of my wits to stop and get out of the car. The creature was huge, at least 7.5 feet tall. I''ve seen drawings and such of Bigfoot, and this creature looked similar, but had white around his hairline, and his fur was dark brown, almost black. I''m shaking writing this and I am in such disbelief that this happened to me. I can''t even report the accident to the police, and I don''t know what I will tell my insurance company.

    " It was in the afternoon on a snowy winter day.1985. My friend and I decided to go for a winter drive(which was very common for me when it snows).We ended up at the entrance to \"Ice Cave Mountain\". Of course the attraction was closed. But we wanted to go for a winter walk and thought it would be pretty secenery in the untouched snow covered grounds.<BR>We stepped over the gate and began to walk the driveway towards the woods. We were talking with eachother in normal voice tones. The snow was about shin deep so as we walked, we were looking towards the ground to step through the snow as we go. <BR>As we approached the woods, we both looked toward the woods to see the snow covered trees and scenery, when all of a sudden, it took us by surprise as much as we took him by surprise.<BR>It stopped in its tracks to look at us. It was if it froze in place. (You see, these grounds are not occupied at all during the winter, so it was totally unusual for us to be there)It looked at us as we were frozen in our tracks staring back at it. It was about 150 feet from us. It was very large with brown fur/hair all over it''s body. It was absolutely human looking. It was walking upright just like humans walk. When it looked at us, it didn''t react in any deffensive way. It just waited a moment or two as if it was waiting to see what we were gonna do.<BR>When I was finally able to speek, I asked my friend if she sees what I see. And with that movenment, it seemed to have been frightened by us and started to walk away very fast,but it didn''t run. It just had a very long stride. It looked back at us again while it was leaving.<BR>Now mind you, we were the only people in the area. But we were curious and stupid.We decided to follow it. But then again we were very scared. We attempted to try and find footprints but were unable to. Maybe because we were too scared to look properly.<BR>I know what I saw.

    " My sister and her two children, my wife and I and our two dogs went to Nuclear lake in Dutchess county for an overnight camping trip. We set up camp in a field next to the lake a few hundred feet off the applician trail. We had two tents and went in them to sleep around 11:00p.m. My sister was feeling uneasy so I sent my male dog to her tent to sleep with her and the kids. My older dog, my wife, and myself were in my tent. I turned the opening of my tent to face my sisters tent door so she felt less stressed. An hour went by and the kids my old dog and wife were sleeping. Suddenly I heard foot steps coming from the woods heading toward us. It was a very dark night but I saw no flashlight shine. Then my young dog in my sisters tent started to make this whine/growl and I could clearly hear a person walk behind my sisters tent, but still no flashlight shine! All the while my sister was awake and my young dog freaking out almost crying and he is a pitbull not afraid of any critter. I KNEW it was a bigfoot and told my sister not to worry because she hates the woods and couldnt sleep. The next morning she looked very tired and we only spoke about it a month later on the phone. She said she knew it was a biped and couldnt sleep all night. My wife, my two dogs and I are trail runners and twice a week do 6 mile runs on this section of the Appalacian trail. It is remote and rugged and I have Moose dropping on my fireplace mantle from that area and bear sightings are common. A few miles up the trail is a large beautiful swamp also. This is not my first time I had the feeling bigfoot was around. My wife and I are in the woods more then anyone I know. We hike and back pack all summer and log 25 miles a week in the woods trail running. I made a report a few years ago when we were hiking up Buck mountain when a bigfoot was smashing trees and making that loud click noise like I can do with my tounge but 10 times louder. I know a woman who had a daytime visual in st. lawrence county n.y. and I also know a man who had a visual in penn. when he was hunting deer. What is the real story on bigfoot. Are they so slick that no one can get a good picture or do they just scare people so much that the powers that be dont want the cat out of the bag. I wont go in the deep woods alone anymore and I was never afraid but now I am and hate that feeling. I''ll give my name and number and I sure wish someone would call me. thanks.",

That is also near the Carvel property, which is not too far from a stretch of the Taconic State Parkway (between Rt 199 and Jackson Corners exit). The truck was bouncing around while they did donuts, burning around in circles in the field. My friend stopped the truck for a minute and they were laughing with the inside light on. The head lights were on too. While the truck was at a complete stop, the back end of the truck started bouncing up and down like someone was jumping on it. They didn''t want to get out and see what was causing it. They put the truck in gear and peeled out of the field. This happened around the same time, and within a matter of weeks, of my sightings.",

    " In 1985, my friend and I were driving along Lake Rd in Pine Plains,NY. It was late afternoon in spring or early summer.  It was a wooded area with a few houses. <BR><BR>While driving we both saw what looked like a large man move from the shadow of a large tree and cross the road in 2-3 strides. When we got up to the spot where \"it\" crossed into the area of the tall grass near the tree line, I remember looking for the \"man\" in the area.  <BR><BR>I was thinking in terms of a peeping Tom, because the \"man\" didn''t walk along the road. He just seemed to materialize out from the tree like he had been standing in the shadow of the tree, next to the road, out of sight of the house. <BR><BR>When I didn''t see anyone in the brush/grass, I took note that the figure had appeared light brown when s/he stepped out of the tree shadow. I also realized that if I crossed the road, I would have to take at least 5 strides.  <BR><BR>Next incident was also late afternoon, a week or two later, in the same area (a side road near Stissing Lake/Stissing Mt). <BR><BR>Sitting in a car at exactly dusk, my friend saw a tall, brown figure standing along the tree line next to the road, the same side we were on. There is a large ballfield on our left side and Stissing Lake beyond that, to the west. We were facing north.  <BR><BR>When she said \"what is that?\" (she didn''t say \"who\"), I looked ahead and couldn''t make out what she saw until I saw a movement about 100 yrds ahead. That''s when I saw a light brown leg turn into the tree line and a tall, upright \"man\" walk into the tree line. We decided we didn''t want to sit in the car next to the tree line about 30 seconds after we lost sight of it. <BR><BR>We drove the car slowly up to the place we last saw it but my friend (who was driving) didn''t take her foot off the gas and didn''t stop. There was a small shed there in the trees that the ballfield uses to store equipment. It is about the size of 2 outhouses. It certainly could have been hiding behind it.<BR><BR>Both times, I can say that the tallness of the figures, using the tree heights as a baseline, were definitely well above 6ft. <BR><BR>",

    " I was driving on a backroad in Rhinebeck, NY. I was heading to a rehearsal at the Rhinebeck Center of Performing Arts at about 6 :30 in the evening. The road is called Pilgrims Progress Road. While I was driving on this road, I passed a 20 mph road sign because it''s a sharp right turn, but on the same road. The road is very curvy. I passed this turn, and in the middle of the road was a Hannaford bag with an open cereal box, and a log placed in the bag. I had to go in the left lane to miss the bag. As I passed the bag, something darted behind my car from the left. I looked in my rear view mirror, and saw this big, black thing right where the bag was. At first, I thought it was a bear because it looked like it was on all fours. I kept driving, looking in my rear view mirror. After a few seconds, it was out of my vision. I kept driving down the road until I pulled into a driveway on the right, and turned around to see what it was. As I got to the location where the bag was, I noticed the bag was missing. I kept driving for about 0.2 miles down the road, past the 20 mph sign. As I turned, I saw something walking on two feet about 50 yards in front of my car. It was walking on the side of the road. I could see that it was definitely not a bear. It was black, and it looked as if the hair was short. It''s back was towards me, and the shoulders were very broad. It looked like it was slouching, and I couldn''t really see it''s arms. I don''t know if it was holding something, or if it was the way it walked. I''m about 6''5\", and It looked like it was taller than me from what I saw. I saw it for a good three to four seconds, until it leaped up this little hill to the right. I sped up to the location I saw it leap from, and got out of my vehicle. I looked all around because there weren''t many trees. The grass was very high though. I didn''t see it after that.<BR>I was nervous, confused, and excited at the same time.",

    " Not an actual sighting. However, I recently read an article in the Post Star Glens Falls NY newspaper about a BFRO gathering in Whitehall NY. To begin with, I had never heard of your organization nor knew that Whitehall was a supposed hot spot for Big Foot sightings. Let me tell you my story, all factual. <BR><BR>My family and I have owned property in the Dresden NY area (off of RT 22, a few miles north of Whitehall) since the early sixties through last year when I sold my property (located on Blue Goose Rd, old RT 22) last year. Back in 1999 while deer hunting off of Pike Brook Rd. in the Black Mt. area, I viewed some very strange tracks in the mud on a logging road and suddenly an awful, foul smell was in the area. <BR><BR>It was a damp, still early November day, thinking back it may have been Election Day. The time was around 8AM as I hiked up the logging road. The smell drifted away as quickly as I smelled it but it was distinct. I''ve never smelled anything like it since and I have been with hunters that took Adirondack bears and this odor was different. It actually raised the hairs on the back of my neck, it was definitely a strange odor. The tracks were sort of footlike but very wide. The toe area was mushed in the mud so it was difficult to determine if there were claws like a bear or any other type of distinguishing features. In retrospect, I should have reported this immediately but the only person I told was my wife and a few hunting buddies. No one completely dismissed my story but it was like, oh, thats something but I know what I smelled and sensed and it definitely gave me the creeps. <BR><BR>I am interested in your organization and I''d be willing to go back to the area with someone involved with BFRO and take you to the site. Please contact me at T********@nycap.rr.com to  discuss. Thank You.",

    " It occurred on a sunny June 17, 2015 around mid afternoon while we were boating along the eastern shore of Lake George, NY, just above the Narrows. The object we saw was located at approximately 43 degrees 35.086 minutes north and 073 degrees 34.347 minutes west per a Google Earth view obtained on 5-5-2015.  We were about 140 yards away (even though it didn''t seem that far) and the bearing from us to it was about 132 degrees true, again using Google Earth to obtain distance and bearing.  This section of the lake is state property and part of the \"Forever Wild\" section of the Adirondacks.  There are many square miles of wilderness here and this location is only about 8 miles from the locally famous Whitehall, NY sightings in 1976.<BR><BR>We were motoring in our 19'' I/O boat northeastish in a narrow channel between Sarah Island, Hazel Island, an un-named rocky outcrop and the mainland.  Our intended goal was Fox Island, a short distance away.  We were traveling about 5 mph, slightly above idling speed, engine rpm would be approximately 1000.  There is a point of land opposite the rocky outcrop and as we cleared it, a small bay exists on our starboard (right) side.  Since I''m always scanning the lake side to side for boat traffic, at that point in time, I was looking to the east into the bay and I noticed movement close to the shoreline.  It seemed that whatever it was, was caught by surprise as we cleared that point of land.  I then got my wife''s attention, she looked in that direction and also saw it.<BR><BR>My view was of a very large black animate object that seemed to quickly raise an arm (?) from it''s side to a horizontal position then turn away and move back and to the side (north) behind a nearby clump of coniferous trees.  I then spun the boat around for a better view.  Meanwhile, my wife (Debbie) was watching it.  Her impression was that it was large, dark, upright and didn''t move like an animal.  Her view was slightly restricted by the trees but she did notice that the object was swaying from side to side.  The only (known) animal that is large and black out here in the Adirondacks is the black bear and we both strongly believe it wasn''t a bear (I''ve seen many bears in the woods).  It was an observation of very short duration but long enough to impress us.  Unfortunately we can''t provide any accurate dimensions or descriptions of physical details but even though we''re not sure of what is was, we''re sure of what it was not!<BR><BR>We then continued on to Fox Island which is about 200 yards from the sighted critter and only about 50 feet from the mainland and chatted for a bit.  Eventually we got the charcoal grill fired up and proceeded to cook a traditional meal of dogs and beans, of course with the appropriate condiments.  We do this on a regular basis on the islands of the lake.  As we were eating, we both had a weird feeling so we QUICKLY finished our meal, loaded the gear back on the boat and left or as some may say, got the heck out of Dodge.  We''ve never had that type of experience on the lake before and are not sure if the two events are related.  I''ve recently become aware that some folks have a theory about how our favorite mystery creature may use/communicate with infrasound which could explain that feeling we both had.<BR><BR>We returned to the area on July 6, 2015 by boat with my brother who is an accomplished photographer to investigate the mainland.  By then, the NYDEC had installed docks in that bay so we could tie up to and go ashore.  We went to the area where the critter was first observed and noted that there was a small, probably seasonal stream that flowed into the lake.  We searched for but did not find any tracks or other sign.  However I recently purchased a trail cam and plan to set it up in that area.  Preliminary testing has shown that the motion sensor is very sensitive and wind generated tree movement will trigger it.  I''ve got a few ideas on how to mount it but am still trying to come up with the appropriate \"bait\".   Got any ideas?<BR><BR>Also this spring (2016), I shared our occurrence with BF researcher Bill Brann who runs the Northern Sasquatch Research Society who was present during a public screening of a documentary called Beast of Whitehall, The Abair Road Incident that was made by the Ohio firm, Small Town Monsters.  He then mentioned that he had a report of an anchored boat by Fox Island that had rocks thrown at it at night.  It was probably the same bay which is quite protected from boat traffic.<BR><BR>Again, we both have had over 40 years of outdoors experience and are very familiar with Adirondack wildlife.  Debbie is a retired Science teacher and I''m a retired manufacturing engineer of medical devices.",

With that said I have been going there for 25+ years and am very familiar with all of the sights and sounds.  My incident happened a few years ago in the spring of 1999.  I was camping the last weekend of May with one of my dogs on the south side of Lewey lake.  I think there were maybe a total of 5 camps being used.  One of the nights around 10pm I heard a loud and very unfamiliar cry/scream come from the north side of the lake.  I sat there in silence with my dog, almost in shock because I had never heard anything like this before.  It went on with a series of screams for about 10 seconds.  It was not a bear, not a moose, etc.  It made me a bit uneasy as I could not place the sound.  It was not from any campers either as there were only a handful and were all on the same side of the lake as myself.  I just went to this website today and listened to some of the sound clips available of ''BigFoot''.  The sound I heard almost exactly matches these clips.<BR><BR>",

We foolishly figured it wuld be an hour up and and hour back and we''d be home by supper and didn''t take a flashlight. It took 2 hours up and the sun was beginning to wane. Now my husband had a habit of walking very fast sometimes out of my sight and I kept yelling, almost crying,\" Wait ,wait for me!\"As it got near dusk, the road was darker and darker and I finally grabbed and held on to his arm so I wouldn''t be left alone and behind. Then we heard something big crunching up the ground just off the road in the woods beside us and following along with us.If we stopped, it stopped. I couldn''t tell if it was one or more but I think just one. aAll down the Mtn until we got to where the road kind of levels out for at least an hour or more that thing was in the woods following.He figured it was deer or a bear but would those animals do that? Then recently when I read that teens on the bike trail near French Mtn thought they saw something in 81 or 82 or 83 I began to wonder.

    " while camping in the Lake Luzerne/4th lake area we heard several hoot-whoops on July 24th at approx 0130--200.prior to hearing these whoops, I heard something large walking approx 20-30 ft away from our camp. a distinctive \"cracking\" noise was made as if something very large either broke or stepped on a large branch these vocalizations were between 2, and possibly a 3rd animal. they were heard moving away from our area. I almost wonder if they were herding prey for hunting purposes. approx 02 hrs later I heard them again as they moved back into our area.I have heard these noises before and I immediately recognized the sounds as they are so unique.there were 7 people in our tent. 4 teenage girls (my wife myself and our 10 month old son.we all heard them and needless to say the girls and my wife were a little startled.

    " On June 10, 2006 I was driving with my brother on a back road (unpaved) in the Adirondack Park. We were heading for a trail head that led into the Hudson River Gorge. This area is almost dead center in the park and surounded by many mile of unihabited and very rugged terrain. <BR><BR>It was late morning on a clear day. I was driving as fast as i could on this road because we had to get back to town by a certain time.<BR><BR>As we turned a bend I saw a very large, brown, furry, object lunge into the dense woods up the road at the next curve about 50 yards ahead. It was obvious that the creature was in the road and was startled by my speeding SUV.  <BR><BR>I told by brother, \"Hey, there goes a moose.\"<BR><BR>We reached that spot in about 3 seconds, and i slamed on the breaks - expecting to see the moose right there in the bushes.<BR>At that spot, through the bushes, was a decent sized clearing and then more dark woods that went down a hill.<BR><BR>There was nothing there at all. Everything was still. We started off again and took our hike.<BR><BR>The more I thought about it, the more I thougth I just could not have been a moose.<BR><BR>First of all it was the wrong color - a light chestnut bown. (The color was very visible because the sun was shinning in the area. It was a striking shade against the ligth green of the brush.) Moose are never that shade - they are always a very dark brown.<BR><BR>Second, the size and shape were wrong. This thing was huge - at least 7 feet tall. And the shape was not like a Moose rump. The more I thght about it, the more it seemed like it was the upper back and head of something.<BR><BR>Finaly, if it was a moose, it would not have utterly vanished so quickly. My vehicke got to that spot in just seconds. Moose, at least the ones that I have seen, don''t tear off into the wood. We should have seen it in the clearing.<BR><BR>It wan''t a bear, either. Not even close.<BR><BR>I wished I had stopped to investigate further. Unfortunately, we were in a hurry<BR>",

They were \"sing song\" in pattern and unlike anything I have ever heard.  The creature appeared to by \"talking\" to itself as there was only one creature.  It did not sound angry and lasted for about two minutes.  The sound change in pitch and fluctuation.  I was not scared but did leave quickly.  I have since studied sounds of coyotes and found no similarties at all.  There were no yelps, barks or growls.  I can not duplicate the sounds.

    "      This was recorded very soon after it happened in our camp journal. It was the weekend of May 11th 2002.  My wife and I were at our seasonal camp on Lake George for the early season.  We had bed for the night in front of the fireplace.  There were only a few lights belonging to other early season camps across the lake.  It was a calm night.  My wife was sound asleep.  She often sleeps through thunder storms.  I was up throughout the night.  I was awake for the sound of the first scream.<BR>     The first cycle did not wake my wife unfortunately the second closer scream did.  Someting screamed four times in the distance.  Thirty seconds later it screamed again, on our property.  We have less than a quarter acre of land.  The time was around 2:30am.  Thirty seconds to a minute later it screamed for the last time in the distance at a third location.  <BR>     The scream was in an evenly spaced pattern of four screams.  Each scream was about three to five seconds apart.  The volume was that of human sized lungs.  However, there was no attempt to form words or partial words.  The scream did not change pitch.  It sounded much like a human female.  There was no sound of the creature crashing through the woods.  Please note that a few years back a similar sound was heard by a camp only five down from us.  Other sitings have occured very near to my camp.  The screams made the hair on our necks stand up.  Very frightening.  There have also been sightings of mountain lions in the area.  However, sounds of the mountian lion''s scream were not like the screams we heard.  <BR>",

    "  My brother and I were canoeing on Lake George, in N.Y state at about sunset. We headed south for 10 minutes to an area known as Deer Leap. At lake side it is a boulder strewn area with cliffs rising 600 feet above the shoreline. As we were begining to come on to this area we saw something standing on shore. It was brownish in color and standing straight up with it''s arms at it''s side. It was about the size of a small man and very thin. Its body was facing south, looking down the shorline when it suddenly turned its head directly towards us and looked very intently. We  whispered to each other and watched it while it watched us. We were 2 grown men paddling parallel to the shore and about 200 feet out but we could not summon up the courage to go in closer. This thing had a strange look, almost a crazed grin. Like a giant Lemur.  The sun was set now as we continued to watch it in the shadows of the mountain. As it was standing next to an old, dead pine tree, it turned and climbed, sloth-like up the tree about 20 feet to the first and only large limb and onto the crook of a branch. We paddled back around and as we approached it again cocked its head directly at us, after a minute or so it turned its face downward into its body and became as if it were a part of the tree. Just a lump on the crook of the branch. You would not know it was there unless you saw it move. I have been in this area all my life and have never seen anything like this and have not seen it since.<BR> In my searchings I have found reference to a creature found in the woods of New Hampshire. Back in the 30''s they called it the \"Wood devil or Stick Men\". The one thing incommon is they are able to blend into trees to avoid being seen.",

Late one night a girlfriend and I drove out to East Bay and stopped to talk for a while.<BR><BR>After a few moments spent parked near the bridge, I saw what looked to be a man walking accross the marshy area to our left.  The distance, I am assuming, was about 200 to 300 yards.  This I gauged by seeing a fence line at that distance. At the time my tested vision was 20/10 (documented). <BR><BR>We both watched as this man approached the fence line.  He cleared it without stopping.  Simply stepped over it as if it were a low stool.  Knowing that the snow was not that deep or that hard to support a man of his apparent size, and that it was highly unlikely for anyone to be out on the marshes at that time of night, I stepped out of the car to get a better look.<BR><BR>As soon as I had gotten out of the car, the man changed course and began heading straight toward us.  I closed the car door to cancel the interior light, and prevent showing my location.  At this point the man broke into a run.  His speed was incredible.  He closed the distance between us very quickly.  My girlfriend was screaming for me to get back into the car at this point.<BR><BR>I got back into the car, and she drove back over the bridge into NYS.  As we went, I looked behind us and saw that we were being pursued, although we were building a gap.  As soon as we returned to hardtop road, he broke off pusuit and ran back into the forest near the bridge.<BR><BR>We returned to town and never spoke of this incident to anyone other than two trusted friends.  I have since told friends and relatives that I saw \"something\" out there but could not say that it was any animal I had ever seen, nor could it have been any man.<BR><BR>I should add that at that time I had spent 16 years working and playing outdoors.  I had encountered all of the major predators of our area, knew their habits and habitats.  I know that I did not mistake an animal for a humanoid creature that night.  <BR><BR>I will further add that I am now a Natural Resource Scientist with 16-years of experience studying and reporting information based on my observations and analysis.  I still cannot state with precision what it is I saw that night.",

    " Bigfoot Sighting<BR>Date: Early August 2010<BR>Time: Approx. 8-8:30 am<BR>Place: Cascade Lakes, NY (near Keene)<BR>Weather: Clear with a few clouds<BR><BR>I spend most of the summers camping in and around the Adirondacks in my Dodge Caravan. This particular summer I had stopped at Cascade Lake to spend a few days camping.<BR><BR>I had slept soundly the previous night and had woken up around 7:00 am. I decided to get up and start making my breakfast. I had just started the kettle on the camp stove when I looked over at upper Cascade lake and could see the mist rising off the surface of the lake. I grabbed my iphone and walked about 50 yards to the edge of the lake to get a picture. As I approached the breakwall, I noticed a dark brown object on the opposite side of the lake at the shore. At first I couldnt make out what it was but it seemed to be sitting at the waters edge. I then realized that it must be a bear. The animal looked like it was doing something in the water with its paws as I could hear a faint splashing sound. <BR><BR>I thought it would be a good idea to get a picture so I brought my iphone up to face level and tried to focus in on the animal. As I was focusing in, the animal stood up on two legs. I was startled and pulled down my phone to see this with my own eyes. It took a step towards the treeline and stopped. Almost methodically, as it stopped, it turned its whole upper body to the left and stared at me for a couple of seconds. It turned back and in one step, disappeared into the tree line. I immediately went cold and got scared. <BR><BR>As I ran back to my campsite, my only thought was that it was going to go left or right. If it went right it would have to go into the water and if it went left, it was headed directly for my campsite. I decided that it was best to get the hell out of dodge so to speak. <BR><BR>I arrived back at my campsite in under a minute. My dog was still asleep on the front seat and didnt stir at all. I opened the passenger side sliding door of my van and started to throw all of the camping gear back into the van, making quite a mess inside as I did. I closed the door and then jumped into the drivers seat and floored the gas to leave. <BR><BR>As I was driving out, I kept looking out my left drivers side window to see if I could observe it again, but I saw nothing. I drove all the way into Lake Placid and parked at a mall parking lot to gather my thoughts and think about what had taken place. I was pretty shaken up as I kept replaying the experience over and over in my head trying to make sense of what I had seen.<BR><BR>Observations:<BR><BR>I could not ascertain its height exactly, because of the distance, but I would guess that it was approximately 7-8 foot tall. It was covered head to toe in shaggy dark brown hair or fur. I could see the sunlight shining off its back as it turned to go into the treeline and could see the brown coloration as it turned away from me. <BR><BR>When it turned to stare at me, I could not make out any facial features but I knew that it saw me. The upper body was massive and stocky like a football players build. It had very long arms that went well below its waist. I could also make out what I assume were the shape of hands. <BR><BR>It walked upright and paused before slowly turning its upper body to look directly at me. It stared at me for approximately 5-10 seconds and turned back to face the treeline. It took 1-2 steps and disappeared into the forest. <BR><BR>I could see a couple of branches move after it went into the trees. It was then I decided to leave. I did not hear anything other then the initial splashing it made in the water with its hands when I first thought it was a bear. <BR><BR>I did not return to the area until three years later with a friend to camp. Nothing has happened on subsequent trips to the area of Cascade Lake. I have had two other odd experiences in other areas of the ADKs on other trips. ",

    " I didn''t have an encounter exactly but we are owners of a camp in a remote region of the Adirondack Mountains.  This camp is only accessible by hiking to it.  There is rarely anyone ever around our camp.  We have found strange things that have occurred.<BR><BR>1) Fall 2002: We went hiking for the day  and when we got back we found a small pile of rocks at the back door that were neatly stacked with a stick coming out of them.  These rock were not there when we left.  They appeared to be deliberately stacked.  We understand that these could have been made easily by a human, but there is never anyone around up there.<BR><BR>2)  Fall 2003: One night around 7:30 pm (dark) my wife and I  went outside with 2 dogs.  We smelled something very strong and musty, like nothing we smelled before.  It wasn''t the dogs or anything we could identify.  The 2 dogs got very antsy and wanted to go inside right away.  This was very strange and freaky, these dogs are generally not scared dogs.  They also are large dogs about 80 lbs. each. We had never seen them act this way.  When we bring them out at night or day they run all over the woods this night they wanted nothing to do with that.  Almost like they smelled something that scared them.<BR><BR>3)  The same exact night as number 2.  I went outside around 9:30 pm to relieve myself.  While I was doing that I heard large heavy stomping behind me. The stomping was loud and heavy as if something was fleeing.  The strange part is it sounded like it made 4-5 bounds then stopped.  I heard nothing else after that.  I looked around a little but the happenings of this night made be uneasy so I went inside and locked up the cabin.  <BR><BR>I don''t know what did all of this and maybe it is easily explained away but these things altogether make me think it might have been a bigfoot.",

    " My family owns a home on Chazy Lake in the northeast corner of the Adirondacks.  I spend many weekends there and often wake up early on Monday morning in order to get into work (about 1 hour away).  In February of 2005, I had gotten up and left the house at about 6:30 am.  Approximately 2 miles down the Chazy Lake Road, headed toward the Town of Saranac, is where I had my sighting. A ditch (approximately 3 feet wide and 2 feet deep)runs along side of the road.  There was probably a foot of snow on the ground.  As I was driving, I saw something dark stand up from inside the ditch and head into the woods.  When I saw it, it was probably 150-200 yards in front of me.  It appeared to have a human shape but was slouched over.  I could not tell the height nor could I give an approximate weight.  The sighting lasted probably no more than 5 seconds.  I saw the upper 2/3 of its body which appeared to be dark brown or black in color.  I told my wife about it that night and we joked about it for a bit saying it must have been Bigfoot.  In all honesty, I thought I had either seen or bear or my eyes were playing tricks on me.

They both headed into the woods in opposite directions.  The ran quite fast slightly bent at the waist.  When we arrived at the point where we saw them, there was no sign of them.

    "   In August of 1996 myself and six friends were camping at Pine Pond in the lower Saranac Lake region.  It was around dusk and my friend and I were fishing in our canoe. The other members of our party were at camp preparing supper, about a quarter mile away through the forest from our location on the canoe in the middle of the lake. My friend and I were speaking openly, not attempting to be quiet in any way. I was scanning the northern bank of the lake, which I knew quite well, when I noticed a strange shape on the edge of the wood line. It was about 50 yards away. Immediately I pointed it out to my friend and he spotted it instantly. The shape was about 3 1/2 feet off of the ground at its highest point. At first we both thought it was a black bear standing broadside but after a few seconds I realized that was not the case. We started to row towards it somewhat cautiously.  Just as my friend whispered \"it''s a bear\" the thing stood up. It had been crouching there on its feet like a catcher from a baseball team. It was about seven feet tall and was very dark brown in color. Its face was hairy yet fleshy around the upper cheeks. Its eyes were dark in color but clearly visible and had a brightness about them.  Upon talking afterwards, we both agreed that we saw slight movements of its head and hands. It stood there for what seemed like ten seconds looking at us. It tilted its head slightly up as if it were sniffing the air. As if all this wasn''t strange enough, we then heard the snapping twigs about fifty feet behind it. The creature turned its torso to the left and looked to its side.  It immediately turned back towards us and then spun 180 degrees around and darted into the wood line like a cat. We then heard the sound of movement for about ten more seconds then we heard nothing. To this day I have no idea what made the noise behind it. After staying put in the canoe for about ten minutes my friend decided (against my wishes) paddle to the spot on shore and investigate for tracks.  There were only two discernable markings in the sand which were obscured from the pivoting of its feet when it turned around. The whole experience was very, very upsetting.  Although I can honestly say it did not attempt to threaten us in anyway it was scary as hell. That night I did not sleep one wink because I was so focused on every little noise that I heard. The next day we left.  The other people in our party are convinced we saw a bear. It was no bear.",

    " My memory of this is a bit foggy, as I was I believe seven when it happened and am 37 now. At the time my family was living in Cazenovia NY. I would often hike way out in the swamps behind our house with a friend to make forts etc. We would tear the bark off of dead elm trees to make paths for what seemed like very long distances. One day a friend and I were quite a distance out in the swamp chopping away at a rotted fallen tree with hammers when we heard a loud noise. Looking around we saw a very large, dark form that appeared to be a man walking through the swamp very near us. I will never forget the surge of adrenalin and abject fear that I felt. We dropped everything and turned and ran as fast as possible home without looking back. My parents were angry as I had left a hammer there. I refused to go back for quite a while until my older brother accompanied me. I didn''t think about this incident too much over the years until later when I have heard people describe bigfoot sightings in terms of ''It looked like a very big man wearing a black raincoat''. This is exactly the description I would give. I don''t know, it just seems odd. Why would a man have been alone out in a swamp like that and never said a word to us? Makes you wonder.",

    " I was driving from my grandparents house to my girlfriends house one night in early fall at about 10 pm.  The area I was heading to is up in Tughill plateau which is a very dense wooded area.  I was about 2 miles outside my hometown of Sandy Creek and had about 3 miles of woods to drive through to reach Boyelston, where my girlfriend lived. The road I was traveling on was very narrow with steep banks on both sides.  I had just made a left turn around a corner where the road begins to get steeper and head uphill for about a mile when I saw something beside the road out of the corner of my right eye.  I started to slow down out of instinct because people are always hitting deer around this area when this thing just jumped out into the road in front of me and began to quickly cross to the other side.  I slammed on the brakes and skidded to a stop, which gave me just enough time to see some of it in my headlights as it finished crossing the road and up the bank into the woods and disappeared.<BR>I only really saw it from the side and the back so my description isn''t really any different from any you may have heard.  It was somewhere between 6 1/2 and 7 feet tall and very strongly built.  Its head seemed to be attached to its shoulders directly because I couldn''t see a neck.  But it had very long dark hair, mainly black with patches of brown.  I can''t believe I originally thought it was a deer.",

    " This is a follow up to my original message as I wanted to add some significant insight to an incident that occurred to me in 1960 at age 14. As I stated previously stated I was a caddy at the time and the foursome I was with was just walking off the green of hole 13 on the private course Club in Syracuse, New York.  As I was walking across the green to replace the pin I heard something falling through a tree directly across from me. You could hear it pass through the tree as the boulder made its descent to the ground. The large rock almost hitting one of the golfers. There was much consternation over this and it was automatically assumed that it came as a result of blasting at General Crushed Stone located behind the golf course on Rock Cut Road. I never heard a blast but there could be no other explanation as large rocks don''t just fall out of the sky. However, the rock being hurled into the air by a dynamite blast at the quarry just doesn''t hold up in many ways. First off my friend''s father worked at the quarry at the time and he said blasting was not large enough to propel a single rock that far as the charges used to quarry the limestone were not that great. Plus this was a single large boulder if it was a blast there would be a shotgun type of pattern of smaller rocks with it, not just one rock sailing into the air. Secondly, the rock that I saw was not a freshly quarried rock which would be gray in color this rock was a surficial rock that was stained from the soil it did not come from a blast site. The boulder was at least 20 pounds in weight and 4\" by 8\" and 3\" thick. It was flat on the top and bottom and stained a yellow brown color as is common of rocks on the surface in that area. However, this rock came down out of the sky vertically as you could tell by the sound of it falling through the entire tree, cutting branches and leaves as it fell it had to have been lifted quite high into the air to come down vertically like it did. It did not smash into the tree on a horizontal trajectory and bounce off the tree. As I stated previously at the end of the game I met up with my friend  who lived on Rock Cut Road at the time as we were going swimming in the spring fed wash ponds at the quarry. The way to get there was to go back to hole 13 and cross the fence into General Crushed Stone property. We were trespassing which at the time we didn''t acknowledge.  We stopped and I showed my friend the rock that came out of the sky and both of us believed that it had to have been a blast at the quarry.  We walked on down a grade on a path and that is when we heard a guttural growl off to our left. It was a fearsome growl and I for one shot off down the hill as fast as I could go. We assumed it was an animal. However, what animal growls at a human when the human is not confronting it or even knows it is there? I don''t know of any and I certainly don''t know what type of animal living in Central New York would or could make itself know in a threatening manner. Normally animals of all type will shun and form of human contact or confrontation. This occurred no more than 100 feet from where the rock had landed under the tree. Plus if you were to place a clock face over the tree that the rock fell through and draw a line out from where the rock had landed which was between the 3 and the 5 those two lines would encompass the vicinity of where the growl came from. As I have stated I never saw anything out of the ordinary and was certainly not aware of \"Bigfoot\" or anything like it being seen in New York State. I had heard of the \"Abominable Snowman\" but that was worlds away. I can''t say this is a \"Bigfoot\" encounter, however, two events occurred that is very similar to what others have experienced in Bigfoot sightings. The large rock being hurled at individuals and done so to scare more than injury plus the deep growl the likes of which I had never heard before or since and couldn''t to this day equate it to one particular animal. The only thing I am sure of is two events separated in time by only a couple of hours still stand out in my mind these many years later as if they occurred today.  ",

    "      The incident occured in 1985-86 not sure which.  A friend and I went into the woods to stay the night in a cabin by a small creek that my friends brother had built.  The cabins floor was about two feet off the ground to prevent flooding.  It was about 11:00 pm when my friend and I heard someone at the door which we had locked.  Someone was trying to get in.  When we asked who was there, no one answered.  Whoever or whatever it was moved around to the side of the cabin where the window was.  All we saw was a shape in the window.  The top of the figures head reached almost to the top of the window, which I estimated to be some 8 feet off the ground outside.  We were terrified beyond belief.  We huddled in a corner not getting a wink of sleep all night.  The next morning we cautiously went outside to investigate.  The ground was frozen with patches of snow that were riddled with footprints from everyone the day before.  It wasnt until I crossed the stream that I noticed a set of footprints that looked like someone had walked barefoot up the side of a steep embankment that ran along side the creek.  I called my friend over to look.  The stride was to wide for either of us to make especially since they were going up the embankment.  We just figured that someone had come in the middle of the night to mess with us.  At the time there were snow shoes that looked like a big version of someones bare foot circulating department stores.  I guess neither of us wanted to believe that it could''ve been anything else.  To this day no one has confessed to trying to scare us that night.  It just makes me wonder.",

    " My unusual experience occurred during the first week of October 2005. I was scouting for deer in a very isolated and limited access area in upstate New York accessible by a 4 x 4 trail. I had scouted another area earlier during the day and had about 2 hours of good daylight left to scout this area. <BR><BR>My standard practice is to drive the entire length of the valley to check the parking areas as to see where other hunters are located before scouting. <BR><BR>On this day, like most during pre archery and archery season, I was the only person and vehicle on the 4000 acres. I turned around and headed back up the valley to where I wanted to scout. It was a nice sunny fall day but the sun was beginning to drop. I parked my truck, grabbed my backpack, and headed down a steep ravine into a creek bed. I crossed the creek and proceeded up the other side of the wooded ravine. There is a field at the top of the ravine that I crossed and a hedgerow that separated a hidden field on top.  I wanted to check some apple trees for apples. <BR><BR>On the far side of the hidden field is a large pile for rocks that appear to be the foundation of an old homestead. I usually climb on top of the rock pile because it is high enough for me to glass the entire field to the top, which is a couple hundred yards. I glassed the field and saw nothing, which is odd for that time of day but not unheard of. A deer trail crosses in front of the rock pile and heads into a marsh area with a thicket on the backside of the marsh. The thicket is a few hundred yards wide then breaks into a mature open hardwood where I wanted to scout for a tree stand location.<BR><BR>I was about halfway across the marsh when I heard a very loud, deep, resonating growl or roar. It stopped me dead in my tracks and came from the thicket I was headed into about 100 yards away. I have never heard anything in the woods in my 25 years of hunting like it. It was not a cat, coyote, dog, and I do not think a bear. I did see a very large bear the season before in this area at 20 yards but he did not make a sound when I waved him off. He just stood up and looked at me then turned and ran off about 50 yards before walking again. I had a rifle at the time and the bear did not see me until I waved at him. He was walking straight down the mountain at me where I was sitting on stand next to a huge boulder. One year I did spook a bear out of a small orchard and he kind of \"woofed\" at me as left the area. But this sound wasn''t anything like a \"woof\" it was more of a roar that lasted about 1 to 1.5 seconds. I was shocked and taken back by it.<BR><BR>After stopping dead in my tracks I spotted a big flat rock a few feet away. I climbed up on the rock and took my pack off. What ever made the noise was very large so I dug out my hunting knife and put it on my belt. I usually carry a sidearm when scouting but they are not allowed in this area. That day I wish I had one with me. I glassed the thicket with my binoculars but I could not see anything that could have made the sound. After about 5 minutes of looking, I wrote it off as a bear and decided to change direction and go check another field that is over the hill from the field I crossed to get to the marsh but at other end of that field.<BR><BR>I started walking up the marsh parallel to the thicket and to my surprise and shock; whatever was in the thicket was walking parallel to me or flanking my right side. I could hear it snapping limbs and twigs as it walked. This was something heavy at least the size of a deer, bear, or person. I never heard anything scamper or scurry in the leaves like a small animal will eventually do if you listen long enough. I could hear it busting through the saplings. At this point I decided to get out of the marsh and into 75 to 100 yard wide hedgerow and that runs between the field I crossed and the marsh. This also would lead me away from the thicket. I could not hear whatever was in the thicket after I got into the hedgerow.<BR><BR>I was about in the middle of the hedgerow on an old logging road that runs parallel to the field I crossed to get to the marsh when I ran across something odd. There were two trees about 20 to 25 feet in height bent completely over and parallel to the ground across the logging road. The trees were a good 4 to 5 inches in diameter. There was no obvious damage to the trees and the trees were alive with green leaves on them. I kept walking up the hedgerow and toward the field at the top.<BR><BR>I arrived at the top of the hill and top of the field I had crossed to get into the marsh. There is a hedgerow that separates the two fields. I glassed the second field for a few minutes and saw nothing. I had yet to see any kind of wildlife on this scouting trip. The sun was starting to get very low in the sky so I decided to start heading back to my truck. I knew if I followed the top hedgerow down the hill I would pass a couple apple trees and it would lead me to the top of the ravine. I kept following the hedgerow down the hill until I almost reached the top of the ravine. I stopped to check for deer sign around a couple of apple trees. As I was looking for sign, I heard a series of \"knocking\" noises coming from about the area where I crossed the ravine on my trip up into the fields. I would estimate the knocking was 200 to 250 yards away. It was not a woodpecker because the time between knocks was too long and it was a more dulled whack rather than a hollow sound a woodpecker makes. A woodpecker has an almost machine gun sound to it. I heard a series of about 4 or 5 knocks then 20 seconds later another series and then another series.<BR><BR>At this point, I got kind of spooked because it seemed whatever was in the thicket had backtracked me to where I had crossed the creek and ravine at the start of my scouting trip. The sun was starting to set behind the mountain and it was going to start to get dark quickly. I was literally miles from any main road or person and in the middle of nowhere. If whatever was backtracking me continued to do so, then we were going to end up at the same place, my truck. My original plan was to walk the top of the ravine back down to where I had crossed the first time because it is easier to climb back up the hill.  Well, that is where I was hearing the knocking noise coming from so I decided I didn''t want to get any closer to the source of the knocking. <BR><BR>I headed straight down the side of the ravine into the creek bottom. It much darker in the creek bottom and everything was in shades of gray. I stopped for a moment to catch my breath before I started up the other side of the ravine to my truck. As I was standing there catching my breath, I started hearing rocks landing on the rocks in the creek bed a couple of hundred yards downstream from me. I could not tell if they were rolling down the hill and landing on the rocks in the creek bed or being thrown. I could hear the rocks land on other rocks and roll around a bit. This happened 5 or 6 times.<BR><BR>After hearing this, I just headed straight up the other side of the ravine grabbing trees to pull myself up and got out of there as quickly as possible. I hit the jeep trail about 75 yards above where I parked. I made a beeline for my truck, dumped my pack in the passenger side and drove out of there as quickly as I could and the trail would let me. It was four wheel drive low range all the way out. I kept checking in my side and rearview mirrors for anything on the road behind me. I never saw anything on the road behind me.<BR><BR>Was it a bigfoot? I can''t say that. I can say that I have never heard a roar or growl like that in the woods. I researched the Internet on animal vocalizations but could not find anything that was an exact match. The closest match was a snarling wolf but it was not the sound I heard. I listened to the bigfoot vocalizations on this site and can not say that is what I heard either. The thing roared or growled once and it was kind of short. It startled me and I didn''t get a second chance to hear it. After reading some of the reports on this site, the unusual events that occurred that day match other people''s experiences. There are also reports on this site that are from the same area as I was scouting. I was back in the area again during gun season 6 weeks later and did not see or experience anything unusual. I usually don''t spook very easy and travel the backcountry alone quite often. I will admit, that day I was spooked by something.<BR>",

    "Since then, a couple other incidents might be worth a mention that I didn''t think of till hearing some of the \"vocalizations\" recorded.This last summer heard some sort of a light growl gutterly noise around the house. It was late mid summer and had the house all opened up for cool air. We live a ways away from people and could leave the house open at night without a problem. This noise creeped me out. I had never heard anything in the area like that before. I turned on all floods and spotlight flashlight around the house. I went outside and walked around the entire house spotlighting in hopes of seeing wha tmade that noise as it sounded like it was within 50 feet of the house. I found nothing.The year before in mid summer again I heard this \"howl\" that was bigger than any howl from any dog. We got a pond near by and it sounded like it came from the pound but I wanted to see this \"dog\". We''ve all heard big dogs bark and you know when the dog is pushing 100 pounds just by the sound of his bark amplified by size of cheast. This howl went right through me it was so massive. I''d have to say it was a 200 pound plus dog and didn''t put anything to it until I heard some the vocalization recordings. It was very similar to them. I couldn''t what it was now..... I initially thought dog but now I just don''t know. Whatever made it ...... well i''d say it was the biggest animal I''d ever heard in the woods EVER.Never heard anything like that before or since.",

    " I submitted this report, I thing back in october(i think) and did not see anything posted or had any contact and omitted my phone number as no one in my household has been told of this story but will resubmit fully.<BR><BR>I''m unsure of exact year but I had returned to the area in june of 2000 and I think it happened the following fall of 2000 or 2001. Me and a buddy(him driving) were out driving backroads spotting deer as it was near hunting season if I recall correctly. We often drove the backroads out here doing just that......spotting wildlife.<BR><BR>It was roughly around 1AM.<BR><BR>We were heading south on Foster Valley Road in Tioga county New York and approaching one of the main country roads(Day Hollow Road) and were within 1/2 mile of it......or there abouts, traveling about 30mph. As we were approaching the S''s we could see the approaching lights of an oncoming car. Their headlights would have shined away to the uphill side (east side) of the road and they might not have even seen the creature due to location, light direction and visible location in the turns. We passed the car at about the same time we passed the creature and the headlights kind of obsured my vision of the creature but my buddy was focused on it and says he was not so bad and he probably got a more vivid look than I did as i lost good clear vision due to eye adjusting to the oncoming glare.<BR><BR>The road is a bit windy and as your approaching Day Hollow there is a couple of slight switch back \" S \" turns. When heading south, right along that section there is a very steap bank at road edge to your right side with no guardrail and bank at it''s highest might be 15 feet and drops down to a slightly tree''d slightly open flat so to speak. A person could easily jump from the road and land in the flat it is that steap.<BR><BR>The S turns are just about as perfectly inbetween the two closest houses to the area. <BR><BR>There are NO street lights in that section and a very dark section it is.<BR><BR>Due to the direction we were traveling and location of the headlights. Well we could see \"something/someone\" standing right on the edge of the road but on the bank. This bank is extemely short and steap. I would think it be a challenge for any person to stand or climb that bank but here is what we thought of as a person standing right there.<BR><BR>It was DIRECTLY infront of us and we could see that it was looking at the other approaching car even though it''s headlights were not even close to being fixed on it. We spotted this \"person\" probably around 50 yards away so we had some time to try and focus.<BR><BR>Even though the encounter actually happened within a short time frame I can look back on it as if it was slow motion and is permanently engrained in my mind.<BR><BR>As we approached this creature we didn''t realize what it was or how big it really was till just after passing it.<BR><BR>The comments inside the truck were kinda humorous and no offense is intended towards anyone peron inparticular but kind of go along with the sighting. Now the location of this thing in relation to the road and time of occurance was quite quite a dangerous spot for a \"person\" and most people would have probably stepped back away from the road but keeping in mind one step back is about 6 feet down easy.<BR><BR>The comments as we approached were with some explitives and without being offensive here something like.....<BR><BR>Holy cow, what kind of idiot would be standing there dressed in all black hooded sweatshirt.<BR><BR>I don''t know but they better step back. <BR><BR>Damn it looks like one BIG woman(torso completely visible and appeared large chested with what I''d figure as breasts)<BR><BR>Ya and why she all dressed in dark with a hooded sweatshirt on(looking back on it now I''d give a smoked charcol dark grey)<BR><BR>Damn they better step back if they don''t wanna get hit(we actually slowed a bit due to oncoming car and passing at location of creature so we needed the full road and edge of shoulder to pass the car)<BR><BR>The creature seemed to be looking more at the other vehicle and didn''t turn to look at us till we were just about to hit/pass. She wasn''t maybe five feet from the side of the truck and I looked her in the face out the side window as passing.<BR><BR>At that moment we both got a decent look at her face. When she turned to look at us she kind of turned her torso and body with the head to do so.<BR><BR>She was obviously big and even though she was standing on the bank, i''d have to say that we saw about 5 feet of the creature from about waist to high upper upper on up and looking back on it now and knowing the bank that she probably had about 4 feet we couldn''t see below the bank edge.<BR><BR>Her arms wer almost to the level of the road.<BR><BR>As we passed and got a glimps of her face the comments continued and were something like.......<BR><BR>OH MY GOD is she butt ugly.<BR><BR>Ya she is, she had a pig face, did you see that snout of a nose(there was no snout at all but a large very wide open nostraled slightly upturned nose).<BR><BR>Man is she ugly, she looks like she got beat with a couple ugly sticks out here in the woods.<BR><BR>Ya she sure as hell has one hell of an ape face.<BR><BR>At that moment, with the ape face comment. both of us turned to each other to see the expression on each others faces as the realization of what we may have just passed WAS.<BR><BR>We did not turn around. we did not go back to look ...... I honestly didn''t want to.<BR><BR>The reason I say hooded sweat shirt is..... well we''ve all seen people with one on and we all know how they kind of have a pointed head where the hood is sown together. well she had the same kind of coned head. We didn''t realize we were looking at hair and not a sweat shirt. She had a humanish face but man for a human she was very very hampered in the looks department.<BR><BR>She was definitely what I would call breasted and large roundish belly and large torso and had to be all of 8 feet if not bigger.<BR><BR>",

    " My wife and I have had our farm near Treadwell, NY in Delaware County since the summer of 2001. The farm is above 130 mostly wooded acres (I don''t want to give the exact number of acres to avoid someone figuring out which one it is), with about 30 acres of fields, with a few trails throughout the woods. The property is bordered by probably 2,000 or more acres of continuous woods (privately owned), and countless more acres of woods and fields that lead all the way up to Canada by just crossing dirt roads, except for one major highway (88). I have had a fascination for Bigfoot since I was young, and read about reported sightings, etc., so I am keen to notice things that could be attributed to these possible creatures others might not notice. I say possible creatures because even though I have a strong feeling they exist, I have not seen one with my own eyes. The first thing that happened was not long after we got our place. We were sitting around a campfire we made not far from the house, when we began to hear the sound of wood being pounded against wood coming from what seemed to be our woods up on the hill. The distance up to those particular woods is probably 300 yards or more, but this sound was clear and strong. I told my wife what I thought it could be and she told me she didnt want to hear anymore about it because it frightened her. There was no other explanation that could explain that distinct sound to me though. I tried to duplicate the sound in the woods myself, but could get nowhere near the resonance that must have been produced to carry the distance I think we heard it from. On another occasion I took our dog out for his nightly walk, and heard a tremendous short howl/scream/yelp with a whole lot of modulation. It gave me a chill down my spine. It was just a huge sound. We have coyotes all around here and I have heard them make some strange sounds, but I have never heard that sound from a coyote. Whatever made that sound I would imagine had to be a pretty big animal. It did not seem far away either, so after shinning the flashlight along the edge of the woods, I hightailed back to the house checking over my shoulder often. Perhaps along this same line, my wife was out with the dog one early evening in the field, and this is the mildest dog you will ever encounter, it has only ever growled while asleep and chasing something in its dreams. My wife told me that she had never seen our dog behave this way, and it doesnt even pay attention to deer when it sees them anymore because it sees them so often. The dog was looking intently at something along the wood line and growling. My wife could see nothing, but the dog saw something that scared it. It may have been a bear, as I have seen tracks and sign occasionally? The last incident, and probably the most convincing to me are the tracks that we saw in our woods this past winter (2004). We have never been able to get into our woods in the winter because the snow has always been too deep, and the hill to those particular woods to steep. The snowshoes that we tried in the past just sunk in the powdery snow. We tried a new type on a snow with an ice crust and we were able to get into the woods for quite a ways. We came across a trail of two pairs of tracks going in a couple of different directions and meeting up again a hundred yards or so later that no humans could have made. I at first I thought the tracks could have been made by deer leaping, but the tracks appeared to be a two legged stride with one foot pointing a little right and one a little left alternating perfectly. I am 6 feet tall, and I took my snowshoes off to see what king of stride I could make, and I was about a foot or two short of reaching the stride of these prints. The prints were pretty old as they had been snowed on, so I couldnt see much, and tried to feel for features like toes, but could not say for sure that I felt any. They were quite long, but the snow could have melted to make them bigger? What struck us was the length of the stride though.<BR><BR>So, that is our experience to this point for what its worth. I only wanted to let you know that there could be something to these incidences. I would not dare ask my neighbors if they have had any strange thing happen, even though they are very good friends of ours. I find it ironic that they may have had more significant encounters and may be afraid to say anything to us about it. One neighbor did say they heard what sounded like a dear being attacked and screaming in the woods in the night. They have never heard anything like it, so that was their only explanation. One of them works for an environmental agency that I wont identify and spends a lot of time in the woods. <BR>",

I peered through the thicket and all I could see was the hump of its'' back as it pounded its'' head or shoulder against the tree.  It was large.  I was so very curious to see more that I walked up onto our mound so I could look down into the thicket.  I could not see it better but it must have picked up my sent or seen me because it ran toward me.  I could hear it running and growling.  It hit some downed trees and could not catch up to me....I heard it hit the trees as I was running to my back door.   I am not crazy.  I am an educated woman.  I know what I experienced.  I have contacted the DNR of Wisconsin from where I live now because I just have not been able to get the experience out of my mind...it haunts me.  The DNR said it could not have been a bear.

    " I witnessed a Sasquatch at about 225 yards distance for approximately 15 seconds, while it traveled around 75 yards along the back of a stone quarry near Middleport, NY in the Fall of 2002/September. <BR><BR>I stop there to look for deer in a large field behind the quarry that are always there and immediately noticed when I exited my truck a dark biped moving very rapidly through waist high field grass on very uneven rocky terrain. <BR><BR>It seemed to float through the grass as I could not see its legs due to the height of the grass it moved through. Immediately I noticed that it was completely the same color and it seemed to hold its arms at its side as it moved very, very quickly from left to right. <BR><BR>At first sight I thought it was a girl with very long hair but quickly noticed that it was completely the same color with no obvious clothes coloration and moved much too fast although at the distance I was I could not make out any actual features and at no time did it look in my direction, but I believe I startled this creature by pulling into the stone driveway which makes considerable noise. <BR><BR>As it crossed a path next to a corn field and angled slightly away from me I noticed that its glutteal area was somewhat lighter colored. The biped then moved directly into a standing corn field and was not seen after that time. When I say traveled very quickly, I mean it was really moving very rapidly but at no time did it seem like it was running as you or I would look if traveling at that speed due to fact that there was no discernable movement of its arms as it \"floated\" through the tall grass. <BR><BR>I am convinced that this was a sasquatch I witnessed as I have been an avid outdoorsman since a very young age, hunting, hiking and camping for over 40 years and very experienced with animals in the wild and I know what I saw that afternoon was remarkable.",

With the time being around 2:00am in the morning, there were no sounds of any traffic or industrial sounds. The weather was excellent; no clouds, not the slightest breeze. My girlfriend and I had turned in for bed at around 1:30-1:45 am. We were talking to each other, just little chit chat when we both heard a far off howl/moan! At that time of night and that there was no wind to disturb the trees and hamper what we heard, it sounded like it came from the south maybe a mile or a mile and a half. The sound started low and kept going up in pitch for about 5 seconds. We both looked at each other and said \"What the hell was that?!\" Now what really freaked us out is that it did it again, only at around 6-7 seconds! It was like, \"Ooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh-----\"<BR>   Now I consider myself an excellent observer with a very keen ear. I can hear things that most people either don''t, or just overlook. What we heard was NOT anything mechanical nor was it a whistle. It sounded like it traveled over some distance; not like it was down the street. I am very fimiliar with all kinds of traffic noises that are associated with small towns. Even before we had heard it, we both had noticed how silent it was for quite some time.<BR>   After the howl/moan, there was an echo. The sound went up in scale and didn''t go down like a siren or anything like that. It wasn''t a cry for help or a wolf nor any coyote (I have heard a coyote three times, once from only 200 yards)",

    " This was years ago. I''m 38 now, but when this happened I was 14. My father worked with a guy who had some prime property in Naples, NewYork. Being that I was 14, I was not old enough to have a hunters license. So my father let me go with him, and I had the task of pushing the deer to him.<BR><BR>We got to the property just before daylight, Dad went about 200 yards up the the road, and I went the opposite way, and went into the woods. It started getting light out, and I remember that it was real cold that morning. It had snowed the day before but there was only patches of snow on the ground. <BR><BR>I had been walking through some thick sections of brush and was getting tired. I was walking in a shallow gully with a 20ft ridge on both sides of me. I walked up the ridge (I believe) to my left. There was a large tree laying down, so I sat down with my back against it. I could see pretty clear, the whole area. I guess I dozed off for a bit. I woke up, hearing what sounded like a large branch had snapped. I looked to my right, and then to my left, but as I looked to my left (paning the view) I saw something on the the oppisite ridge across from me. There was this large dark figure just standing there turned my way. It had heavy fur like hair all over it. I could''nt make out a face because it had long tangled hair hanging down. Now this figure was maybe 30 ft away give or take. Being cold as it was, I remember it breathing through the hair in front of its face (that really creeped me out). I sat there up against that tree with my heart racing out of my chest, afraid to move. This went on for minutes, feeling like a lifetime.Then all of a sudden it took one step torwards me (I think it was its left leg).That''s when I jumped up, turned, and ran as fast as I could. <BR><BR>I remember, I had run into a high fence line earlier that morning, that took my some time to scale. Well I jumped through this area of the fence from total terror of what might be chasing me. I managed to get to the road and ran full sprint to the car which was a ways down the road. The car was locked. Thats when I looked around, but nothing was after me (thank god). I waited about 2 hours and finally saw my dad walking down the road. He was pretty upset with me leaving the woods as early as I had but I told him what happened, and what I saw, and he did''nt believe any of it. He figured I was just cold and tired making it up. <BR><BR>I had never even heard of bigfoot when I was 14. I didnt know what it was, but I know for a fact that it wasn''t a bear.This figure was dark brown but lighter colored around its shoulders and thighs. Its arms were, I thought, too long for its body. I figure it was at least between 7 to 9 foot tall. It had to weigh 4 or 500 lbs. at least. <BR><BR>From reading some of your articles, people have said it smelled bad, but I didnt smell any odor that I remember.",

    " Hi, in the end of Jan. 2003 my wife and I were spotlighting for deer and coyotes in Waterport NY.  We were driving my 4x4 truck through the apple orchards. The lane went through a large hedge row with a small stream in it. When we got to the other side we spot-lighted along the woods. About 75 to 100 yards there is an old spot they use to dump garbage.  There was something standing next to the old fridge. I have hunted these woods since I was a little boy and never had seen anything like this. Its belly was about the top of an almost 6 foot tall fridge. I know it was an animal because its eyes reflected in the spotlight. It looked almost like a bear standing on its hind feet but there is no bears in this part of the state. As we sat there trying to figure out what it was it started to turn and walk into the woods. Wince we didn''t have any weapons on us we just got the hell out of there.",

    " My family had moved from the city of Rochester to Wolcott, a small town about 50 miles east of Rochester in July 2003. We were living in an old farmhouse on approx. 77 acres of woods & creeks near Lake Ontario. This incident happened sometime between the 18th-20th of September. My sister''s birthday is the 20th and I recall a small group of family and friends were visiting the house for that occasion. My future-stepfather took a small group, including his brother, my four sisters, and a few other friends out for a \"tour\" of the property. I was not present, I had stayed behind at the house. As the group returned to the house, my stepfather lingered behind in an area of the property where a strip of woods runs between two fields. My stepfather was in the field closer to the house, we''ll refer to it as field #1. He noticed to his left something in the woods and turned to see a tall, white, hair covered creature standing just off the path in the woods. He ran ahead and told his brother, but did not tell the rest of the group. His brother rushed into the house to get me, telling me that something was in the woods and I should come see. I followed him outside where my stepfather relayed the story to me and the three of us walked back to the area of his sighting. As my stepfather showed me the spot where the creature had been standing, we all noticed that the creature was still present, but had moved further back, to field #2. At this point, the three of us were standing in field 1 and looking through a small strip of trees at the creature in field 2, maybe 200 yards away or so. My observations of the creature are as follows: It was approximately 7'' tall, covered in hair, white but with a dark area on the face, think and lanky, with a head that came to a slight conic shape. It was too far to distinctly see its face but there was a definite darker colored area where the face would have been. The creature was clearly observing us, as it paced back and forth, looking around trees, standing up taller, ducking down, etc. to get a better look at us. After approximately 45 seconds, the creature retreated to an area where we couldn''t see it clearly. I walked through the trees into field 2 to get a better look at it, but it had disappeared. The area where it had been walking was matted down, but there were no distinct prints. Judging by nearby trees, I estimated its height to be 6.5 - 7 feet. ",
    :environment
    "The environment is a large wooded area on the outskirts of civilization. At the time, my family owned approx. 77 acres of land, most of which was woods and fields. My family''s house and barn were approximately 500 yards from the sighting area. Lake Ontario is within walking distance (on a clear day it is visible from the sighting spot) and there is a large creek (Mudge Creek) running through the area. There is a vineyard across the street. There are other houses scattered on the street but nothing particularly close. The area is rather isolated. The nearest town is a 10-minute drive and the nearest highway about 15 minutes.",

    " First let me state I am a college educated person with two degrees.  One in psychology and one in fine art.  Like many persons who have had this type of unexplained experience, it has made a mark on my psyche that has been permanently etched despite the ridicule poured on me (by persons who in fact were not there). Scientifically one may NOT deny or affirm the existence of a thing about which we have little information.  For instance, in the 1600''s if one were to speak of electricity and television they would be deemed mad and a witch.  Now you read this by just such means as were previously thought non-sense.  We know it is fact now.  Some day, I believe, this rare ape will present us with irrefutable evidence of it''s existence like being a little too slow in front of a mack truck or something.  Enough of that.<BR>Here''s why you''re reading this...<BR><BR>In the winter of 2001 while surfing the net for images of \"western art paintings\" the BFRO web site popped up with Western New York Bigfoot Sightings.  I had to laugh.  You gotta be kidding me.  Then to make it even better there are these \"listen to the bigfoot\" wave/sound files to download.  So curiousity made me do it.  I''m laughing my butt off here.  So I hit play.  <BR><BR>Suddenly I shut up  -   I am in SHOCK.  My hands began to shake and the adrenaline glands almost blew my head off.  The sound of the \"howl\" is exactly what I encountered one evening the previous September of 2000.  So now I play the other \"scream\" file.  Alright, now I''m disturbed.  That too I heard within 100 yards of my home that same summer, about 5-6 times on different occasions.<BR><BR>I never had any thoughts about sasquatch before.  This gave me pause.  It suddenly gave me a flashback of living near the Tonawanda creek in upstate New York and seeing a large (12-15\") barefoot footprint in the snow along the creek/riverbank just upstream of the north pembroke hotel(magadore hilton,ha).  Barefoot in the snow ? What kind of a jerk does that ?  There were, I believe, four of us kids there.  I was about 11 or 12 at the time.  We often played in those woods however that day we had an uneasy feeling and cut our trip very short and went immediately home.  I thought maybe it was a bear track like a hind foot although I knew it was too human.  No one even mentioned Bigfoot, it was not something we ever talked about.  Now that memory is freaky.<BR><BR>And there''s more..<BR>I now live in the woods and am very comfortable here near Allegeny State Park.  There are literally thousands of acres of forrest surrounding my home.  I am comfortable chasing 350 pound black bears out of my yard, sitting in the woods and having coyotes walk by, hearing screach owls etc.  THIS sound was unlike anything I had ever heard.  Sometimes at the approach of archery season I need to convince disrespectful persons that no tresspassing actually means them.  This night I thought to encounter a coon hunter whose howling dog was moving towards my position down through the valley.  The sound wasn''t just right for a baying dog but what else could it be ???  Now at the time this howling started it was probably a mile off (more later) and at dusk/dark.<BR><BR> I have the pleasure of having a wolf-dog that is not too much pooch you might say.  Great animal, very mellow even when on walks at night and the coyotes start up yapping less that 100yrs away.  He just looks and say''s \"punks\" and moves on - nothing phases him.  This night he was like stone focused on the direction of the loooooong howl.( I get the creeps remembering it).  Never before or since have I seen him in that state even in the presence of black bears.  His ears were fixed and I had to drag him under protest back into my cabin.  I was afraid that he might attack an expensive coon dog when I confronted the ''hunter''.  So now the wolf is in the house and I leash up my german sheperd, grab a spot light and a very serious russian weapon.  I take off in the direction of this howl which I can tell is coming toward me and know there is a field which leads up into the woods near where we should meet.  I get about 80 yrds in that direction and notice that the howling is now going to pass above me in the woods so I redirect my course for a more appropriate intersection point.<BR> <BR>Normally my sheperd is pretty bloodthirsty which I do not encourage, just her nature.  Tonight she is cowering between my legs trying to pull me back home to safety.  I''m thinkin'' \"wimp dog !!!\" and she''s really making me angry.  I am looking for the coon hunter''s tell tale spot light in the tree tops or through the woods -nothing.  Meanwhile I have entered into the thick of the woods cresting an embankment of about 35 feet above the road.  Oh Boy !  That aint no dog.  What the ----- weapon''s up laser sight on - this is bad.  When you have an attack dog, a nasty weapon with o so many bullets and a spot light (which started to go out, thankyou very much) and you''re still scared.  You just make sure the safety is off and focus on that little red dot.  <BR><BR> The thing was traveling at such a speed through the woods it didn''t seem real.  I thought the dog had to be running but when I heard it from around 120 yards away on the same level, NOBODY could convince you it was a dog, wolf, coyote etc.<BR>  I don''t scare easy, that was terror.<BR>Still I never thought \"bigfoot\".  In fact I researched all the wolf sounds I could find and none of them matched what I heard the night before.  I thought that is why my critter was so interested.<BR>  I just chalked it up to a \"maybe wolf\".  A neighbor who is about 85% deaf and a true hermit woodsman (83 years old) asked ME if I heard \"that howling the other night\".  This guy could almost sleep through an atomic bomb. Another fellow who is a Korean war vet who saw too much action also told me about this strange howling he heard two seperate nights.  He stated that he intentionally stayed up one night to see if he could figure out what it was.  He said that he could never figure out the noise or creature that made it.  Understand that this guy has camped out in a tent or camper in these woods for over 15 years.  Frankly he''s seen or heard almost everything around here.  Yet another neighbor ask me about the noise.  Her first comment was,\"It seemed a lot louder than it should have.\"  Now know that she owns a kennel and is an accomplished singer musician.  Let''s just say she understands acoustics.  Incidentally there is a great deer trail just about where I believe this noisy beast to have traversed the valley.<BR>",

    " I saw one in Napoli, NY, by Sawmill Run Rd. It was October 2000. My dad and I were hunting turkey on state land we were walking slow and quietly stopping and looking around. We were about 20 yards apart and we were both looking SE. I turned slowly and didn''t see anything, but then did see movement in front of me. I pulled up my gun, ready for a turkey. It was about 20 yards away and I didn''t shoot. I didn''t know what it was. It was on two legs, all brown-red hair all over it and at least six feet tall. It took off running like a big guy, but swift. It ran down hill away from me and was out of sight. My dad was still looking the other way. I wish he saw it to, but he didn''t. ",

    " I live in the Western part of New York State.  My story concerns a hunting camp I belong to that is approximately 65 miles Southwest of Buffalo, New York and approximately 20 miles Northeast of Erie, Pennsylvania.  The area is considered rural with second growth forests.  My story concerns four separate incidents over a twenty-five year span.  Taken separately you can probably explain them away.  But, taken collectively leads me to believe that there may be more to it.<BR><BR>Back in 1975 (year is approximate) my uncle, cousin, and I where at the hunting camp.  I do not recall the exact time of year but it was either late summer or early fall.  Late one evening perhaps 10:00 or 11:00 pm we heard a very strange, powerful call.  My uncle, who was a excellent outdoorsman, could not identify the call.  To me it sounded like a cross between a bird of some sort and a bobcat.  As we listened, the animal was moving through the backwoods.  After awhile my uncle decided that he wanted to locate the animal making it.  <BR><BR>The area in question is sandwiched between a large swamp (that is very, very difficult to walk through) and a 50 acre lake.  This area becomes increasing narrower and animal would most likely pass through a narrow tract of land, approximately 200 yards wide, before crossing a road.  So he, my cousin, and I headed out in to the night.  My uncle took us to a field that sits next to the narrow track.  Here we waited.  The animal was getting closer.  When it was maybe 100 yards away it stopped calling.  We could not see it, nor do I believe it could see us.  We waited for sometime but it never called again and did not cross the road.  I almost forgot about this incident until very recently.<BR><BR>Fast forward to approximately 1993.  My uncle while out hunting in the same area as mentioned above claims he had seen a Bigfoot.  As he relayed the story I could tell he was visibly agitated and quite forceful in his conviction in what he had seen.  Now, I must tell you a couple of things about my uncle.  First of all he died in 1997, so unfortunately, I cannot question him further.  But, he was a excellent outdoorsman.  He had hunted small and big game all along the eastern part of North America.  When he has younger he would go to Ontario, every spring and fall, near James Bay to hunt bear and moose.  I would say he was very familiar with bear and their habits.  So, I am sure it was not a bear he had seen.  But, he also liked to drink whiskey and beer.  So when he told us he had seen a Bigfoot, I am sure all of us (including me) thought he must have been hallucinating.  However, as I think back about my uncle, even when he was quite drunk, I had never know him to makeup stories.  He certainly liked to retell his stories over and over again.  But, they were always factual and did not varied in detail.<BR><BR>In the fall of 1999 my brother-in-law told me, while cutting firewood in the same area, he had seen something very large.  He did not get a good look at it because it frighten him so much he hopped on his four-wheeler at left the area immediately.  At the time, my brother-in-law did not know of the my uncle''s Bigfoot story.  So, I was quite intrigued.  I asked him questions as to size and color.  But, he could only say that it was very large and black in color.  I did not follow up to investigate the area because sometime had past since the incident and he had gone back into the same area without seeing anything unusual.<BR><BR>Two months ago, while reading a media story that \"Bigfoot is Dead\", I came across the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization Website (www.bfro.org).  On the website are recordings of supposed sasquatch vocalizations.  As I played one of the recordings I almost fell out of my chair!  It was the same vocalization I had heard approximately twenty-five years ago.   The sight and sounds of that night so long ago came back to me in a flash.  It was this last incident that captured my interest and convinced me to purchase your book and to study this subject further.<BR><BR>I must admit though that I do have some issues with the possibility of a sasquatch living in the area.  1) there has never been to my knowledge any other sightings in the area.  However, according to the BFRO there have been an number of incidents south of area in Pennsylvania and one incident in the next county to the east.  2) the area in question, although rural, seems a bit too populated for one or more animals to avoid detection.  Even when an occasional bear wanders through it always seems to get spotted from time to time.  3) I too have hunted and hiked over the same area many times in the past thirty years and have never seen anything to suggest a large creature is living in the area.  4) the area supports a large deer population, but, I have never come across a deer kill in the manner described on this web site.  To be fair, although I raise these issues, I also have never actively looked for signs of Sasquatch.<BR><BR>Paul J. Mateja<BR><BR><BR>",

The best hope of solving this was the hair-like material we found at the site and subsequently sent to Cornell. I never got an official report back but I did hear that it was never identified.

''If it''s a hoax, someone did a good job...''<BR><BR>By Melanie Conty<BR>The Corning Leader<BR>--------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>Rathbone - Bigfoot may be stomping around town, according to people who found huge footprints, hairs and uprooted vegetation near an area pond, area residents suspect.<BR><BR>Officials at the New York state Department of Environmental Conservation and Cornell University are examining the findings, and said they do not know who or what they''re from.<BR><BR>\"If it''s a hoax, then someone did a pretty good job of setting this thing up,\" said Michael McKeon, a DEC spokesman in Albany. \"And if it''s not a hoax, then we''ll have to see if Bigfoot''s out there.\"<BR><BR>The prints were each 15 inches long, five inches wide and embedded at least an inch in the mud, McKeon said.<BR><BR>They were spaced over 40 inches apart and casts taken showed bunions on the feet.<BR><BR>McKeon said he didn''t believe the claims at first, but now is not so sure.<BR><BR>Nellie Ferry of 6788 Hardscrabble Road spotted the prints Aug. 9, when she and her husband, Joe, were fishing at a neighbor''s pond.<BR><BR>A few days later more showed up, and then on Wednesday more appeared on the pond''s other side.<BR><BR>\"I''m not saying (Bigfoot) is what this thing is, but we''re trying to get an idea,\" Ferry said.<BR><BR>\"The DEC said it''s not human, but it''s not an animal.\"<BR><BR>Neighbors in this rural area about six miles outside Addison say they are intrigued and a bit anxious about the situation.<BR><BR>They report hearing noises - and sometimes a stench - coming from the remote pond.<BR><BR>\"My daughter rides her horse up there,\" said one woman.<BR><BR>\"That''s our back yard. That''s why we live up here because we feel safe. Now, I don''t feel so safe.\"<BR><BR>Many of the neighbors don''t want their names used.<BR>\"People will think we are crazy,\" she said.<BR><BR>Friends and area libraries have been providing Ferry with books and videotapes on Bigfoot, who has been spotted throughout the United States since the 1940s. A narrator of one videotape claimed to show actual footage of his Bigfoot sighting. The animal was about 8 feet tall, 400 pounds and extremely hairy. Others on the tape said Bigfoot has a pointed head, red eyes and looks \"like the devil.\"<BR><BR>The species is believed to exist on fresh fish and vegetation, and there has been no evidence that it eats red meat. Wolves allegedly roll around on its footprints and are quite receptive towards its stench, described as a combination of sewage and musty, wet cloth.<BR><BR>Sightings have been in Alaska, California, Vermont, and Florida, and upstate New York, the last here in the Adirondacks in 1972. Believers say about 1,200 Bigfoot exist in the United States.<BR><BR>Ferry said whatever has been walking around the pond has pulled up cat tails and eaten their roots, and lately she has heard howling and other unusual sounds from the woods at night.<BR><BR>McKeon said he does not believe there is yet cause for alarm.<BR>\"It''s not something that we think is a real problem,\" he said. \"There''s no reason for people to panic.\"<BR><BR>This advice, however, did not calm Ferry. \"I am getting nervous over it,\"she said. \"I mean, I would like to see it to find out what it is.\"<BR><BR>",

    " While hunting with a friend on his farm during deer season this past Nov, we were walking the creek bottom to get up to a stand of pines at the edge of a small swamp on his property, after walking about 200 yards we stopped for a bit to listen and observe and maybe jump a deer crossing over, we were there about 10 minutes when we started to hear something above and just behind us, the creek bottom at that point has about 8 foot banks on both sides, we continued to hear the noices get closer, but it seemed to be going parralel to us on the deer trail. having spotted bear recently, we thought it might be one and hoped it would cross about 60 yards in front of us, we moved a little further up and the noises stopped, figuring the bear heard us we stopped, it was quiet for about 20 minutes when it began again, only more hurried this time. at one point I could see movement in the woods and at first thought it might have been a bear standing up, but it kept walking on the hind legs, it turned and came across the creek about 60 yards from us and we just watched it run across the creek and up along the power line on the other side, it jumped down the bank and jumped back up on the other side. We couldn''t get a clear look because of the pines and the fact it was really moving when it came across the creek, but it was no bear, we both have been hunting for a good 25 years ech and we agreed it wasn''t a bear or any other animal we have ever seen. we listened to it for about another 3 to 5 minutes going through the pines and brush, then the noises just stopped, we went up and back tracked it as best we could but lost the sign just the other side of his farm pond.",

    " Visual Report: My name is Alan Y. on about Mid-November 2012 I had a very unusual experience that at first kept me very mixed up, but always stayed in my mind until I started doing research.<BR><BR>It was about 2 to 3am in the morning. I awoke to go outside and have a smoke. The area of the town of Bath, NY is semi-rugged with hundreds of huge foothills. There is a vast amount of forest, lakes, ponds, wildlife and many state parks. Much of the land is posted \"no hunting\". The hills are super steep, so climbing or hiking is difficult. We rented the full basement apartment of a home. Our entryway was in the back of the home semi-underground. There was a deck over our entryway. <BR><BR>I am an ex-US Army Intel (Special Tasking veteran) who served in central America and the Middle East. I am telling you this because I am a trained observer and weigh out everything I see. I am super aware of my surroundings. That morning I went outside and lit up a cigarette. It was very dark this night and cool. Deer would constantly wander through and many times I could be 10 feet from a deer and be silent so as not to spook them.<BR><BR>As I lit up my smoke some movement caught my attention about roughly [140] yards directly in front of me to the East. A cinnamon brownish colored figure was pacing back and forth over and over. On each side of this clear cut there is a couple homes. This thing was at the far end by the next tree line pacing back and forth moving towards the last home and back again moving appx. North to South then back the other way. It was moving erratically pacing back and forth like it was confused or undecided if it wanted to go closer to the home.<BR><BR>As I looked at first, I thought it was a drunk person? But in all the years I lived there, I never seen anyone out there. As I watched what really caught my attention was it looked like it was floating across the ground as there was absolutely no head bob at all. The ground rose between myself and this entity and went back down on its side so I could not see the lower legs good. It kept on pacing back and forth for about 3 minutes. At the position I was at under the deck, in the shadows, I was not observed by this creature.<BR><BR>Im not a afraid of too much, but for some reason the hairs stood up on the back of my neck and I got into what I call (combat mode). I wanted to bellow out at this entity (Ahh) but something said do not do that. Around 3 to 4 minutes of this pacing, I turned my head for a second and it was gone. I got a fearful sense of where this thing went and had a feeling it may try to flank me around the 2 homes, so I went into the house and awakened my wife and said theres something weird out there.\"<BR><BR>I did not think of \"Bigfoot\" right away, because it was not the Patty type I seen on the P&G film. I also thought that they are in the Northwest, not really here in New York State. It was I believe 6-7 feet tall, a slimmer build. Wide on top and slimmer than Patty. More like a fine-tuned athlete than a body builder, long arms and an awfully long shaggy head of hair (which stood out too me, WEIRD.<BR><BR>The reason I even saw it was because there was a light on that home as he was pacing towards, that lit up it and some of the area.  Upon seeing it (after the fact), I realized that there was a hedgerow running parallel to it, and a large ravine behind that that ran into the woods. Across from this property was a road, couple mobile homes then a very step wooded foothill (small mountain).<BR><BR>For years this baffled me, and I could not get this out of my mind until I visited the BFRO website and seen at least 6 reports entirely around my area. Thank you, for having a website where we can get these things off our chest. <BR>",

    " I was bike riding at roughly 10:30 AM on Saturday, September 30th.  While riding on Marsh Road from Route 223 toward Chemung, I suddenly smelt a very rancid, decaying type of smell.  I thought what I smelt was a large roadkill, so I scanned the road to the right and left of me looking for a deer carcass or the like.  As I turned me head from right to left I caught a glimpse of large patch of what appeared to be brown fur about 15 -20 yards ahead of me and roughly six feet off the ground. The fur seemed to be moving back into the woods as though it was approaching the road and then suddenly decided to reverse direction.  Nothing had crossed the road in front of me.  I rode past the area where I had seen the fur and looked back into the tree-line for the white tail of a deer or to hear the sound of something moving through the woods.  I saw or heard nothing.  I then realized whatever I saw was VERY far off the ground, and probably not a deer.  It was about this time I also noticed a dog, chained in a yard across the road, that was barking in the direction I was looking and seemed extrememly agiated.  Being a pretty consistent bike rider I could tell too that the dog was showing not interest in me.  Taking into account what I did, and did not see, combined with the smell, I thought I may have had a sasquatch sighting.  I decided to ride further up the road, turn around, and ride back trying to notice the smell again.  The second time past the area there was no smell at all, which surprised me because it was EXTREMELY strong when I first rode through.  I can''t really claim a sighting, but it seems either I can claim a smelling, or at least a series of brief events (all of this probably happened in less than 10 seconds) that when put together point toward me running across something in the woods that doesn''t fit a schema of anything I have seen or noticed before.",

There was a work crew working on the railroad at the edge of our property. I noticed this large animal come-up out of the river. I thought it was a bear. My son noticed it also. It was dark and walked like a man. In comparison to the men on the RR tracks it 2 to 3 times larger than the men working. It had a large head that seemed to fall into the shoulder with not much of a neck. It had longer arms and a slight sway as it walked. The men on the RR were behind a hedgerow and would not be able to see the animal. It went around the bend in the river and disappeared. The next day I got to thinking about it and went down to the river to see if I could find any tracks. I went to the spot where it came out of the river. I was unable to find any tracks. I feel it came out of the because the was a trash build up of debris, tires and all sorts of things. Rather than trying to get through that mess it walked around. It think the animal was using the Canisteo river for a road out of sight.",

    " This account happened on the night of the lunar eclipse back in 2003.  I was camping with my friend Pete in NY up behind his cabin (about 1/4 mile up the hill).  It was about 11pm and we were both in our bags in the shelter we built. <BR><BR>Pete was already asleep... I was trying to sleep but couldn''t so I was poking the fire with a long stick.  I heard something coming down the hill (heard rustling leaves, etc) but figured it was deer coming down the game trail.  It is tough to tell where sounds come from at night and judge distance in the woods because it''s so quiet.... but I figured it was pretty far out (about 150 or 200 yds) moving to our left.  I heard some sort of popping sound like the trunk of a tree being hit with something solid or two 2x4s being smacked together and a few growls (kinda like a lion but higher pitched, kinda like a stomach growling)... I still didn''t really pay any attention.  I dismissed the popping as trees cracking and the growling to Petes stomach or a low volume snore.  Whatever this thing was, it circled our camp keeping the same distance away.  All I heard was the rustle of leaves or twig snaps.  I kept hearing the popping sound occasionnally but I still wasn''t freaked out.  The sound eventually stopped basically where it I started hearing it.  I starting thinking that whatever it was, it was a predator (showing stalking behavior)... I figured it was a bear, fox, or some other predator/scavenger that thought it was a good idea to leave us alone.  But then I started getting a really creepy feeling that I was being watched.  I thought my mind was playing tricks and I was imagining it...  but it got worse and worse.  I couldn''t hear anything definitive in the woods but was still getting creeped out.  <BR><BR>I could only see part of the woods because only part of our shelter is open... but I started looking around (from my bag inside the shelter, not walking around) and what I could see was lit up pretty well because of the full moon (after the lunar eclipse anyway).  I looked into a stand of trees and saw a really big dark spot... it looked like a broken off tree trunk darkened by shadow... in basically the same spot where the noises stopped.  I looked around the woods a little more and came back to the  same spot where I saw the tree looking thing... and IT WAS GONE!!  I woke Pete up so I could tell him what was going on... and so I would know I wasn''t crazy if I heard something again.  I was telling him what was going on when we heard the popping/thudding sound again... He loaded his gun (Pete has a permit to carry a handgun in NY).  <BR><BR>We got out of our bags and restoked the fire and I heard his stomach growl... really loud!!  He said, \"Man you must be hungry.\"  I said I thought that was his stomach and we just looked at each other.  We went to investigate where I saw the disappearing shadow thing and we made a lot of noise to scare off whatever it was (breaking branches, kicking at the leaves, talking/yelling to each other).  We looked around the woods a bit... I heard something up on the ridge keeping pace with us but moving away.  It didn''t run, just moved away from us at the rate we were moving toward it.  We stayed up for a little while longer and heard nothing so we went back to bed.  Pete was out like a light and I stayed awake just listening.  <BR><BR>About 30 minutes later, THE THING CAME BACK!! I woke Pete up as I heard it come down off the hill from the same direction it started from... it was making a truck load of noise banging trees (we think it actually pushed one over too). It growled a few times,  and it''s foot steps were really heavy... based upon how Pete and I sounded moving through the woods earlier, this thing had to weigh much more than both of us (I''m 6''2\" and 250lbs).  It came in on our left and walked behind our camp about 30-50 yds... We couldn''t see it because it was on the non-open side of our shelter and we didn''t want to pop out and provoke an attack.  It kept walking in the same direction and eventually was out of earshot but we figured that was enough of a warning. We packed up and went back to the cabin.  <BR><BR>There are many screwed up things about this.  First, I''ve been hunting for years and I don''t get spooked... Pete is ex-military and no slouch in the woods either.  But this spooked us bad enough to make us want to pack up the gear at two in the morning (leaving some of it on the hill) and come back to the cabin.  Second, two of us heard this thing so I know its not just my mind playing tricks on me... it was definitely there!!  Third, this thing was massive... It made a whole bunch of noise when it walked behind our camp (more than any animal I have ever heard) and it''s footsteps almost shook the ground.  But here comes the most screwed up part of the story.  I have hunted for 15+ years and know what animals sound like coming through the woods... I have heard deer, bear, fox, etc... just about any animal in NJ, NY, PA, and ME... and, ofc ourse, other hunters.  I can tell you with 100% certainty...  THIS THING WAS WALKING ON TWO FEET!!  <BR><BR>I checked the area the next day and found a large foot print in soft earth... about 3 inches longer than mine and about 2 inches wider (I wear a size 12).  I tracked the animal (or whatever) for a few hundred yards but only found one other definate track and it was the same size roughly.  I also found a dead tree that was knocked to the ground probably the night before (fresh earth on the roots, leaves under/around it disturbed)... I presume it was the large crash we heard the night before.",

    " It was during 1997, late summer or early fall and my mother and I were visiting my Grandmother upstate. It was about 10pm and we were sitting outside on the back deck looking at the stars and listening to the night. We had made sure all the outside lights were off so we could see the stars better. My mother was sitting on one of the benches facing the house, and I was sitting on the steps facing the back yard. It was so dark, I couldn'' see more than a foot or two beyond my own feet.  We had been out there for a little while, and had not been talking, so it was pretty quiet. Suddenly, from about 20 to 30 feet down the yard, there was the strangest noise I had ever heard. It was kind of a cross between a scream, grunt and a donkey brey, not overly loud, and lasted for about 5 seconds or so. A second or two later, it started again, only closer, so I jumped up to go in and turn on the light, but accidently let the door close. When I got the light on, nothing was there. I grabbed a flashlite and scanned the yard, but saw nothing. Mom and I just looked at each other and ran into the house! The next day, I went to where the noise had come from, but saw no evidence that anything had been there.",

We were about 1/2 the way down the trail, in a clearing that had woods on one side and a swamp on the other side. All of a sudden we both hear what we thought was an animal or something running through the woods, when (what we believe was a ''bigfoot'') ran across the path we were walking on. It wasnt brown like we would have picture bigfoot being, it was more like grayish-white. It appeared to be around 6-7 feet tall.

AND AS I SAT THERE I COULDNT HELP BUT THINK ABOUT THE \"BABY BIGFOOT PICS TAKEN FROM A TRAIL CAM IN FOREST COUNTY IN 2008\" IT MADE ME FEEL A LITTLE UNEASY, BEACAUSE I BELIEVE THESE CREATURES EXIST AND I''LL TELL YOU WHY.<BR><BR>ONE MORNING IN LATE NOV.1988 I WENT DEER HUNTING NEAR MY HOME IN CLAIRTON. I DROVE DOWN RAVENSBURG BLVD. AND TURNED OFF TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD JUST BEFORE THE RAVENSBURG<BR>BRIDGE AND DIRECTLY ADJACENT TO CLAIRTON PARK.<BR><BR>I DROVE ABOUT 100 YARDS DOWN A DIRT ROAD TO THE BASE OF A VERY STEP AND HEAVILY WOODED HILLSIDE.IT WAS APPROX. 05:30, IT WAS CLEAR AND VERY COLD, NEAR PITCH BLACK. I EXITED FROM MY VEHICLE. I OPEN THE REAR DOORS TO RETRIEVE MY GUN AND OTHER HUNTING EQUIPMENT.<BR><BR>AS I TURNED AROUND I HEARD A NOISE APPROX 20 YARDS IN FRONT ME AND TO MY RIGHT. THERE WAS A HEAVY THICKET THERE. ALL OF A SUDDEN I OBSERVED I VERY LARGE VERY BROAD HUMANOID SHAPE RISE UP FROM THE THICKET. THE MASSIVE SHAPE DARTED TO THE LEFT IT MADE UP THE STEEP HEAVILY WOODED HILL SIDE IN A FEW SECONDS AND WAS OUT OF SIGHT.<BR><BR>I WAS STUNNED,SHOCKED AND REALLY NOT SURE WHAT HAD JUST HAPPENED. I WAITED FOR IT TO GET LIGHT BEFORE I ENTERED THE WOODS. I SAT IN MY DEER STAND FOR THE REST OF THE DAY WITHOUT INCIDENT.<BR><BR>I DONT USUALLY TELL THIS STORY BECAUSE PEOPLE THINK  I''M JUST MESSING AROUND WITH THEM. MY WIFE DOESNT EVEN BELIEVE ME. <BR><BR>IVE HUNTED AND EXPLORED THESE WOODS SINCE I WAS 12 AND I HUNTED IN THIS SAME SPOT A FEW TIMES  JUST LAST SEASON. IVE DONE SOME RESEARCH ON YOUR WEB SITE A SAW ANOTHER INCIDENT AROUND THE SAME TIME A FEW MILES FROM MY INCIDENT. WHEN A WAS A KID ME AND 3 FRIENDS WERE WALKING THROUGH THESE SAME WOODS WHEN SOMEONE STARED THROWING ROCK AT  US FROM A NEARBY HILLSIDE. WE JUST FIGURED IT WAS OTHER KIDS SO WE THREW ROCKS BACK AND CURSED.<BR><BR>THESE ARE NOT BIG VAST WOODS THESE ARE LARGE PATCHES OF STEEP HILLS AND HEAVY THICKETS.<BR>BUT I READ ABOUT OTHER LOCAL INCIDENTS ON YOUR WEB SITE. <BR><BR>",

    " My name is Amanda and I live in Plum, Pennsylvania.  On july 23rd, I was sitting out side talking to my boyfriend of nine months, Tommy.  I heard some moving in the woods beside our house, but disregarded it as a wolf or a bear or something like that.  I continued talking to tommy for about another 20 minutes when i smelled something strange and happened to look up and see a figure in the middle of our field that appeared to be about 8 or 9 feet tall.  It was very large and was covered in dark brown to black hair from head to foot.  It''s face was part human, part...something else.  I jumped up in fear, ran into my house and immediately locked the doors and shut the blinds.  My family was wondering what was wrong with me, they all said that i was \"as pale as a ghost\".   My mom went out and shone a flashlight around, we saw nothing else that night.  The next morning my cousin and I woke up and went outside to investigate.  We found flattened grass and 3 clearings in the woods and tracks that led deep into the woods.  We were going to go into the woods, but both of us were to frightened by what we had already found to venture off into the woods.  that was the scariest moment of my entire life.",

The interviewers seemed to be trying to connect the bigfoot sightings with UFO sightings in the area. This was all in the 70''s and 80''s.

    " A friend and I were sitting down on a pipeline right of way. We heard a noise that sounded like something that a large bird might make. A little while later, we heard something that sounded like someone knocking on a tree with a piece of wood or something. These sounds continued alternating, off and on for about 20 minutes or so. I remember that my friend and I were talking about how the sounds were a little strange, and getting louder. At one point, I realized that the sounds were coming from a point very close to us, and they seemed to be coming from the same place, so we stood up to see if we could see anything. <BR><BR>It was then that we saw the animal. It looked at us, we looked at it, and we all took off running. Before running, I noticed that what I was looking at was about 7 feet tall, relatively the same proportions as a normal human, except for longer arms, and it was covered with shaggy (2-4\" long) grey hair. The face was not clear to me. I have slight astigmatism and I could not make out the features at the distance of about 20-30 yards. <BR><BR>The animal crashed through the woods as it ran away- just breaking down everything in it''s way. I kept looking back as I ran, and it just seemed to be going in a straight path up the hill towards Sample Road. <BR><BR>Some years later I visited a wax museum in Niagara Falls and at the end of the exhibit was somebody''s idea of a bigfoot. It looked very much like the one that I saw, except for the facial features. This one had big pointy teeth and looked pretty angry. I could not clearly see the face of the one I saw, but I don''t think it had big pointy teeth and an angry expression.<BR><BR><BR>",

    "      Well, my younger brother saw it when he was around 8-9 years old, in the late ''70''s. <BR>     Our home was somewhat isolated and had  woods all around it.  We  played in the woods a lot.  He told me that once he saw \"Chewbacca\" standing in the woods watching him.  Over the years he heard weird noises coming from the woods when he was walking down the road, like screams and grunts that were almost like words.  He describes them as \"chanting\"  or sing song.  <BR>     Also, while by myself in a field beside our house, I heard a very frightening noise coming from the woods at the edge of the field; like growling and snarling  coming from somewhere behind the trees.  I saw nothing, but the best I can tell you a very large animal made those noises. Since the noises were loud I could tell the direction they were coming from easily and it was way above my head from the tops of the trees.  I never heard any animal before or since that made a noise like that. Being around 10 or 11 years old, I didn''t hang around to check it out, but later I told my brother and he related to me about the time he saw \"Chewbacca\".  Then one of us wondered out loud, \"Was it Bigfoot?\"  To this day, we don''t know.",

    " I HAVE AN AUDIO TAPE OF THIS EVENT, IT HAS NEVER BEEN HEARD BY ANYONE OTHER THAN A FEW NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS AROUND THE TIME THIS HAPPENED.   It was a fall evening, I was doing homework at our trailer, which was 1/2 mile from where my dad was building our house. He would get home from work around 4:00 and work out there till 10. One evening he came flying out the road in his truck and pulled in the driveway, then ran to the trailer asking my mom for the tape recorder. I was curious and asked him what was going on, he said that there was something in the valley fighting with a dog. So I grabbed my coat and wanted to go see, he let me go with him, but told me to stay in the truck, I didn''t listen and tried to follow him. So he told me to stand by the cows feed trough, which was near the house at top of field. He grabbed a wooden club and put the tape recorder in his shirt pocket and started walking down the hill towards the noise. I remember that when this creature growled, it shook the ground where I was standing, about 200 yards away. I was scared, and even more scared for my dad, who was now about half way to it. Another weird thing was that the 6 head of cattle we had were standing head to head in a circle at the edge of the woods. It took my dad about 5 minutes to get to the woods, where this creature was fighting a dog, you can hear the leaves crunching under every step he took. But when he got nearer it was too dark in the wooded valley for him to see the creature. So he returned back up the hill. The entire time that the recorder was on, you can hear this earth moving growl along with a dog fighting with it. Oddly, our neighbors dog (HENRY), who came around a lot, was never seen or heard from again. My dad wouldn''t let me go near that valley for a while, but eventually I was allowed to go down there.  And when I did, I looked around the area I heard the battle, and found a bunch of deer hair and bones scattered around a 20 foot area, But no (HENRY). Back when this happened I was about 8-10 years old, and didn''t think of looking for hair samples or DNA, or even footprints. Looking back, I wish I would have thought of all that stuff. But I do still have the tape recording, I really want someone from the BFRO to take this tape and get it transferred to digital. Everyone of our neighbors listened to this tape, and no one can say what it is for sure. I told my cousin about this event a few weeks after it happened, and her eyes got big and told me that one of her friends and her mom seen some big creature walking through a field below their house. The thing that made me wonder if it was the same creature is that her friend lived no more than 4-5 miles from me.

    " This occurred when I was about 15years old, but I remember it as if it were yesterday. <BR><BR>When I tell the story, even to the friends that were with me the night it happened, they laugh. \"I know what I saw and I would gladly take any sort of lie detector test made to prove it.\" <BR><BR>It happened around 9:30 p.m. in the summer of 1969. My friends and I had found a way that we could sneek into the community swimming pool after hours. We would peel back a small section of fence surrounding the patio and we would crawl through it.<BR><BR>We would swim, sometimes naked, for hours at a time. Occasionally the caretaker would come around to check the pool and when we saw him coming we would run through the fence and into a small patch of woods that ran along the Monongahela River.<BR><BR> On this particular evening, I noticed the headlights of a car coming toward the pool and sounded the alarm.<BR><BR>As I was the first one to enter the wooded area, I ran as fast as I could to gat away.<BR><BR>As I was running, sometimes looking over my shoulder to see if my friends were following, I ran into something. <BR><BR>This is where the strange event happened. <BR><BR>As I fell backwards, I looked up to see what appeared to be a man like creature staring back at me. <BR><BR>Although this figure was manlike in form, it happened to be around eight feet tall. It was covered in a long hair like element from the head to the feet. It also had an unforgettable smell. <BR><BR>As I got to my feet I turned and ran in the direction from which I had come. As I passed my friends, who were running into the woods, I screamed at the top of my lungs,\" Don''t go that way, there is somethong back there and I ran right into it.\" <BR><BR>One question that always arises is the fact that it was dark and we were in a wooded area. I can''t recall if the moon was bright that night but the lights from the park and the near by homes made this particular area fairly bright. <BR><BR>My friends say I ran into a tree. I asked them to show me the scratches, bumps and bruises that a tree would surely leave on my face and body. Although they were sceptical, none of these brave souls would venture back to where I had just been.<BR><BR>We lingered close to that pool until the caretaker, whom we called Lighthorse (just a name that we had given him) left the area, then we all returned to our homes. <BR><BR>Most of us lived within 1/2 a mile from the pool and many of us lived along the Mongahela River. One of the friends that was with me that night was my brother, Joe. He remembers the nights but he stil laughs when I mention the happening.<BR><BR>Laugh if you must but this story is absolutly true. <BR>",

    " I picked up my uncle from work. We were traveling down Rt. 66 towards Delmont. We were traveling up the hill where the rvs are sold on the right hand side near the gas facility. I was driving at 45 MPH When my uncle says \" what the hell is that?\" I asked what he saw and his reply was \" what ever it is it was walking on two feet. The sighting was quick no longer then 5-6 seconds at a distance of 70 yards on a cloudless moon lit night.My uncle said the subject was walking up the steep embankment that is covered in almost a foot of snow and bare of trees or brush behind the rv building on a horizontal path on two legs towards the woodline on top of the hill. He described the color as a uniform black. With no distinguishing clothing. The size he said was at least his size maybe bigger. my uncles is 6''4\" and 250 pounds and he even said it was the size that caught his eye. We can''t think of any reason a person would try to traverse such a steep incline or even going to the top of the hill cause there is nothing but woods once u reach the top. My uncle said it was spooky because he couldn''t think of any reason either. I laughed and jokingly said it was bigfoot and with that my uncle started rambling about even if it was. No one would believe us. So I am contacting u to see if you guys could maybe solve this for us.",

    " My mother, brother, and I had recently moved to a secluded community on the outskirts of land known as White''s Woods. We moved in September, and it wasn''t until that summer that strange noises were heard. In July of ''96, at around 2:30am, no earlier than 2, never later than 3am, strange whistling could be heard from the woods at the fringe of the neighbourhood. It sounded like \"whooooOOOPPP, whooooOOOPPP,\" with the rise at the end of the whistle. It was a very high, shrill sound. My family and I are not outdoorsman, so I assumed it was a bird. It happened always in the early morning, several hours before dawn and always from the same location. We simply assumed it was a bird.<BR>     The following year, from July to August, always at the same time and in the same location, the whistles could be heard. This time, branches could be heard snapping. I went to school at the University of Pittsburgh. On campus, there lives a peregrine falcon, and I was lucky enough to see it take two pigeons, and there was a commotion when this happened. Assuming an owl took a rabbit, I took these occurances as eery yet explainable. However, what happened the following year is what gives me pause.<BR>     My brother and I, having put up with these sounds for two years, thought we would investigate if anything happened the third year. Sure enough, at 2:30am, in July of the third year, the whistler returned. My brother and I are fit men. He was 28 at the time and I was 30. We play a lot of baseball, so we grabbed our bats and headed out. there are no streetlights in the area. And once outside, the whistling seemed to fill the air. It was very loud and quite easy to pinpoint. About 100yds from our house, something was whistling amid the brush and trees. The height of the sound was about 7ft (high off the ground yet discernable to know it wasn''t coming from the trees). My brother and I investigated, baseball bats in hand. About 25yrds from the whistling, something strange happened. The whistling continued in it rhythmic, rising cadence, but as we approached, something growled underneath the whistle. I don''t know how else to discribe it. The whistle continued with a growl at the same time. The growl sounded wet and we were so close we could actually hear it take in air. The whistle growl sent us, baseball bats in hand, running for home.<BR>     The whistler returned the following year, but only once. We did not investigate. It hasn''t returned since. After the pre-emptive investigation, it came back only rarely. And now it seems to be gone.",

    "      In 1985, I was attending Indiana State University in Terre Haute, IN.  One Saturday morning I was travelling to Chicago to visit relatives. I was driving north on U.S. 41 and I looked to my right down into a small valley (more a depression in the land than a valley) with a small stream running through it. About 100-150 yards from the highway, I saw a large dark-colored creature walking away from the road (to the east.) It was very broad and I could clearly see the creature''s arms swinging. My view of the bottom part of it was obscured by tall grass and I could only see the very tops of its legs. The head never turned at all. I saw this for 4-5 seconds before the trees on the north side of the depression obscured my view. There were also trees on the south side. My immediate thought was that I didn''t really see what I thought I did. I continued driving, unsure of what to do. After a few minutes, I turned around and drove back past where I had seen it (my view from this side of the highway was blocked), turned around again, drove to the bridge where the sighting occurred and stopped where I had originally seen it. There was nothing there at this time. Not being aware of any sasquatch sightings in this area (or the Midwest in general), and not knowing what else to do, I continued on to Chicago and didn''t think much more about it for many years.  <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>  ",

Then I can see in the moonlight movement with the foot steps crunching the leaves. It was definitely on two feet.  Then it stops. All of a sudden a loud bang off the tank. I think it had to have thrown a rock as loud as the bang on the tank was. Then more footsteps leaves crunching even closer now.

It had to have seen me at this point sitting there. As I tried to get my composure I reached down in the door for my handgun. As I looked back up I could hear it walking off in the leaves.

    " On the opening day of antlered deer season in 1982, my father, a family friend, and myself encountered a strange figure walking towards us in the pre-dawn woods.  This occured in state forest land in North-Central Pennsylvania.<BR><BR>There was about 1/2 foot of snow on the ground, but the temperature had risen all night, leading to fog and drizzle by dawn.  We had just walked about half a mile down a logging road towards our spot.  We were catching our breath before ascending a steep hill when we noticed a hulky figure approaching, walking upright through some fallen timber that covered a beaver swamp in that area. <BR><BR>This figure was dark in color (no red or orange hunting clothes), carried no visible equipment (including a flashlight--its ability to navigate through the terrain in the dark was an immediate signal to us that something out of the ordinary was going on here), and did not answer our attempts to communicate. <BR><BR>It stopped about 50 feet away from us, looked in our direction, than headed back from where it had come.  Our reaction at the time was that this was probably the dumbest hunter we had ever seen, but in later years (especially with some reports of Bigfoot sightings coming from PA) we wonder who or what it was.  There is no doubt for any of us that this was not a bear.",

We were sitting in the middle of a dead-end dirt road, surrounded by a small farmer''s field, small lake and very thick woods and hills.  We heard a horrible screaming  coming from the woods next to the field, about 50 feet away.  We all jumped up and immediately shined out flashlights in the direction of the sound but did not see anything.  The night was too dark and our beams too dim.  The girls got scared and ran into the cabin to hide.  My co-counselor and I stood outside for about a 1/2 hour listening to the screams, which came at intervals throughout the entire time.  I have never heard anything like it.  It sounded like something screaming in death.  I cannot describe it; it was a very large sound.  I am an outdoorsperson and know the sounds that most animals make, and I had never heard anything like that before and had never heard anything since, until I was browsing around on your website and discovered your recorded sounds.  I downloaded the most recent scream (not the howl) and it sounded exactly like what I heard that night.  I listened to it over and over again to be sure that it was the same sound and although I am not certain what it was that we heard that night, it certainly is the same scream.  We heard it for only about a 1/2 hour that night; there were no answering screams.  I heard a similar scream about a week later from a distance away.  This time I was alone.  ",

    " This story was recently told to me second hand in confidence by a very good friend of mine.  He is an Eagle Scout and an honorable man.  We are avid sportsmen and had spent alot of time together and with other sportsmen in the woods of Pennsylvania.  I told him of my interest in the Florida Skunk Ape.  I asked him if he or any of his family had ever heard or experienced any bigfoot encounters.  He told me that it was ironic that I asked because I was present when his experience occurred.  We were in Boyscouts at the time at a fall campout with our Troop, we were in the same Patrol.  Our Troop was playing \"Capture the Flag\" around dusk.  We were camping at a place called \"Hell''s Hollow\" near the Greenville Sportsman Club out on Route 358.  He and another Boyscout went out in the woods to hide.  While they were hiding in some brush, they pushed a Bigfoot that rambled out of the brush and away from them at an alarming rate of speed.  He said it definitely was bipedal and was huge.  My friend stated that he was scared to death and that they made a promise not to tell anyone for fear of ridicule.  He stated that he has never told anyone the story.  I couldn''t get any details as to the size or scent.  He did state that he did not see its face.  I told him of my intent to report the story and he said he would discuss it if contacted by the BFRO.<BR> ",

I jumped up just in time to see a large brown figure going into the woods toward a stream behind my house. She said it ran from the neighbors down a powerline and was snapping off sumac like they were twigs.  Being young and curious I ran about 75 yds to the spot the animal had entered, there was a small drop off of about 20 feet then a level spot about 10 ft, then another 4 ft drop to the creek bed. When I arrived I observed the bigfoot at about 50 yrds, It must have heard me as it stopped and turned its upper torso and looked at me. The animal was between 6 and 7 ft tall with a dark face, after looking at me it made great strides down the creekbed and was gone around the bend. When my father arrived we went to check the area. There were very large heel prints in the top of the bank where the animal had landed when it leaped off of the top. I hunted those woods for years and there were times that I felt I was being watched, We heard vocalizations one night but my father said it was a bobcat, after hearing bigfoot recordings I believe they are what made the noise.

    " I was returning home from a NFL football game that I had attended out of state.  It was about 8:45pm. The road I was traveling on had a lot bends with patches of woods on both sides, broken up by houses every so often.  It is a back road that connects two towns.  The posted speed limit ranges from 10mph to 45mph.  I was traveling at about 55-60mph on the straighter sections(I was trying to get home, I had been driving for a couple of hours).  This is where it happened.  One of my good friends was sitting in the front with me.  We had the radio up loud and was singing and staring straight ahead. Two more of my friends where in the back seat talking.  As I came around a bend into a straight-a-way, with woods on both sides, something caught my vision just in the edge of the headlights(high beams).  I saw the mid and lower torso, and legs of what appeared to be a person.  It appeared to be crossing the road. I saw it take a right and then left stride and then it went into the trees on the right side of the road.  I vaguely saw the color, it was a light brown.  When I first saw the movement I thought it was a person going into the woods, this is the movement it had, however it glided with great speed.  It happened so quickly, I thought that I had imagined it until I looked at my friend sitting next to me, he was staring back at me, this made the hair on the back of my neck stand on end.  I asked him if he \"seen that\" and he yelled \"yeah\".  I had slowed down to about 40mph with the intent to stop(not really knowing what to do) when the two in the back seat yelled \"whats going on?\"  I said, me and (name of friend) saw something, and the two in the back told me to keep going, they did not want to stop.

    "Since this, I''ve been doing research nearby. Many encounters happened in this area and west through Venango County. Since this, I have met a person who believes he has been having encounters while camping in this forest. I have seen pictures of tracks made approximately 10 miles from this location. When you talk to the local folks, they will tell you about these creatures. However, nobody is doing any real research there, so it stays fairly quiet. I did contact the rangers station headquarters in Warren Pa but have never heard back from them.",

    "Nothing heard. I didn''t smell anything odd either like I''ve heard happens often. There was rock throwing, which is what got my attention. No growling or noise from the creature at all. It was almost a peaceful, curious look to it. I actually did not fear for my life until it moved backwards into the thick forest. That''s when I took off.",

    " I have debated whether or not to report my encounter to the BFRO or any organization. I don''t know why, but I guess I wanted to keep this experience to myself for a few years and then it just didn''t seem to matter as far as reporting it. But now, I realize that all encounters need to be in a data base somewhere. These DO exist and when that day of discovery happens, this database will house many of the answers.<BR> <BR>My encounter happened in early June of 2010. I took a friend to the Marienville/Timberline ATV trails northeast of Marienville, Pennsylvania in the Allegheny National Forest, to ride ATVs for the day. Allegheny National Forest covers approximately 515,000 acres or 800 square miles of protected wilderness in North West Pa. The forest is pretty dense in most spots and has many types of terrain. From my understanding the Allegheny National Forest is one of the least densely populated areas east of the Mississippi River. Surrounding the Forest are more woodlands and farm country. <BR><BR>The 2 trail systems we were riding that weekend join together and make an approximate 60-80 mile loop from the northern end down to the bottom, and then back up the other side of the loop. My encounter happened on our return back up, heading North. I remember it rained very hard the night before and through the early morning because my friend, who was new to ATV''ing, didn''t bring rain gear. We had to go into town to buy him some cheap rain gear and then headed up to the trail.<BR><BR>It rained the first half hour or so of our ride and I remember the sun coming out and it was turning into a really nice day for a ride. For those that ride ATVs, they know that the rain makes mud, which is much more fun to ride in than dust. A few hours into the ride, having stopped and observed some beaver dams, some very old oil wells, a couple logged out areas where you could see for what seemed like miles and other cool sites that the forest has to offer, I was getting in more of a hurry to get back - it was approaching the end of the day. My buddy was way behind me so I decided to stop on the trail and wait for him. I usually don''t separate from atv buddies when riding, but this part of the trail was an abandoned logging trail and pretty easy so I rode ahead awhile and then decided to stop and wait for him. He didnt ride fast or dangerous; he \"putted\" so I knew he was safe, just slow. If he didn''t shown up I would turn around and meet up with him.<BR><BR>I wasnt sitting long. I just took my helmet off. Thats when I noticed rocks kept hitting the front right side of my ATV. They werent large rocks, maybe about or just smaller than hand sized. It took a minute or so before it occurred to me that I was stopped and that rocks should not be flying through the air and hitting my atv. I was turning my head towards the right to follow the path of these \"air rocks\" as I called them, when my turn stopped. I noticed this Stump which turned out to be a dark figure, approximately 70-90 feet away, that appeared to be in a sitting or crouching, or just a low position, then stand up into an upright position. Ill never forget how it seemed to pop right up like it was on a spring, with very little effort.<BR><BR>Initially I looked at its hands because I was interested to see what was in its hand, if anything. It was much taller than a normal human  best guess at this point would be 7.5 feet or so, and absolutely NOT a bear.<BR><BR>It was VERY broad at the shoulders. Almost freakishly broad  I remember that very well. It was on 2 legs and I could see its right arm hanging down, which was on the left side because it was facing me. I remember wanting to watch its right hand to see if it was armed or what it might be doing. That is funny to me now, because for some reason I assumed it was right handed. It moved its right arm to a slightly bent position, stopping with its hand in front of it, at about its waist. Its left arm stayed hanging to its side  very long arms.  It was all very dark black  a shiny black  from head to toe, or as far as I could see to its feet as it was standing in 1-2 foot tall grass or taller. As my eyes made their way up on the creature I could see its head was all black as well. There was no white or lighter color that stood out, like most animals would have on their face. I could not see clear details of the face as it was all black as well but it did not appear to have hair on all of its face. It appeared to be black skin - the same color black as its hair but I could tell it wasn''t hair in some spots. I noticed that the eyes were black, or very dark and deep, with a pronounced brow ridge. I could obviously tell it had a face. I just couldnt see defined detail of the lips or anything as it was all the same color. The lips were closed though and in a straight line across its face, not open mouthed or smile or frown  just straight lips.<BR><BR>The hair was short to medium length and not shaggy. Id say the hair was an average of 3 to 5 inches long, shorter at the head.  It was almost groomed in appearance but I think its from the hair being short and thick. At least that was my impression. Oddly, I did not notice any mud or dirt all over it, which seemed odd because it had rained hard the night before and didn''t stop until several hours before this. The trails were muddy. Almost as soon as my eyes were at its head and face and I was trying to zoom in and get a better look at the face, it began to leave. It didnt turn and walk away, but rather it stepped straight backwards into the brush and the trees and not take its eyes away from me. It stayed square to me as it was moving backwards. This all happened in the span of no more than 30 seconds, from the time I noticed the rocks hitting my ATV, up until it moved backwards. When I play it over and over in my mind, it seems more like 30 minutes. At this point an overwhelming fear just filled my mind, and I remember feeling like I shouldnt be in this spot right now. I dont remember shaking in fear or anything like that, but I felt warm and almost like I was going to puke. So I hit the gas and took off.  I wish now that I wouldnt have just fled, but the feeling that came over me was not like Id experienced before. I had my smart phone/camera in my fender bag and it NEVER occurred to me to get it out and start video. I honestly couldnt move for a short period of time.<BR> <BR>I have been surprised by people walking up on me in the woods and have hunted all my life, so animal encounters, even bear from a distance - do not scare or alarm me. I was in the military for 6 years, and actually had the honor to serve as SEAL TEAM 4 and SDV TEAM 2 (the old UDT TEAM 2) support, as part of a special warfare boat crew. During that time, I had many highly anxious experiences as one could imagine. To summarize, I am pretty observant, I dont have a tendency to over-react and I dont scare easy. I am very level headed and definitely not crazy. I didn''t instantly think \"Bigfoot\" as I wasnt a REAL believer then. At least I doubted their existence in the Eastern US and if they existed it was only in the Northwest US, Canada or Alaska.  This encounter took my emotions to places they had not been or at least had not been for a long time. It has been going through my head for over 4 years. I didn''t tell anybody except my fiance within the first year after the encounter.<BR><BR>Now - quite a few people know. The person I was riding with that day just found out in 2014. I never told him about the story before, but because I couldnt remember if it was springtime/early summer or late summer/Fall when this happened. I asked him what week if he remembered. When he told me it was springtime / early summer, he naturally asked why  whats up? I told him what happened. It turns out that he believes in these creatures too. He then realized why I was acting so weird when we finally caught back up with each other, and then on the 2 and a half hour truck ride home. Now I wish I would have told him then. Maybe we could have joined together and gone back to look for signs or whatever we could find. Instead, the overwhelming feeling of What the heck was that, and I cant tell anybody-they wont believe me anyways took over, and I kept it to myself.<BR> <BR>Nobody has to tell me what I saw or didn''t see. I knew what I saw. I saw a large dark figure with hair that could throw rocks (and very accurately), stand up within 100 feet from me, in a large dense forest where there aren''t any cabins or people just hanging out.  I still do leave the option open for an extremely large man (larger than anyone I have ever met) in a heavily padded Gillie suit with hair on it standing about 100 foot from the trail just waiting for someone to stop in that exact spot so he could throw rocks at him and take a chance of getting shot (most folks on ATVs will pack a handgun when riding in deep woods. At least that''s my experience). Now thats being sarcastic, but trying to make a truth out of what happened. Of course that option is slim, but it will always be there as I didn''t walk up to this thing and shake its hand or hug it, so being 100% sure it was a Sasquatch just isn''t possible. I am at 99.999% sure though. I do know that a fear like Ive not felt in a long time, if ever, took over me for awhile. Something told me to go, to move on, that I shouldn''t be here right now. Again - I am a very rational person and this just didn''t make sense to me at all.<BR><BR>I eventually plan on returning to that general area, on ATV and parking the bike and doing some walking. I just need to look around and feel comfortable with that. Ever since my encounter, I cannot put this down. Ive been researching since and came across various online groups that discuss encounters. I want to learn as much as I can before returning and looking around and I want to go armed with more knowledge than I have now.<BR><BR>UPDATE: I have returned to this trail (5 1/2 years later) and found the area this happened. It was strange being there.  Some of my biggest questions since learning more about these creatures are What was it doing there, close to used ATV trails and Why did it draw my attention to itself? If it hadnt thrown rocks I would not have looked and if it hadnt stood up, I probably wouldnt have even noticed it. Someone told me that maybe it was travelling and recently crossed that trail. The reason for rock throwing and drawing attention to IT was possibly to draw attention to it on purpose so my attention wouldnt go to something else nearby less able to protect itself. I interpret that as young ones. That NEVER crossed my mind. Just to realize that one was in the area blew my mind away and made me start thinking differently about what could be out there. Now, there may have been more? Ill never know that for sure, but it does make sense to that question thats been bugging me. I now wonder if there were young close to me, maybe they were throwing the rocks being mischievous. It is still hard for me to grasp that anything could throw rocks from approximately 90 feet away and hit the same general area  very, very accurate. If it wanted to harm me, it would have beaned me in the head and I wouldnt be writing this encounter.<BR> <BR> I''ve since been researching an area about 25 miles west of this location. I went from not caring or thinking about Sasquatch to a full blown enthusiast. I attend conferences and have actually received an invitation to Beachfoot in Oregon in 2016.  For this years Ohio Bigfoot conference, Sybilla Irwin (a BFRO member and artist) is doing a drawing of what I''ve described to her, and will be unveiling it at the conference. All of this is exciting, and I cannot wait to see her bring this back to life, and return my emotions back to that 1 minute of my life that changed how I think now. I cannot attach that picture yet as the Ohio Bigfoot conference director has asked not to put it out there until after the conference. But if you would like, I could come back to this and attach the drawing, which will be as close to what I saw as possible. also - for more info on this, The guys from Monster X internet radio contacted me and asked if I would come on their show. They saw my encounter on a group. I agreed and did a 2 hour show with them, discussing this event. Google MONSTER X Dave Groves. I am not looking for any type of notoriety out of this. It''s why I haven''t put up a report. But they found me and asked, so I agreed. I feel that folks need to know about this and that these creatures DO exist Anybody who knows me will tell you I am a very honest person. It is one of my strong qualities.  I know there are many made up hoax bigfoot stories out there, but I can assure you that this is NOT one of them. I wasn''t out looking for a bigfoot that day. I did not ask for this encounter to happen. But it did, and it changed many things about me. I stopped hunting deer and have not hunted since that day. I now cannot put Bigfoot stuff down and even started a bigfoot book collection with some very old and hard to find, autographed bigfoot books. This doesn''t happen to a person overnight, unless something occurred to change them. That day certainly did change me.  ",

    " My 7year old daughter and I decided to take my girlfriend out camping on the 4th of july weekend of 2007.My girlfriend had never been camping before and I wanted to give her the full effect.<BR>   I live in Warren Pa and that is in the Allegheny Forest. <BR>   We decided to camp out near the resivior by the Kinzua Dam. That first night, we were alone. Onebody near our site for atleast a quarter mile or more. Kat(my daughter) fell asleep and the two of us sat up and chatted. Off behind the tent, about 100 yards maybe closer, I heard a thud like a stick smacking a tree. Our yorkshire terrir heard it too. Then it was louder, more distinct like a base ball bat hitting a tree. My girlfriend was nervous, I could tell. I told her I had heard such a noise on a tape of Big Foot. She didn''t like that I said that and got alittle scared. I told her it would be ok and that whatever or whoever would not come near the firelight. She still was uneasy. We heard it for about 15 miinutes as it got further away from us.I thought I heard a weird howling too but I just chalked it up as a coyote or wolf. Though I have heard big foot howls and this did sound similar. I still wasn''t sure. All in all I figured it was telling us that this was his place and that we should not be here. <BR>  I had to lie to my girlfriend so she could sleep and said it was most likely a skunk or racoon. Though I know niether of those could hit a tree like that.<BR>   The next morning, I decided to look around and went out into the forest about 75 yards or more from the camp. I could still see the tent through the trees.<BR>  I found afew old logs broken over.A few trees in the distance looked bent over as if someone had done it by hand(typical sign of big foot markings) but I never told my girlfriend. We stayed another night there but we had very noisy campers about 80 yards up the road trying to fight with another camper about the noise they were making. <BR>This was last year. Now, I went on google earth and was looking at The Kinzua Dam In Warren Pa. I noticed an orange dot near the dam just passed it to the east I believe. I clicked on it and it said 1999-10-?? I tried the link and WHOAH!! was I excited... A big foot sighting right there!!! I loved it. <BR>   I am thinking on going back to the same place to camp this summer. Just myself, my girlfriend, my daughter and our dog. I love it out there. even if it does creep my girlfriend out lol.. There is something about big foot that makes me want to hear or see more. maybe even capute it on film or video.",

    "        In 1991 my mom had a polebarn built on some property she owned in the country. This particular weekend my brothers and sisters and their families got together for a picnic. It was around noon when we arrived and started setting up the tables and preparing the food. My one brother had purchased a moped that was in exellent condition which he kept there for anyone to ride. After about an hour I thought I would take my son for a ride. He was 3 at that time. <BR>We were the first ones to ride that day.<BR>       I thought that it would be a good idea to ride back in the woods since I like them so much.<BR>There are parts where there is mostly good size trees, and there are areas where there is alot of<BR>tall saplings. though those are up toward the front of the woods. We were back there about 15 minutes When I heard the most GOD AWFULL scream I''ve ever heard in my life. The kind that will make the hair on the back of your neck stand on end. The first time I heard it, it was quite some distance away but still very loud. Being that the moped was like new it was very quite, and at times you wouldn''t think it was runnig. The second time I heard the scream it was alot closer.<BR>I''d say maybe 1/4 mile. But only 10 seconds or so had passed. You have to wonder what can travel that fast in the woods and swamp. <BR>     About another 10 seconds passed and it screamed again. This time it sounded like it was right near us. I really wanted to see what it was <BR>but then I thought could I protect my son.<BR> Whatever was coming was smashing everything. It sounded like it was knocking everything down that was in it''s way. As soon as I heard that I turned the moped around and was trying to go as fast as I could. Many times I would have to help push the bike with my feet to keep it going. I told my son if anything happened to run as fast as he could the direction we were going, and to not stop till he got back to the polebarn. We finally got out of the woods and into the field. I was hollering at the top of my voice to get someones attention. <BR>But everyone was in front of the polebarn so no body heard me. All I could think of then was here <BR>I''m about to die and nobody will see anything.<BR> We got to the front of the polebarn and the reason nobody heard me was cause they had the radio playing loud. I told everyone what happened, and everyone had a good laugh. But no one would go back to see if anything was still there. I really wanted to see what it was, but I was not willing to go back by myself.<BR>",

    " It was the spring of 1994 I believe, probably April.  I was 15 years old.  The incident happened at my friends house in Girard, PA.  There was me and four of my friends.  It was the weekend and we were ready to camp out about a half a mile away from my friends house.  He lived at the end of a dead end road that ran right by Interstate 90.  Girard is about 15 - 20 minutes from the Ohio Border. <BR> We got all of our stuff back to camp and set up around 5 or 6pm.  Our camp site was at the bottom of a ravine with a small creek running through the middle of it.  It was right next to the highway but down a little bit.  The area was dense forest of deciduous mixed with pine.<BR>  Around 12pm or so we split up into teams and started having a b-b gun war across the ravine from each other.  This was going on for probably about a half hour or so.  I was on the side of the ravine furthest from the highway with two of my friends, my other two friends were on the other side shooting at us.  Then I started to hear something moving through the woods behind us.  It was pretty loud movement with dead fallen branches snapping and twigs breaking.  I grew up out in the woods,and at the time was an avid hunter.  I have seen lots of deer and other native animals in the area and never heard such a ruckus.  Not even from humans before.  So the three of us sat there and listened for a while to this thing getting closer.  We were all a little nervous about what the hell this thing could be.  So when it continued we called a truce over to the other side and joined our other two friends on the bank next to the highway.  They said that they had been hearing the same noises and movement close to them.  <BR>So with the five of us all huddled together with b-b guns aimed we waited for a little bit.  The noises started up again really close this time so we decided to shine our lights in the same direction on the count of three.  As soon as we turned on the lights the only thing I really saw or paid attention to were these very large green glowing eyes.  They were much bigger than a humans or a bear for that matter.  I took a couple of shots at this thing in reaction( I don''t know what a b-b gun would have down but it was pure instinct).  When I got ahold of my self I realized that all of my friends were already over the fence and running down the middle of the highway.  I busted tail and caught up with them when we all stopped on the side of the higway in a ditch to rest for a second.  We were all questioning what each other saw and talking about what the hell this thing was when all of the sudden one of my friends looked up to the top of the hill that the highway fence was on and yelled wolf.  I looked up and saw this enormous outline of a body standing upright, and the biggest thing that stuck out in my mind was the size of the arms compared to the whole body.

    " My experience with Bigfoot occured when I was about ten years old during the fall of 1977.  I was always exploring the wooded area between route 5 and route 20 in northwestern PA, west of Crayton road.  One cool, wet evening just before dusk, I walked north into the woods via the main trail from our house.  At the fork in the trail, running north and east, was a small sand pit which I crouched into because I saw someone or something in the distance.  I peered over the rough, looking slightly northeastward. I watched this thing for nearly five minutes.  It was over 7 feet tall and weighted about 500 - 700 pounds from as far as I could tell.  It was black from head to toe.  Even its face was black.  It was tearing off tree limbs and pushing over rotted trees.   Playing as such as I had done several days earlier at the exact same spot. It must have been watching me.  It amazed me because there were really no rotted trees left to push over or rotted tree branches to break. It''s strength was incredible.  I could hear the sounds of trees crackling and smashing to the ground.  I grew extremely scared by bigfoots size and strength and what it might do to me if it saw me.  The hair on my body stood straight up and without looking back I turned and ran as fast as I could.  I ran approximately 50 yards back along the trail and another 100 yards through the field to my parents house.  I never returned to explore the woods for another six months.  ",

The other I didn''t see until I saw where the first one was moving away from me and headed for the tree line.   I was no more than 25 yards away.  The first one I saw very clearly.  It was approximately 8 feet tall and walking upright.  It had a sloping forehead.  The hands were at about the same level as its knees.  My best estimate would be 600 lbs.  The color was all black.  It had no hair on its face or hands.  The only sound it made was when it walked I could hear the grass being trampled.  It never looked my way or made any vocalization.  Its arms swung slightly while walking with the knuckles facing forward and not to the side like a human. My best estimate on the forearm length would be 16 inches.  When it turned left and into the tree line,  I could see its back clearly.  That''s when I saw the other one.  I saw its back only.  Shoulders on both were broad and straight.  Approximately 3 ft across.  I smelled or heard nothing, during, or after the sighting.  After they disappeared, I threw the salt block over the 12 feet embankment and left.  I have not been back since. The only thing I took away from this encounter is all they wanted to do was get away from me.",

There was absolutely no wind at all. To the right of this leaf was a very large black mass moving back and forth methodically.

    " My encounter happened at the end of summer in 1973, or 1974.  It was late August/early September, as it was the time the blackberries were ripening.<BR>I was 15 or 16 years old, and had a dirt bike that I rode on the many lease roads in the hills surrounding Bradford.  The bike had an expansion chamber, which is an extremely loud exhaust system.  I generally rode it every day on the hill behind our house in Bradford, so I knew all the roads and trails.  My grandfather had built a lot of the roads with a bulldozer, years back, working for the Kendall Oil Company.  We had also hiked this area extensively when my friends and I were kids, sometimes camping for the night.  On one occasion when we were about 9 or 10, we were chased home by a frightening screeching in the late morning from the top of this hill. (Just two of us)  We didnt know what the noise was, only that we had to run from it.  I only mention this as it was very close to the same area as where I had my encounter, and in my mind, the same animal.<BR>The day of the encounter, I had ridden up to the road at the ridgeline of the hill, and about a mile and a half towards the hospital area.  I didnt turn that way and instead went straight, towards the pipeline, which is a cleared area that runs straight up and down the mountain.  I stopped there for a second, and turned back around about 1/4 mile to a group of blackberry bushes.  I shut off the bike and started picking the berries, until the bees got to me, and I took my handful of berries and walked away.<BR>I walked back to the pipeline, stopping right before the clearing, hoping to catch some sort of animal crossing the clearing.  I had been a hunter since I was very young, which is the custom in the area, and was very good at walking quietly in the woods.  As I looked down the hill from the top of the clearing, I could see what looked like a bear, digging into the log that had been placed across the pipeline to keep people from using the cleared area as a road.  I reasoned that he heard the noise of my bike going away, so he figured I was out of the area.  The stink of the 2-cycle engine also probably masked the smell of me, as well.<BR>I was young enough to think I should get a closer look, so I got myself to a point about 50 yards away and uphill from the animal, and about 25 yards from the ridgeline road.  I stood there and ate the berries and watched what I thought was the butt of the bear visible above the log.  Remember; the log was about 50 yards down a steep hill, and the log was about 3 feet tall, and crossing the pipeline.  The bear would have to be very large for me to see as much as I did, which was a good foot or more above the log, and he was on the other side of it.<BR>He seemed to be digging for bugs or something in the log.  After a few minutes of me standing still watching him, he suddenly realized I was there.  He stopped, tried to remain still for a minute, and all the time I still thought I was watching a bear.<BR>Then he stood up.  This was no bear.  It was the most surreal moment in my life, either then or now, and Im 52 years old.  He was tall, at least 7 feet, as his knees were just barely covered by the log.  He had hair like that of a black bears fur that time of year, basically the same color and length, which obscured a lot of the features of his face.<BR>We both stood there frozen for a minute, staring at each other.  My thought was to get out of there, but the only movement I could muster was to drop the few berries I had left.  I started dropping berries, and he just turned and walked to the far side of the pipeline and into the woods, down a trail just to his side of the log.<BR>I say walked, because it was so smooth and graceful across that terrain, that I was completely overwhelmed.  As I said, I thought I was pretty good at getting around in this terrain, and I am.  The movement he used was so economical and efficient that I still see it in my mind and marvel.  There was very little or no bobbing up and down; his arms swung, but not wildly, like you would expect with an ape. The arm swing wasnt like a tight-rope walker either, as I may have needed to do, to walk across the area he walked.  It was just smooth, amazing.<BR>I stood for a few seconds after he disappeared, then decided to get myself out of there.  I ran back to my bike and headed the other way as fast as I could.  Then I started thinking I should go see where he went.  I turned around and headed back and down that pipeline to the tree.  I got the bike to the trail he used, which is a trail that immediately takes you from light to deep shade, and stays perpetually muddy.  I have tried that trail a few other times (with the same friend who was chased with me, years earlier) and have only been able to go a few yards before I had to get off the bike and push.  I started to get bogged down, so I got back out as quick as I could.<BR>I dont know what I was thinking, I guess I thought the noise would keep him away, but when I hit the mud I remembered that I couldnt take that trail.  It was always creepy dark back there, too.  I wouldnt have gone back there if it werent to prove to myself that I didnt have to run away.<BR>I never looked for tracks.  This is something else thats very strange.  I was a hunter, I looked for tracks everywhere.  The muddy trail was probably covered with them.  This has always bothered me.  I can only think that my mind was so sure that no one would ever believe me, that proof was the farthest thing from my mind.  The whole experience was so alien that I never told anyone for about 25 years.  Back then, all the Bigfoot sightings were in Washington/Oregon/California.  No one would have believed me.<BR>Maybe I also didnt want anyone to find him.  I felt extremely special to have had this experience, and I didnt want to betray that or the Bigfoot.  Anyone from Bradford will now be able to figure out where this happened from my story, and that bothers me.  I dont think they should be chased.  They seem to be a very human animal, and maybe too vulnerable to our world and weapons.<BR>Im posting this after having read the other Bradford sighting, and seeing the Elk County photos.  I did quite a bit of hunting in Elk County, and its very easy for me to believe that those photos show a real, Bigfoot animal.  As to the 1963 Bradford sighting, the Barbour Street location is very close to my sighting, and I will leave it at that.<BR>",

    " These incidents have occurred over a period of approximately 7 years. The occurrences have not been limited to a particular time of year.  <BR>I have never, nor has any in our group, sighted a creature. Most have experienced hearing knocks, LOUD branch breaks, hearing bi-pedal footsteps emanating from a creature much larger than a human would make, smelled noxious odors, and had that inexplicable feeling of being watched.<BR>The place is a cabin which has been in my son-in-laws family for 4 generations. It is located on the edge of the Allegheny National Forest, off the summit of a mountain. Across the lane from the cabin is a large meadow, belonging to a local doctor. This is sometimes planted in grain crops, other times allowed to remain fallow. There are other cabins scattered along the lane; none within eye-sight of the other. <BR>My first trip was in October of 2006. There was no other activity at the other camps. My son-in-law (Eric) and I arrived about 8-8:30 at night in the darkness. Upon exiting the Jeep, I had an immediate feeling of being watched. I have spent a good deal of time in the woods, hunting, fishing, and hiking. I am not easily spooked.  After dinner, cleaning up, and sitting up a bit talking we turned in about midnight. <BR>Around 2 A.M. I was awakened by the sound of the old wooden table and chairs being pushed about on the deck. We determined it must be a bear, and went back to sleep. Approximately 2 hours later we heard something rustling about the fire pit. We did NOT cook any food outdoors, we brought in all our empty bottles and such when we came in to discourage bears and other critters. <BR>In the morning, we found the table and chairs had been moved about, which a bear or even a large raccoon could have done. However, the fire pit had been scattered about, some of the smoldering logs rolled aside.  <BR>Another time, we were hunting in the forest behind the cabin. The topography is typical Appalachian mountain; rugged, steep slopes, ravines, small streams and bogs. Here and there are small oil seeps as well. We had just descended into a fairly open area which promised grouse. This was early November, crisp but not cold. We were each carrying shotguns loaded with upland game shells. We were walking approximately 50 yards apart when we stopped, looked at one another and asked What is that smell?<BR>From out of no-where came the most putrid, overpowering smell. It was not the oil-seeps, which have their own sulfur like smell. This was horrid! It was like a skunk on steroids, with a good measure of open septic tank, and some rotten garbage added for good measure.  We continued on our way, the smell dissipated after about 100 feet.  We tried to tell one another it was a dead deer or something; but we both knew better. I worked in a funeral home while in college; and have never experienced anything that nauseating.   We also had an unnerving feeling of being watched the entire time we were there.<BR>Upon relating the above to my daughter, Erics wife, she stated she has smelled awful odors for no apparent reason as well and felt like she was being watched several times.<BR>We have heard howls, far in the distance, and others within a quarter mile  or so of the cabin. There are coyotes in the area, yet these are much longer in duration, and have more range. Some start low, and rise toward nearly a falsetto pitch. Others have been more monotone yet will waver somewhat. Others will start low, and culminate in a scream. This is not a bob-cat, not a coyote, and all members of our party are accounted for.<BR>In March of 2014, a group of us went for Spring Opening. There were 5 of us there. As darkness set in, I decided to venture out to the open meadow to observe the Winter constellations. This is about 100 yards from the cabin. <BR>The cabin is situated on the downward slope from the summit, which is the meadow. The area behind and on both sides of the cabin is a fairly steep slope. It is heavily grown with second growth trees, brush, and scrub. There are also a lot of blow-down branches which makes walking even in daylight difficult. At night, it is an invitation for a sprained ankle at best.<BR>As I was observing the stars and enjoying the silence, I heard footsteps. Not in the trail, not in the meadow, but coming UP the slope to the south of the cabin. My initial thought was a bear. As I listened, it was apparent the foot falls were from a biped. I called out if it was any of our group and received no reply. Then the steps would start again. I called again, louder, and the steps stopped for a moment.  Then, they began again, finally stopping by the edge of the lane.<BR>There were no lights showing, the moon was in the final phase of its final quarter, and just a sliver.<BR>I started to return to the cabin. I was about 20 yards from where I heard the steps stop along the edge of the lane. As I drew parallel to that area, I heard shuffling of the underbrush, as if whatever it was had turned its entire body sideways to watch me pass.<BR>When I entered the cabin, everyone was where I had left them. There were no new leafs, mud or debris in the doorway. <BR>When I asked if they heard anything, they all said no, as they were watching Planes, Trains and Automobiles on VHS. <BR>Finally, this past Spring, a group of us went up for a weekend. While sitting about the rear deck, enjoying a fire and talking, a member of our party was encouraged to do their howl. They did. Then about 30 seconds later, the sound of a very large tree limb snapping came from down the slope behind the cabin.<BR>Could it have been a bear stepping on a branch? Perhaps, but that would be very coincidental to step on a limb just after a howl.<BR>I KNOW there is something in those mountains. I cant prove it physically; it one of those things that you know that you know.<BR>Please keep this location undisclosed. We would hate to see a bunch of people go hunting for these creatures. They dont deserve to be pursued and bothered. <BR><BR>I have been needing to share this with someone who won''t think I am off my rocker. Thank you.<BR>",

    " I was driving west on I-80 at 65 MPH, in the right lane with cruise control set at 65. We were returning from a wedding in NY. We had been in a an area of mountainous/hilly forest close to road. The country started to open up with some farmland. My wife dozed and I was rather lost in thought. I diverted my sight to about 30 degrees to the right and was startled to see something that got my attention and kept my attention until about 60 degrees to the right. It passed quickly out of view because of the speed of the vehicle and a bank and some foliage obscuring the view. <BR><BR>The road is two lane, one way and I could not return to the area without backing a long distance. There was no other traffic in sight at the time.<BR><BR>What I saw was a figure, only from about what I would assume was midway from between the elbows and wrist upward. The figure was what I think of as being the wrong color, it was the color of a kraft paper bag except slightly more reddish. ( seemed the wrong color from reports I have read). It was long hair covered and I could not see a face. It was not moving during the approx. 3 seconds that I was able to view it. It was in front of some woods, not dense, standing about 150 feet away on the other side of a strip of narrow, fallow, farm field. It seemed to be facing the highway although I could not see a face. I assumed the field had high growth in it as I only saw the upper portion.It was only the upper body and head with the hair obscuring any sign of a neck.I could not estimate size but it was stocky.<BR><BR>Among my reactions, I was imaging something or someone had put up a mannikin. I rethought that, as there did not seem to be habitation nearby and a mannikin would likely have been a full figure to get maximum startle value.<BR><BR>I know I saw something that I can accurately describe and draw a rather accurate picture. ( I am a retired industrial designer ) From the briefness of the sighting I can only say what I saw  and think that this sighting would only be of value if there were other sightings in the area. <BR><BR>When I saw the figure a strong chill went down my spine that lasted several moments. This sort of thing is not in my normal experience. I have been an instrument and glider pilot for 48 years and am rather used to making quick, fairly accurate observations in relation to that. I also have been trying to convince myself that I did not see anything. It was unsettling.<BR><BR>",

    "My son and I were prospecting on the top of a ridge on the south side of Lake Kachess three years ago when we came across Big Foot tracks in the snow.We had driven to the end of the Box canyon rd. Which is off the Lake Kachess rd.(gated now). I wanted to explore the big slide area along an earthquake fault along that same ridge. The old road in that area is closed because of the slide so we walked across the slide area and beyond.I had heard from a local resident that some bluish agates could be found just beyond the slide. We found them in some darkish colored rock then walked beyond to an old clear cut. There was still snow drifts in the timber at that time and we walked up along the timber. It was this area that I got spooked. I got a feeling something was watching us and looked around for tracks. Sure enough, about 50 ft. into the timber their were these big tracks. It spooked my son and he said what are those? I said, well it looks like you are seeing your first big Foot tracks.I could tell that they were four to five days old because the snow was melting and the tracks didn''t have sharp edges on them.You could see the toe marks though. I had a hard time believing this my self. So we followed them from the timber, across the old clearcut and into the timber on the other side. At first I thought it was some clown with snow shoes in the shape of feet but after following that far I could tell from the depth of the tracks that this thing was heavy. I weigh almost 300 lbs. and i could not imprint the snow that far. The snow was pretty hard packed.My son was getting real uneasy so we turned around and went home. I''ve been a hunter most of my life and this is the first time I''ve ever run onto tracks like these. They were at least 18 inches long. If you send me maps of the areas, I can mark the locations and send them back.",

    "It made no noise except a grunt like a big ape and a kinda squeel when it took off. The animal, and I am sure these things are animal and not human, was about eight feet tall or a little more. It probably weighed around 400 pounds. It had a grayish colored hair that was probably 12 inches in length all over its body. It had a blackish colored face with lots of hair and almost no neck at all. Its arms extended below it''s knees and were very muscular.When it took off, it used it''s arms to propell it to speed and grabbed at the vine maples in front of it then swung them behind it as it took off. I think this was as a protective manuever to cover its back as it left. It had a small butt and ran like an ape. As for sex/ I would guess male. I didn''t see any breasts. It had so much hair between its legs that I couldn''t make out any sex organs.In closing, I can honestly say that they scare me. The thing is as powerful as a big bull elk and could rip your arms off easily. And their color could hide them in any woods in the northwest easily. This is a very intellegent animal by its movements, its no wonder they can hide from man so easily. Their hearing is as good as a deer''s. I don''t know about their sense of smell.

    " We were walking (my hunting partner and I) down the road trying to spot a grouse that we had just seen fly from the area of the swamp to the timber across the road from it. We were standing on the north side of the road looking up in the trees and trying to figure how to get off the road in the dense underbrush to get a shot at the grouse. I got a funny fealing that something was watching us and could smell a strong smell kinda like a wet elk. (That season was open too and that was basically why we were hunting). I turned around and walked to the other side of the road away from Joe and looked in at the swamp.<BR><BR>I didn''t see anything at first, then I saw something very big move. It looked like the back of a bull elk so I spun around and gave a loud whisper to my partner (ELK)! By the time he walked the half dozen steps or so from where he was, to me the thing had stood up. I know it heard me even though I know I was pretty quiet. It scared the heel out of me when it did this. I knew right there and then it wasn''t an elk.<BR><BR>As it stood up, it came from a position from squating between it''s legs to a full stance. Just then he saw it and remarked to me, \"what the hell is that thing\"? I said you ain''t gonna believe this but that is a Bigfoot. He was worried about our safety and said, should we shoot it? Can we kill it? I said I don''t think we should, we might get in big trouble with the law and he had been there before.<BR><BR>So we watched it for a few minutes. It was very warry of us and kept rocking back and forth nervously. If we made any movements it would duck it''s head a few inches and stare at us. He was worried about it attacking us. It made a posturing movement like it meant business so I said let''s shoot into the road and see if we can scare it off, so we did and it did. It took off like a bat outta hell in the direction away fro us. He said, ain''t nobody in hell gonna believe us, they''ll lock us up in the nutt house if we do. We agreed right there and then to stay silent. This happened in the mid 1980''s and I haven''t said anything about it to anyone but the wife and kids and a few people I trust. ",

    " I was out in the spring of the year scouting around for turkeys on the southern side of Jacks Mountain near the small village of Ellen Chapel (close to Lewistown).  I heard a type of clucking sound in a thick, brushy area and walked closer to investigate.  The clucking sound caught my attention because it sounded kind of like a turkey.  What was odd, however, was that a turkey would let me approach that closely.  As I got closer to the clucking sound, I heard a very low, gutteral growl coming from the brush.  I couldn''t see anything.  This growl really surprised and scared me.  I began walking away, but then curiosity got the better of me and I approached the area slowly again.  Once again, as I got closer, the low growl occurred.  Black bears are commonly seen around this area, but I can''t imagine that a black bear would simply hold still that close to a human and growl.  Whatever was growling at me was very well concealed because I couldn''t see a thing.  So after hearing this growl two or three times, I got freaked out and left.  The only other explanation I can think of--and the one I''ve held to for the last 25 years--is that there was another turkey hunter out in the woods, well camoflauged, who was messing with me.  I''ve never told anyone about this incident.  I started reading accounts here of people being growled at from thick brush and thought my experience might be of the same nature.  ",

My friend and I looked at each other and said what was that. <BR><BR>We both are very familiar with the animals of Pa. I have had bobcats circle me at night and often heard thier cry while camping. <BR><BR>Niether of us have ever heard a noise like that. Except for us there was complete quiet after the roar. <BR><BR>94. One of my hobbies is rock climbing. I like to scout for unclimbed rock . I was told by a friend that there was some large cliffs behind his house on 655 which borders the Game Land. <BR><BR>I hiked up what passed for a trail through steep dense cover. The rocks are visible from the road and looked promising.<BR><BR>I was dissapointed to find the rock to be loose and steppy. Not what rock jock wants after a very tough bushwack.<BR><BR>Being a hunter I was also checking game sighns. <BR><BR>I found 4 or 5 deer within 100 yards or so of each other did not appear to be shot or attacked by dogs but abdominal cavities were open. <BR>",

At about 9:00 p.m. we had our first bite and ended up being a 15 minute fight to end up being a turtle.  Shortly after at approximately 9:30 p.m. we heard what sounded like our first wood knock.  Personally I didn''t believe or didn''t want to believe what I had just heard. But within minutes we all heard the 2nd knock and were all speechless in what we had just heard. After talking about it for a couple minutes we heard another but this time it came from the other side of the river, speechless yet again we all just looked at each other and within seconds we heard another but this time it was right being us and close. That''s when we knew we had to leave.  As we were packing our fishing poles in the car we heard 4 loud aggressive knocks within 30 yards of were we parked. We immediately showed the poles in the car and left.  After getting several miles down the road we stopped and said let''s go back and try and get it on video because know one would believe us. So that''s what we did and we got 3 knocks on video.",

    " <BR>I have lived in Adams County, PA all of my life except for four years in the U S Navy and four years in college. I read in the Gettysburg Times tonight about your search team that is coming to Adams County. Take my story for what it is worth. <BR><BR>On Thursday nights I would go with my mother to play bingo at the Greenmount Fife Hall on Rt 15 south of Gettysburg. I was about thirteen years old, which would have been the summer of 1961. There were other kids there and we would play hide and go seek and do all the fun stuff kids did back then. Playing bingo wasn''t one of them.The firehall held shooting matches and constructed a target box in the lot behind the fire hall. I hid behind this target box during a hide and go seek game. I remember that it was dark perhaps 10PM and the area was dimly lit by the outsise lights at the firehall. I was backing around the corner of the target box and backed into a big animal. I turned to see what it was and saw this human like figure, a little over five feet tall, not really heavy, covered with hair not like a bear but long like hair on the hooves of Clydesdale horses. I remember the odor as being a musk scent like that of sweat or a deer like musk, very strong. I took off running as fast as I could go to tell the others. They or nobody else believed me and when we went back to see if anything was really there we found nothing. <BR><BR>I often thought of that event but convinced myself that a sasquatch would not be found in a populated area such as this.

    " The sighting occurred awhile ago.  So long that I am not sure of the year, but I would guess Jan or Feb of 1998.  The reason I am reporting it now is because I was watching the History Channel, and the animal they displayed was very similar, with a few exceptions.  The hair was even over the body, the History Channel display was baggy at the ankles and narrow at the knees.  The eyes were definitely very red.  The time of the incident was approximately 1AM in the morning.  The importance is the animal was no more than 150 feet from me, and I stopped the car and the animal and I stared at each other for quite a long time, until I got tired and left the scene.<BR><BR>\tDetails:  My wife and I were returning home from a friends home in Gettysburg PA along Route 116 between Gettysburg and Fairfield.  In front in my headlights, I saw this animal step over a fence and walk across the road, West to East.  The animal stopped in the middle of the field and looked back at the car, and I stopped the car to observe.<BR><BR>\tThe reason this was not reported sooner is because we did not know how to report the event, and until reading your Web Page, I did not realize how prevalent the sightings are.<BR><BR> ",

    " Hello,<BR><BR>My name is Doug and though I am very reluctant to post this story; I am going to do so anyways. The area that this happened  could not be a more unlikely area for a bigfoot occurance then or  especially now with all the development of the farmland in the last 25 years which has been extensive and at a phenominal rate. After reading many (if not every last report on this website) and coming across more that a few that have happened in improbable areas (bigfoot running down neighborhood streets and sightings/ vocalizations near condo areas), I decided there just might be some merit in submitting this for review. A skilled researcher might be able to shed some more light maybe.<BR><BR>My friends parents owned a small somewhat defunct farm with (I''m guessing maybe 15-20 acres of land -not the best judge on that) They had 3 horses; 2 mares that were allowed out in the field areas; a stabled stallion, and a pony I believe. The barn was in dis-repair and part of the roof had collapsed years earlier. There was a large pond that was almost completely enclosed with an impenatrable thicket of briars ringing almost the whole cirmcuference of the pond, except for a small area that was kept open for access for the horses to water. Much of the property was overgrown with these same briars that tended to make big circular mounds here and there in the field. The house sat close to the road; the barn to the left and further behind. The extreme left side of their property was bordered by a small stream that edged along a small (100 ft x 30 ft) stand of very dense pine trees. These pines (species unknown) tend to have a very dense understory of almost horizontal dead, dry, branches due to years of growth an minimal sunlight. The lower end of this pine grove had a mowed lawn area (next door neighbors property who were also related to my friend family) You had to access the camping area through the neighbors propery as the overgrowth of briars and other weeds, brambles, trees made it impossible to get there directly for the E------- property. The pond in relation to the campsite was to the left if you were looking back up towards the road; with the stream running between. The dense pine grove then lay between you and the road; unless you skirted around it through the neigbors backyard.<BR><BR>This is what happened. No sighting but a vocalization.<BR><BR>We had gone down to the campsite had built a fire and been down there for about an hour. During this time we all felt uneasy even though we had been there before many times. This is a long time ago but to the best of my memory we had been joking; probably made something to eat over the fire but something felt really wrong this time. \"Wrong\" is the best word I can use to describe. I remember I felt like I couldn''t just sit down by the fire and stay with the conversation though. From back in the pine grove was the occasional, deliberate braking of branches that were just a little too large (to the sophisticated human ear) and just had the sound of being \"up off the ground some ways\" This would start and stop. We would listen and comment on it. First we thought maybe the mares had gotten back into the woods, unusual but this later was confirmed not to be so because we found out the next day that they were stabled for the night. We then thought it might be some older boys who were trying to scare us into running. It would be quiet for awhile then there would be a sense of movement closer to where we were and then receeding. We shined a flashlight and ventured back alittle ways but saw or smelled nothing. The sounds began again this time definately agitated, insistent with a very permiable feeling. We started to get un-nerved  moved out into the neighbors backyard. The sound grew louder, with traceable movement and then this ear splitting scream cut right out into the night. One loud shriek louder than anything should have to be. It just cut right to the core of your soul. Like so many reports I''ve read on this website, it''s virtually impossible to do it justice with a human description precisly because it sounded so inhuman. We just ran like hell back to the house, left everything behind. No sense of being followed at all. No visual sighting (I almost wish). No bad smells or odors. In terms of other reports this pales, I know. But this is what happened and I never forgot it. We knew what Sasquatch were at the time, but no one ever heard of sightings east of the Mississippi to the best of my memory then. We kind of joked that maybe that''s what our unseen friend was. Years later when I read and saw the reports from the southern part of York County (report on file with your website.) did I ever give any serious thought.",

    " I was very young, about 6 or 7 years old I guess. My cousin and I were out and about 1/2 mile from my parents'' house in Coganhouse Township. The nearest landmark I can think of is Fry''s Turkey Ranch restaurant at the top of Steam Valley Mountain. <BR><BR>The area we were in was a grassy one, with forest on three sides, and a small stream which ''y'' ed into a larger one some 100 yds or so from the site, and to the south. This small stream, so we though, would be a perfect place to make a holding pool for trout, so we decided to build one about halfway from the woods to the north, and the larger stream it fed into. <BR><BR>There is a swampy area just to the northeast of the site, with a few trees surrounding it, and a couple of large rocks. The forest to the east is comprised of thick trees somewhat, with the area around the swamp slightly less dense. There are small bushy type trees dotted along the small stream, with another grassy area just behind, and before the thick forest to the east. <BR><BR>There is a built watershed to the northwest, about 30 yds from the site, which hasn''t been of any real use for quite some time. I suppose it is pretty much in ruin by now. <BR><BR>There are traces of what once used to be a dirt road running over the hill to the west, and down into the site area, then curving back up and to the northwest beside the watershed, as well as to the south toward the larger stream. <BR><BR>We had begun by digging out the area we intended to use, and had placed some rocks to form a dam. My cousin decided that the rocks we were using were too small, and that there were probably bigger ones downstream around the larger of the two streams. He informed me that he was going to look for them, and left me there to continue on with the building of the dam with the rocks we had. <BR><BR>He was gone about fifteen minutes or so, when I noticed that the water running into the dammed part I was working on, was as muddy as the water running out and on downstream. The current wasn''t really swift, as this stream was fed by a spring, and coming from the forest to the north. I looked to see what was causing the water to be so dirty, and when I turned my head back to the east, I saw this large hairy creature standing just across the stream from me, about 6 or 7 feet away I guess. It was massive. Hair covered it from head to toe, with a bald-like face. It''s eyes were dark, and It made no movements toward me or away. This creature was pretty quiet for being so big. I was terrified, and sat frozen, only able to stare into \"it''s\" eyes. I couldn''t move, and could barely breathe, so yelling for help was out of the question. I am older now, but I still sometimes get frightened whenever I tell> someone about that day. It stood there for what seemed like minutes, and when I looked away finally to scream for my cousin, I guess it left. When I looked back after a second or two of yelling, \"it\" was gone.<BR> <BR>We didn''t stick around to check for prints, as after I told my cousin what had occurred, we got out of there as fast as we could. My mother didn''t believe me when I begged her to get the gun and go out there with me after it. Since then though, I have changed my mind about the method of finding the creature. I believe that the only way this being should be trophied is by camera or just by plain sight.<BR> <BR>We didn''t go back to that area for about a week, and the summer ended. My cousin would come to my house for a week at a time, and we would go out and do all sorts of things in the woods. We are both educated on the woods, and we know a bear when we see one. We have trapped together, fished, hunted, and ridden motorcycles in that area during our childhood. I know this creature wasn''t a bear, or anything else I had ever seen before. Since then I have never gone into the woods without some sort of defense, whether it be a rifle, axe, bow or sword, I never have been out there without something since. I was just that scared. <BR><BR>Daniel Burkhart <BR> <BR>> <BR>> <BR>",

    " Was out late one night walking my Beagle before retiring for the night.  We live in a somewhat rual area, the village of Orangeville has a population of about 600 or so.<BR><BR>Because of the town make up at that time, very few people were up at that hour.  so, in walking west up the road with the mountain to the north of us, all the hoses on the hill were dark and quiet with ony a dog or two barking.<BR><BR>I had walked my dog about 300 yards up the road, about 200 yards away from the closest house.  At this point the woods coming down from the mountain are right next to the road.<BR><BR>We had just stoped and were beginning our walk back to the house when my dog stoped and looked up  at the mountain.  His hair on his back stood up and he started growling.  I looked up to where he was staring and didn''t see any kind of movement or hear or smell anything different.<BR><BR>After about 10 seconds I tried to coax the dog into heading back to the house, but he did not move. About 30 seconds after the dog first stoped I heard a howel / scream of something that I have never heard before.  It seemed to come down off the mountain, it didn''t sound close by, so I figured the sound to come somewhere in front of us about 1/2 or near the top of the mountain.<BR><BR>The sound, similar sounding to the one at http://www.bluenorth.com/klamath_recording.htm made all my hairs stand on end, and my dog made a protective stance between me and the sound.  The sound lasted for about 20 seconds or less with the echo through the woods.  Several of the dogs on the hill also began barking when the sound came down off the moountain.<BR><BR>At the time I had no idea what I had heard, I coaxed my dog to move and we went back down to the house and turned in for the night.  Since that night I havn''t heard any other sounds like that.<BR><BR>The next morning when I took the dog up for his morning walk, I stoped in the area where we had heard the sound.  the dog acted normally and I looked for any kind of animal tracks but didn''t notice anything along the road edge or just inside the woods.<BR><BR>It wasn''t untill a few months later that when I was watching Sightnings and they played the recording of a possible Big Foot scream from Washington state that I realized I had heard the same sound in Pennsylvania just a few months previous.<BR><BR>At that time I really didn''t know of anyone to report it too, and also figured no one would beleive that I had heard such a sound.<BR><BR>It wasn''t untill a recient TV show on TLC about bigfoot that I dediced to do some more research and find a location to log my sighting.",

    " Sighting was seen in 1991 in Blue Mountain Berks County PA.  State Game Land 110 I believe in early February.  I was grouse hunting on the top of the mountain, there was ten to twelve inches of snow with a half to one inch of ice on top of the snow.  It was very difficult to puncture your feet to walk through the snow and ice.  I shot my grouse, on top of the mountain about a half to 3/4 of a mile from where we came up to the top of the mountain.  I shot twice after my friend with me yelled grouse, I yelled I got it to my friend who then proceeded to walk up to me.  He was 75yds away and it took him about 15-20min to get up to me.  Then he walked a trail that went back to where the road starts at the top of the mountain.  I stood there for 15 min. as I heard my friend walking away from me,afer I could hear his footsteps no more, I turned the other direction and was looking at the side of the mountain that we came up.  I noticed a dark figure running along the ridge of the top of the mountain, for 50 to 100yds. it ran, there was an opening and it stoped.  Then it proceeded to run straight for me uphill and did not stop until it was about 40 to 50ft away from me.  It was not out of breath and did not make a sound and just stood there and looked at me for about 1-2min. and then walked away in the direction that it came from.  First of all in those conditions you could not run or barely walk in it.  It was hard to puncture the ice on top of the snow to walk let alone run.  It went through it like it wasn''t even there for 200yds and when it stopped 50ft away, you couldn''t even see it breath or hear it breathe.  He ran that distance, in about 1-3min maybe.  It scared the hell out of me i wasn''t sure what it was, until it stopped right in front of me.  It found me I wasn''t looking for it.  And I can tell that when he stopped in the opening on the ridge that he can see blaze orange because he ran faster then straight for me after he seen me in my blaze orange one piece outfit.  He was there in no time at all, running uphill a 100 to 150yds.  He walked away and looked back at me once and then kept going.  He was all black, very long hair, it was hard to see his face through the hair.  Tall around 7-7 1/2ft 400-500lbs I thought. Very powerful animal seemed very intelligent because I think he heard the gunshots or the yelling and wanted to find who was making the noise on the mountain and came right to me.  I was scared at first and when it stopped, I put my shotgun right on it at 45-50ft and it didn''t even flinch it wasn''t scared and it just walked away.  My friend with me is 6''1 200lbs and when I told him what happened, he didn''t believe me but he tried to run on the road at the top of the mountain on level ground, flat, he took 3 steps and fell on his face.",

I glanced away from the beams and when I looked back at the road I was coming to the bottom of a dip in the road and as I looked back at the road I saw TWO VERY LARGE LEGS WITH EXTREMELY LARGE FEET ATTACHED ! I saw three strides and it was across the road and the fourth step took it up a 7 foot bank. The fur appeared to be long and very dark, almost black but with a bit of a sheen to it. The fur appeared to go all the way to the ground around the feet. Because I was approaching the bottom of the dip, my headlights were only catching the very bottom of where the road came back up and he was at the very top of my headlight beams. I backed up and pulled out a light, looked for tracks through my car window. even though I am an experienced hunter and tracker, I felt goose bumps and the hair on the back of my neck was standing up and I left after I locked the doors. I''ve seen many bears, three mountain lions, a fisher and many other wild animals in many areas. This was not a four legged creature. ",

Just to state a fact of point,my mini-blinds were white, down all the way and the blinds themselves were folding downward,so,anyone outside can see in,but,if they are up you can''t see in. Mind you,Our moble home is 14'' high and 70''long on two acres of land in a rual area.outside of Montrose,PA. We sold our property in Feb.2008.<BR>I never went outside to investigate what I saw, I figured that I would leave well enough alone,just let whatever it was be on it''s intended journey.

    "  Here goes, I guess depending upon how you look at it I am either the luckiest person where Bigfoot is concerned or unfortunate in that coming forward in some people''s eyes makes me either a story teller or a nut.  My sighting occured on a 1968 family camping trip near the Delaware River in Tohickon Valley Camp Grounds in Bucks County, PA.  I was 16 yrs old. I rode by bike over to explore the newest camping area that was as yet unfinished. As I rode through a clearing down a dirt road I had the unnerving feeling I was being watched from the bushes.  I told myself that I was being silly and proceeded to ride into the entrance tree covered area. I noticed the new bathhouse, wanted to check it out and parked my bike along side a split rail fence.  After finding the door locked I turned around to go back to my bike and that is when I saw not 8 ft away the most frightening and butt ugly creature I have ever seen.  It was standing upright on the other side of the split rail fence.  It had both hands on the top railing all the while shifting its weight back and forth rocking from side to side. I could clearly see the face in the sunlight but details of the body were lost in the shadow of the shade of the trees. It had a wild eyed look upon its face with the body language being restless. I must have been in shock as I calmly decided to get the heck out of there and back on my bike. When I got back to the our camp site I wanted to tell someone but I didn''t even believe what I had just saw. I had no point of reference except that it was about 5''5 and monkeyish looking but not human. After I got home I wanted to tell my Mom or Dad or neighbor but was afraid they would make fun of me or think I was crazy. I kept asking myself how I was going to sleep that it would cause me nightmares. So I decided then and there to put it out of my consciousness. Everytime I thought how frightened I was, I pushed it out of my mind. Eventually I succeeded. Fast forward to 2002 and I find your BFRO website. (It has taken me another 5 years to get up the courage to write this report). I never gave it much thought about Bigfoot and Washington/Oregon state but it was interesting to see that this research was genuine and scientifically based.  I was surprised to see so many reports here in PA. As I was reading about other sightings one night, the memory of that camping experience came flooding back with the realization that I had come face to face with a Bigfoot. Upon reflection, I now realize that I have had three more encounters (1978-Bucks,1997 and 2005-Berks County).         ",

    " I was driving back from work late on Tuesday the 25th of February and I''ll never forget what I saw. As I was driving down Green Lane towards Levitown a giant creature that I can only describe as a Sasquatch. The creature was standing on two feet and had almost a human like form except for its nearly 9 foot stature. As it crossed in front of my car I could see it more clearly in my headlights, it was a very dark brown, but it was more like hair than fur which I found to be even stranger. It couldn''t have taken more than three steps to completely cross the road. As I swerved it was already nearly off the road all I could see though my drivers window were what seemed to be piercing blue eyes that seemed to glow. Though I could not differentiate if they were glowing or if it was a reflection of the moon. I haven''t been able to sleep much since, all I can think about is those piercing eyes. Once I found this website and read of the sightings, I knew I had to share what I saw. I''ve been looking online for another explanation, but I can''t find anything. ",

    " WELL I CANT BELIEVE AFTER ALL THESE YEARS IM DOING THIS BUT DUE TO THE RECENT TRAGEDY I HAVE A NEW RESPECT FOR HOW SHORT LIFE CAN BE,AND I THINK LEGITIMATE RESEARCHERS NEED TO HEAR ABOUT AN EXTRAORDINARY OCCURANCE THAT HAPPENED IN MY LIFE.  I KNOW EVEN THE MOST BELIEVING OF YOU ARE GOING TO THINK THIS IS BULLSHIT, BUT AS THE SAYING GOES TRUTH IS STRANGER THEN FICTION:<BR><BR>   IT WAS IN 1976 IN LEVITTOWN PA.  MY FRIEND  AND I SKIPPED SCHOOL (I WAS 16).  WE WERE GOING TO HUNT THE THIOKAL PROPERTY WITH BOWS.  THIS ACTUALLY IS THE MOST INCREDIBLE PART OF THIS, THE THIOKAL PROPERTY IS LOCATED IN THE MIDDLE OF LEVITTOWN THE MODEL FOR SUBURBIA.  THE<BR>PROPERTY WAS A FENCED WITH BARBED WIRE ENCLOSURE ABOUT A MILE SQUARE EACH WAY WITH A ROAD ON THE PERIMETER THAT ARMED GUARDS WOULD PATROL.  SO MY FRIEND AND I PLAYED COMMANDO ,SNEEKING UNDER THE FENCE WITH DIRT ON OUR FACES WEARING CAMO SHIRTS.  WE DID THIS BECAUSE IT WAS THE ONLY PLACE TO HUNT OR TRAP AND THE PROPERTY WAS EXCELLENT, SWAMPS, RAVINES, FLAT FIELDS AT THE TOP,HEAVY OLD WOODS,  GREAT DIVERISITY(BY THE WAY I DONT KNOW IF THIS IS THE INFO YOU WANT BUT I THINK YOU NEED TO KNOW THIS BUT BECAUSE I THINK ITS PERTINANT).  ANYWAY WE SNUCK IN AND WERE HUNTING SQUIRRELS WITH BOWS.  MY FRIEND JUST SHOT ONE OUT OF A TREE AND WAS BENDING DOWN TO CUT OFF ITS TAIL WHEN I SAW (I WAS LOOKING OUT FOR THE GUYS IN THE JEEPS) A BIGFOOT.   IT WAS REALLY CLOSE ABOUT 100-120 FEET AWAY.  IT WAS JUST STANDING THERE WITH ONE ARM HOLDING ONTO A PIECE OF TREE CHEWING IT (IVE SINCE COME TO REALIZE (AFTER SEEING A COW) IT WAS CHEWING IT LIKE AN UNGULATE SIDE TO SIDE I MEAN IT WAS EATING IT, CHEWING AND BITING OFF NEW PIECES .I WAS FROZEN WITH FEAR.   MY FRIEND WAS BUSY WITH THE SQUIRREL SO I WATCHED IT FOR 20 SECONDS?  IT DOESNT SOUND LONG BUT IT SEEMED LIKE FOREVER.  I GOT AN EXCELLENT LOOK  AT IT - 7 FOOT TALL MAYBE JUST A LITTLE MORE-REDDISH/BROWN HAIR 3-4 INCHES LONG.  THE THING I REMEMBER MOST WAS THE FACE BECAUSE IT WAS EATING.   I GUESS IT LOOKED ALMOST HUMAN IF IT WASNT SO TALL AND COVERED WITH HAIR .  IT COULD HAVE BEEN SOME DEFORMED PERSON.  I THOUGHT A CROSS BETWEEN A GORILLA FACE AND HUMAN WITH BIG LIPS FLATTENED TYPE NOSE (NEGROID TYPE I GUESS THATS THE RIGHT DESCRIPTION NOT MEANING TO BE DEROGATORY).  IT JUST STOOD THERE LOOKING AT US.  I GRABBED MY FRIEND AND YELLED  LOOK! HE GOT UP AND PICKED UP THE BOW AND AN ARROW AND SAID ''WERE GONNA BE RICH''.   HE WAS GOING TO KILL IT.  I LOOKED BACK AT IT.   IT STILL DIDNT MOVE  - NOT A MUSCLE, SHOWED NO FEAR AT ALL , COMPLETELY CALM,KEPT CHEWING .  ANYWAY IT LIKE SOMEHOW TELEPATHICALLY TALKED TO ME AND SAID-IF YOU HURT ME IM GOING TO KILL YOU BOTH.  I FREAKED OUT AND STARTED SCREAMING '' ITS GONNA KILL US,  ITS GONNA KILL US''  AND GRABBED THE BOW OUT OF HIS HANDS .  WE THEN TURNED AND RAN FOR OUR LIVES.<BR>WE TOLD OUR PARENTS WHO SAID QUOTE WHAT ARE YOU GUYS SMOKING.  ANYWAY,  BECAUSE OF THE UNBELIEVABLE CURCUMSTANCES (MAINLY THIS WAS A CHEMICAL PLANT WITH ARMED GUARDS)  WE THOUGHT MAYBE THE GOVERMENT WAS INVOLVED OR SOMETHING AND WE DIDNT TELL ANYONE FOR YEARS.  I HAVE TALKED TO SOMEONE WHO WORKED THERE AT THE TIME AND THEY SAID THEY DID WORK FOR GOVERMENT- JET FUEL ADDITTIVE-WHEN I TOLD HER ABOUT BIGFOOT  SHE LAUGHED AND SAID THEY HAD NO BIGFOOTS.  (I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS CAPTURED ONE/TRAINED OR SOMETHING) .  SINCE THEY HAD ARMED GUARDS PATROL, ONLY PLAUSIBLE EXPLANATION I''VE COME UP WITH WAS A PERSON DRESSED UP IN HOLLYWOOD QUALITY BIGFOOT COSTUME TO TRY TO SCARE US AWAY.  THAT DOESNT EXPLAIN THE TELEPATHIC ENCOUNTER.  I THINK IVE SPENT A LONG TIME TRYING TO RATIONALIZE<BR>THIS AND HAVENT COME UP WITH ANY REASONABLE EXPLAINATION <BR>",

It was winter time and it was also in the evening around 7 p.m. and raining. They were driving down route 24 near the Angola light when something ran across the road on all fours. Then when it got across the road to the field they both said it stood up and it had red eyes. I just started to watch the television show finding bigfoot and remembered that night and called my brother up again to get the details to see if I remembered it right.",

    " I was coming home from a night class at Del. Tech.  I usually take a back road over to route 9 to get home faster.  So i left college and made my way home on my normal backroad detour.  I got throught the first half of the twisted road and came up on the stop sign to turn right on to Asbury road.  As i did i turned on my high beams.  I came around a turn that leads to about a quater-mile, or a little more, stretch of road.  About 3/4 of the way down the road i could make out a standing figure next to a utility pole.  So immeadiatly i turned off my high beams, thinking it was a person because it was standing up.  As i got closer to this being i was taken back by its size.  I started to slow down not knowing it, i guess because i was puzzled and curious.  As i stared I could make out its bottom side, broad shoulders, the fact that it was standing with its back to me looking into the woods, and hair that came to a point at the top of its head.  This entire figure had a thick black cover of hair, with no hair on its hands.   I could not see its feet.  Standing next to the utility pole gave me some reference for height.  I estimate it was aorund 7 to 8 ft tall.  I was almost past this creature when it looked at me and then looked back to the woods as if it did''nt care i was there.  Once i made eye contact the hair on my arms stood up and i peeled out of the location.  I was confused as to what just happened and could''nt believe what i witnessed.  It also is hard to comprehend that i have seen a bigfoot and I have seen something that does''nt exist. ",

    " BACKGROUND<BR>My 18-year old son and I departed Cape Henlopen State Park on the Atlantic Coast near Lewes, Deleware at about 1:30AM, June 7, 2003, after a day of fishing from the park''s 1/4 mile long pier. We had intended to catch a couple of hours sleep in my extended cab pickup before starting the two-hour return trip to our home outside of Annapolis, Maryland.  However, we both managed to catnap in our fishing chairs throughout the day, did not feel the least bit tired, so decided to depart immediately for home.  Route 404 is the most direct route from Lewes to the Chespeake Bay Bridge and Annapolis, meandering though the Deleware and Maryland countryside, with only two small-to-middle sized towns (Denton and Georgetown) along the route.  The remainder of Rt. 404 is bordered by farmland (chicken and dairy production) and woodlands.<BR><BR>DETAILS<BR>I was driving and my son was in the passenger seat. We departed the park via Rt. 9, headed north a short distance on Rt. 1, and picked up Rt. 404 West . There was very little traffic on this secondary road at this time of morning, so I drove with my highbeams on and set the cruise control. Within a few minutes I saw a movement along the right side of the road about 100 yards ahead and began braking.  A doe stepped onto the berm of the road and crossed from right to left. I continued braking, almost to a complete stop, in case more deer followed the doe, but she apparently was alone.  Another few minutes passed before we saw a car approaching from the opposite direction. We could see its headlight glow before we could see the car itself because we were approaching a gentle curve in the road to the right. I flicked my headlights to lowbeam and in a matter of a few seconds saw the silhouette of a large biped cross the road, from the center part of the road, across our lane of travel, and enter the woods to our right some 100-150 feet ahead.  My son immediately exclaimed, \"What the heck was that?!?! I asked him if he saw it too and he said, \"Yes, there were two of them!\" \"Two??, I asked and he said, \"Yes, a tall one in front and a shorter one 4-5 feet behind.\"  My truck has almost slowed to a complete stop by this time because my foot was on the brake as soon as I first spotted the creature.  My son and I slowly drove by the spot where they appeared to enter the woods, but we could see nothing.  The car that was approaching passed us at this point, without slowing down or stopping.  I asked my son to describe what he saw. He said a large thing walking on two legs with another, shorter thing following behind. He added that the shorter one was about chest high on the larger one.  My son is near 6'' tall and he said the larger one was taller than him.  I saw the taller one, side profile, as a silhouette -- almost a shadow.  It moved across the road quickly, in a purposeful manner.  I could see no arms or arm swing.  It did not turn its hear to look toward us.  I could discern no color or body features beyond a head, torso, and legs. There was no accompanying odor.  When we passed what we believed to be the creatures'' entry point in the woods, my son''s passenger side window was completely down and mine was partially down. A normal moist, woodsy night time odor was all we noticed.<BR>Additional observation by my son, in his own words: My father saw one thing cross the road, while I saw two.  I use the word \"thing\" because I truly have no idea what I saw cross the road that night. They were NOT quadrupeds. The larger one walked upright and at a smooth pace...no bouncing around. It didn''t seem to speed up as our truck approached. When the oncoming car drew closer to the curve in the road, I then saw the second, shorter one in the glow of the other car''s headlights. This second, shorter thing followed closely behind the larger thing. I could see that it wasn''t standing straight up, like the larger one, but was slightly leaning forward. The siloette of both things appeared fuzzy, like a picture out of focus. My Dad said he didn''t see arms or arms moving, but I could see long arms moving back and forth on both things. The arms didn''t move very much, but I could see them. I don''t mean to make a joke out of what we saw, but the big thing could have looked Yao Ming, the Texas basketball player from China, eye-to-eye.<BR><BR>COMMENTS<BR>When I first put this encounter down on paper, I described what I saw as a shadow, not as a silhouette.  While silhouette might be a more appropriate word, I cannot put the illusion of a shadow out of my mind.  After talking this over with my son, we believe that the creatures that we saw did, in fact, have hair on the body and that a combination of (back)lighting from the car approaching in the opposite direction and my own lowbeam headlights caused the outline of the creature that I saw appear shadowy or diffused --perhaps a result of light shining on or though its hair. This, perhaps, can be supported by my son''s description of the silhouette of both creatures appearing fuzzy or out-of-focus.      ",

    " Our family was driving home from vacation last August when I saw something unusual in a cornfield. We were roughly 40-45 minutes north of Bethany Beach, Delaware traveling on Route 1 passing through farm country at the time.  We had rented a minivan and my husband was seated upfront driving with his Father next to him in the passenger''s seat. They were busy talking.  My daughter and mother-in-law were seated in the row of seats behind them.  My mother-in-law was reading a book to my daughter at the time.  I was seated in the very last row of seats in the minivan and sat on the passenger''s side of the car.  <BR><BR>As we were driving along and everyone else was busy either talking or reading, I was looking out the window at the passing countryside.  We were going through farm country at the time and as we drove past one corn field, something caught my eye.  The thing that initially got my attention was the fact that the corn stalks were now dried and yellow and it appeared that something dark brown was standing there in the middle of the corn stalks.  The roadway was slightly elevated above this particular field so I was essentially looking down onto the tops of cornstalks rather than them being level with the van.  <BR><BR>Having an interest in the subject of Bigfoot, I immediately went into observation mode and noted the following:  What I saw was medium to dark brown in color, it was taller than the cornstalks, it appeared to be about 3 feet wide and I may have been looking at a head and shoulders and it definitely wasn''t a piece of farm equipment, a scarecrow or a human.  In fact, I noted that there were no humans around on the farm at the time.  I was able to observe this for roughly 5-10 seconds as our minivan drove past this large field.  The brown \"thing\" was roughly 300 feet in off the road in the cornfield by itself.<BR><BR>I quickly tried to note the general location of where we were at the time.  I do not live in Delaware and was not familiar with the precise location.  However, not long after that, I spotted a sign for the Milton, Delaware exit off of Route 1.",

    " My father and mother were vacationing in the Mt. St. Helens area last summer (June 98) when Dad pulled over at a washed out creek up past the Lava Canyon to video tape the creek where the explosion from the St. Helens blast washed out the creek. He was video taping on a small bridge where the road crosses the creek, narrating what he was seeing. He said, while standing there taping, he could hear beating of stick on wood from the forest to the left and a return pounding from the stand of trees to the right. He progressed further onto the bridge to hear for sure that it was not an echo, which he was very confident it was not.<BR><BR>Further, since it was midday on a weekday, traffic in the area was none existant and no people had been seen for miles around. Nor were there any electrical lines or etc. in the area, nor work crews, nor loggers, nor hikers that would have been making these noises. My father is not easily scared, I mean that, and he was worried a bit about his safety at this point because of his certainty that the two separate noises were being generated in communication with one another, (left then right, then left at random spaces not exceeding moments apart). He had the video camera rolling throughout the experience and when I reviewed it the pounding noises of wood on wood are audible on the tape, if somewhat indiscernable.<BR><BR>I then interviewed my Dad on my camera that evening to document the occaision. I might add that he said the stick being used to pound the trees or whatever was a heavy (thick) stick that made a deeper sound than the crack of a small stick would make, (hinting that the size of whom ever were pounding must be considerable). Dad stopped rolling tape and got back in the idling truck fearing for his further safety. We have a copy of the tape he made and the interview I made. I would like an audiologist to examine his recording to single out this beating noise and record the intervals and strengths of the beats.",

    " I lived at Scenic near Stevens Pass Washington in the 60--70''s.  There had been sightings of sasquatch near our home, and at that time my husband and I laughed about that never taking them seriously.  I lived at Scenic about 10 years and enjoyed taking walks by myself with my samoyed dog. That dog would chase bears away, running them up trees. I always felt safe with her around.  One morning, the dog went with my husband to work and I decided to take a walk down to the end of the road towards highway 2. It was a beautiful spring day and the snow still lay in places on the ground.  I can still see and hear this like it was yesterday.<BR><BR>I had crossed the small bridge going over the small creek by our place and gotten almost to the end of the road where it meets the highway.  That''s when I heard the most god awful sound.  I can still hear it in my mind. The sound was quite close to me. I''m thinking about 1/2 block distance (as the crow flys) and seemed to be coming around the area where the deserted railroad bunkhouses were located across where the depot was located.<BR><BR>This animal had huge lungs. The volume was immense.<BR>(I''m trying to think of a word for the sound) It started sort of like roar and went to a shrill pitch. Then a pause of about 3 seconds and then the same sound with that shrill pitch, a pause of 3 seconds and another sound.<BR><BR>That was it and since I didn''t believe in saquatch I wasn''t scared of it, ,just curious. I knew all the calls of the animals around our mountains and this wasn''t the same. I''ve tried all these years to figure out what made that noise. I stopped into the forest service office after this happen and asked them if they had ever heard this sound. I was trying to explain it to them as best I could, but they never took me serious. I recieved the same response from my friends that lived in skykomish.  Then after I moved to Spokane some time later I was watching \"Unsolved Mysteries\". They played sounds that sounded very similar and said to myself \"there''s the sound or closest to it\".  I thought, \"no one''s going to believe this!\"<BR><BR>I worked at a hospital in Spokane and one of my indian patients and I got to talking about my experience. She had seen a sasquatch come into her camp as a young girl and chased it away by beating on a drum. She said the most astounding thing she remembered about her experience was the human look in it''s eyes. So the native americans have known about them for years.<BR><BR>I truly think the sasquatch would be found around that area of Scenic, near Stevens Pass Washington. For 10 years I walked all through those mountains, my small children with me and these sasquatches never bothered us.",

    "General Location: A government operated wildlife research station in a major river drainage which empties into the Chesapeake Bay.The **** was established as a wildlife research refuge in 1936. Prior to 1936, it was a large privately owned family estate (since the 18th century) and partially owned by the defense department in the early 20th century. The refuge area has largely been left untouched and never encroached by development, large scale farming, logging, or citizens. Farming was limited during the 18th century as the family line became very wealthy and used the massive area as a private estate for family members from the 19th century onward.Specific Location: Central Tract (extremely secured, gated and guarded area that is off limits to all citizens that are not employees)This area has been dedicated to bacterial, viral, pesticide, endangered species, natural resources, and migratory bird research for over 50 years. This tract is nationally famous from Rachel Carson''s \"Silent Spring\" book and the research which uncovered and revealed the extreme dangers of DDT and other pesticides. There are many old small research buildings trickled throughout the center portion of the tract. Surrounding the core of research buildings there are lots of very rare trees (true Chestnut trees, next to genetically modified Chestnut trees) and endangered plants. Beyond this core to the east are many mitigation research ponds and closed areas which breed endangered birds. The majority of the central tract is dense forests, streams, rivers and ponds.",

    "Biologist has multiple experiences at government research facility near Laurel",
    :otherstories
    "Yes, there are many incidents in this direct area. Most of the accounts are within a 5-10 mile radius. These accounts seemed to have started in the 1970''s when regional mass development began outside of DC and north towards Baltimore along the I-295/I-95 corridors.I will list some of the accounts which I am familiar with:1. During the 1990s a man driving home from work very early in the AM, spotted a dark bigfoot like creature hunched on the side of route 198 just off of I-95. As he drove past it stood up and ran off along the road jumping the guard rail.2. During the early 2000s, a lot of sightings of a large brownish black creature along the ******** River from I-95 downward into the ****. Government biologists from **** investigated and confirmed it was a black bear. However, many observers said it was bipedal and not on all fours. Many locals around the **** claimed whatever it was took \"refuge\" in the ****.3. Sightings during the building of Arundel Mills Mall in 1999, reported a large dark haired creature on the construction site. This report can be found on many sites and newspapers. This location is 10 miles north.4. On my first day on the job at the ****, I met with my direct manager, a senior staff member, and he said to me (his exact words), \"We do not discuss Bigfoot around here. Got it?\" (I realized instantly he was covering some thing up). He then said, \"We have a citizen in the area that from time to time sends us audio recordings and \"evidence\" that a Bigfoot lives on the ****. He often puts in for permits to come in and investigate. Never speak to him if you see him around the visitor areas.\"5. During my first driving tour through the refuge, a biologist from **** made the following statements to me. (We had reached the security gate which closes off River Road to everyone.) The biologist said to me, \"This is where the Bowie goatman lives you know? or a Bigfoot. That is if you believe in that stuff. And by the way welcome to your research area, have fun.\" I responded with, \"No matter, nothing in nature scares me.\" He then looked seriously at me and said, \"Until you get to see one.\"6. One day, several weeks after starting my work at the refuge, I was eating lunch in the office area that we share with **** police. One of the police said to me, \"Hows it going out in the hinterlands?\" I said, \"Fine. No one bothers me and its quiet out there.\" He then said something to the regards of, \"Seen anything creepy or odd yet? That is a strange area.\" I said, \"No\" (however I had already had strange experiences out there, but I did not want to mention anything in case he was testing me). He then mentioned briefly, \"I saw something like a huge dark bear walking on two legs one late night out on River Road, while doing a very rare drive through. I never went back through that place at night again. Only in the day light now.\" I just smirked and mildly laughed and said, \"Bowie goatman, eh?\" He said nothing after that.",

    "I have one major noteworthy aspect that I feel may be of importance. Before writing this report I did not of even think this was important, but now I do see a correlation.Earlier that same day, in the early morning (at dawn, this is when I started my work everyday), I began for the first time, data collecting on the island which the sounds came from.As I was collecting data on the edge of this very channel between the islands, the loose muddy bank gave way beneath my weight and I fell loudly into the water. I dropped my Geo XT GPS/CPU unit as I hit the water. (Luckily, it was waterproof) As I went under I finally could touch the bottom and push off. The water was about 7 ft deep. Before thinking, I dove back under to retrieve my GPS unit which was day glow yellow (thankfully). Then I struggled for about 2 or 3 minutes grabbing roots and anything to help me climb out.Once I got back up on solid land, I laid there for a minute catching my breath. I was covered head to toe with mud. I started laughing aloud and talking to myself, as I must admit, it was funny. I gathered all my equipment that had remained on dry land and carried everything down to the wide open rock covered beach on the large moving portion of the river.Being as there was no one else out there, I removed all my clothes and washed them off piece by piece in the river. I laid all my clothes out on large rocks to dry under the bright sunlight. I did keep my underwear on however, but nothing else. While my clothes were drying I sat on a large boulder and ate my lunch.I put my clothes back on later even though they were still damp. I remember later that day returning to the office and telling my story. Everyone kept commenting with humor that I smelled like the river and earth. At that time I figured silently to myself, \"what the hell I should just stay the night out there, being my scents were completely gone and I smelled as pure earth.\"So I returned back out there around 5pm after everyone left for the day and my evening story began.",

    " I was camping on the largest of the river islands on the ******** River in the extra restricted area of the ****''s Central Tract. It is an old growth forest. The understory was mostly clear of bushes and brush. I would from time to time camp out overnight there. I always camp with nothing more then a sleeping bag on the ground. While on the refuge I would not light fires, not cook food, not play music; just pure silence, meditation and observation.<BR><BR>Late on this one evening in late July, I heard wood knocking or clapping in the distance from the south portion of the river. I instantly thought of Bigfoot (I must be honest, especially after all the activity I had observed throughout the months prior). I had a large stick with me, so I slapped it against an old tree. At first I heard no reply. I repeated the banging once every few minutes until I did got a response of knocking back. This was in the same location as before. It then returned to silence until about 15 minutes later when another knocking occurred.<BR><BR>About an hour after the wood knocking I heard definite bi-pedal footsteps walking very slowly. The footsteps were obviously coming from something which was being very cautious. The creature was approaching from the south where the wood knocking sounds were coming from. I assumed that it was on the next island downstream (which is separated by a narrow deep channel of water 15 ft across by 6-10 ft deep). I remained silent the whole time as to not scare it off. The next thing I heard was a loud \"kerplunk\" of something falling or dropping into the water channel.<BR><BR>Around 15 minutes later I heard a few faint footsteps walking away back to the south (these steps were not as gentle or cautious as before). It sounded as if it were tired of the game or just leaving because it investigated what I was doing. The rest of the night was silent.<BR><BR>Following morning:<BR><BR>The next morning I went over to the next island at the break of dawn. I found no obvious footprints or evidence.

    "This individual occurrence was on a riverine island on the **** River located in the center of the restricted, non-access preservation area. The island is completely old growth forest which is mostly brush free and wide open under the dense canopies. The old trees (sycamore, white oak, ash, tulip poplar, red oak) are all 40-90 inch DBH (diameter at breast height) with the lowest branches being ~30 ft. or more off the ground. The age range is 150-500 years old.The canopy is so full that it restricts sunlight to the forest floor. Even during the brightest day on the island it feels like dawn or dust. The ground is full of rich black soil and a nice bed of fallen leaves. Scattered throughout the floor are various forms of edible and poisonous mushrooms. Where holes in the canopy allow sunlight in, there is patches of low bush berry, green briar, and other shrub like vegetation.The entire fringe of the island where sunlight reaches all day is full of smaller trees (pawpaw, young ash, oak, birch, maple, sycamore, cherry, holly) and under which is dense shrubs (ivy, lespidesa, barberry, green briar). Beyond the islands edge to the east side is a ~10-15 ft. wide weathered rock covered beach on the river side. On the opposite side to the west is a muddy steep bank which drops into a deep channeled branch of the river (10-15ft deep).This island very commonly has deer and wild turkey passing through and nesting down.Also an abundance of box turtles lives on this island.

We lived up off of Brock Bridge Road parallel to the Baltimore-Washington Parkway and one evening out with the dog out back - our home backed up to woods - I hear a rustling noise behind what was a drainage pond for our community. It was summer and the sun was getting ready to go down so it was dusk-like -- I turned - and by the way so did the dog - our Labrador Retriever -  and could not believe my eyes. I observed a large - I am guessing 10-11 feet high - ape-like figure stalking in the woods behind the pond - I would say it was about 100 yards away.  I just froze - and so did our dog.  No one else witnessed this and we just both stood there for what seemed like 2 minutes - until the creature turned and looked our way and then slowly turned and dashed back off in to the woods....never to be seen again.

    " I am a 44 yr. old woman, I am submitting this in request of my husband & grown son.  As an avid ''birder'' (loves bird watching), I was taking an early morning walk (6:45 a.m.) around Oxbow Lake to see what birds were ''out & about''. <BR><BR>Almost as soon as I started the short trail around the lake, I noticed that there was no activity.....none, no birds, no deer, no squirrels, nothing. This seemed VERY odd to me, because it was a beautiful spring morning, the sun was shining and there wasn''t even the smallest breeze in the air. Then I noticed that the birds weren''t even singing, I could not hear one bird song or call, which is very unusual because there is ALWAYS a lot of bird activity here, especially in the early morning. Then, I noticed that not even the frogs, or the peepers were making any sound...it was complete silence.<BR><BR>When I reached the part of the trail where I usually see deer, there was nothing. It was just about in this area where I started to smell this terrible odor....hard to explain, a strong musky smell, not like a dog or a skunk but a definite heavy odor of musk, one I have never smelled before and I have spent a lot of time in the woods. While I was standing quietly trying to figure out what/where the odor was coming from, a live tree 30-40 ft. high (unknown species) fell about 100-150 ft. from me, it just fell, and there was not even a small breeze that day! I have spent my childhood in the deep woods of Adirondack Mountains. and this just went against every natural law I could think of.....and believe me I tried to rationalize this!<BR><BR>I then had this intense feeling that I was being watched...no more like being stared at, and then I got the sense that perhaps the tree had been pushed, like a warning.<BR>I decided I should start making my way back towards my car, still not hearing or seeing ANY wildlife. Just before getting back in my car I went to an overlook and all of a sudden I heard from the opposite side of the lake a loud howling, it echoed thru the marsh area. After 3-4 deep, loud howls, again silence. I walked back to my car and drove home.",

    " I was bowhunting for deer yesterday (September 17th, 2005) in the swamp bottoms of West River in Churcton, Maryland when I heard what I can only describe as jibberish hollering coming from behind the deer blind that I was in at about 100 yards or so.  It moved east to west hollering jibberish and moving closer and closer to where I was.  I unzipped the back of the deer blind to try and see with my field glasses what was making all that noise and scaring the deer away.  I saw nothing.  The sound was getting closer and I began to feel nervous even though I had permission to hunt there. Thats when the smell of damp musty roadkill mixed with dirty diapers hit me.  I had to exit the deer blind for fresh air and an overwhelming sense of fear gripped me. It was more of a safety issue that made me exit the deer blind and nock an arrow in my bow and leave the area as fast as I could before I came in contact with whatever was making the noise.  I was unnerved by the aggresive tone in the jibberish and hollering.<BR>The fact that it was close by and I could not see it coupled with the smell and the tone of its voice, made me realize that I had best leave the area, and quickly.<BR>As I exited the woods, I walked briskly towards my vehicle and was approximately twenty five yards from my truck when I heard more loud jibberish coming paralell from me about twenty yards in the woods.  Whatever it was was following me and that unnerved me even more and I headed straight for my truck with my bow fully drawn and ready to fire at whatever was stalking me.  Again, I saw nothing.  No movement in the woods and I made my way to my truck and released my draw without shooting my arrow.  I put my bow in the back seat of my Suburban and cranked up my truck and left immediately.  I have never felt that way in the woods in my entire life.  I have hunted bear, wild pig and deer all of my life and never have I ever felt the need to flee the woods.   Until now.<BR>",

    " My friend and I had been searching for a place called Dickerson quarry in Dickerson Md, and had just located it on a map. We had to park on some railroad tracks by the aquaduct and walk through some very dense sticker bushes and overgrowth to find the place. To describe the quarry, it is located in the middle of the woods. It is about 75 yards long and about 30 yards wide with very tall cliffs, about 50 to 80 feet tall in some places. However there are a few places where you can walk down to the waters edge. As we were approaching the quarry, we heard this very loud screeching sound coming from about 25 yards away in the overgrowth. It was very loud and it actually startled us when it first started. The only way to describe the sound would be to say it sounded like a pig getting slaughtered. We stopped walking and waited but it stopped, whatever it was. We continued walking and found the quarry, hearing the strange sound several more times, always coming from a different place. We made a survey and located a place to go down to the waters edge to sit and rest. As we made our way around the quarry we heard the screaming again. Actually coming from the area where we wanted to go! We were not too alarmed though, being curious and stupid. We made it to the waters edge and sat down and started to look around and check the place out. I had picked up a stick off the ground and got out my pocket knife and started to carve on the wood. Suddenly there was a very large splash in the water. It sounded like a person had just jumped in but when I looked up could see ripples in the water where something had gone in. Figuring it was a rock falling from the cliffs we began talking again. About 5 minutes elapsed and we heard another splash. This one bigger and it was very far away from the edge. I asked my freind \"Did you throw something in?\". He said no, he was looking at me. We looked around to see if anyone was there that we didnt see but there was no one anywhere. We sat for about 5 more minutes talking and then heard another big splash. Neither of us saw what made it but the disturbance in the water was so big we guessed it had to be something big! We started to think that someone was in the woods and didnt want us trespassing and was trying to scare us off. However as we started to really think, we became aware there was no way anyone could throw any rock that big, that far. So we made the choice to go ahead and leave. As we were climbing up and out of the quarry another splash came from very near where we had been sitting and also sounded very big. We reached the top and started to make our way to the car. We only walked about 20 feet when something came crashing through the tree branches and hit the ground near us very hard. It sounded like a 20 pound rock hitting the ground. At that point we both stopped walking and turned and really looked hard into the woods. Neither of us saw anything. As we stood there listening, I swear Ive never heard the woods more quite in my life.  We started to walk again and the objects being thrown at us started to get alot more accurate. I remember saying to my freind \"What the hell is going on?\" His response was to tell me GO!!! We took off running and reached our only real obsticle, a creek about 10 feet wide where we had to cross on a log. I went first and he was close behind. As we where halfway across the log something landed in the creek about 5 feet from me that had to be the size of a paint bucket. <BR>I didnt see if it was a rock or what but it was big. At that point I jumped for it and hit the ground running with my freind right on my tail, neither of us looking back. I have never really felt scared like that, but that day I had the thought that we might meet something that was beyond nature and not live to tell about it. <BR> Our journey into the woods took about 30 minutes due to the high growth of pricker bushes, Our journey out took about 3 minutes! We reached the car and the only after the adrenaline wore off <BR>did we realize we both were bleeding nicely from running top speed through summer overgrowth. <BR>At the time, I didnt know about the connection between the rocks being thrown at us and the screaming to bigfoot, but it sounds like a classic case. Ive only been back a few times since then and only in the winter where I can see for 100 yards!!",

    " 11/20/12 I have been keeping my eyes peeled for any potential sign even though I live in a fairly populated area. I live on and drive up and down Carrollton Rd several times a week. What I noticed was a fresh break of a young tree, about 50-60 feet in from the road. Due to brambles, and being private property, I didn''t go in for exact measurements but I''m a pretty good estimator. This break is about 6 feet off the ground, maybe 5, the tree is approximately 4-5 inches in diameter. I noticed that there are significant scrape marks on one the road side of the tree, can''t see the other side, The marks are ONLY below the break. I also found what looks like definite depressions in the leaf litter, with a bit of compressed bare ground, one about 6 feet in from the road at the tree line, and one about 2 feet from the guardrail. I carry a tape measure with me in my car as part of my tools for farriery, so I was able to lay it out at what I believe is the length of the depressions and get pictures. <BR><BR>Of course I couldn''t resist doing a few knocks, there were some good rocks at the roadside so I did one knock, waited about 10 seconds then did two more about 2 seconds apart. I waited about two seconds, stood up, took two steps and heard a response knock!!! It sounded like it was certainly past the hill (top is about 3-500 yards from road) and probably well past that, guessing within a half mile. I waited about 30 seconds, put out a few more knocks, nothing. Couldn''t help a few short whoops, no response.",

    "Carrollton Rd runs a bit east-west at this point, tree break and depressions noted on north side of road, which is a very large (30+? acres) wooded private property, deciduous, lots of leaf litter. Thin brambles at tree line which is about 6-8 feet in from road, then the terrain is sparse undergrowth, with obvious (to me) deer/animal trails but no human made trail. South side, where I parked, has a bank upward about 7 feet (varies) and there is a line of planted pines. Walking up the road about 50 feet and looking around the south side, I did notice a big lay of fallen timber, several old 8-16 inch trunks together that would possibly make a hiding place if needed. This area in general is full of little gully creeks and feeder streams. Despite the presence of homes, I do not find it inconceivable that we may at least have some intermittent squatch traffic around here.",

There were also prints found in other areas of the state park and near Bel Air road. There was even a story I heard about a whole family on Whitt Rd. (right down the street) that had seen an 8 ft. tall creature on their back porch one night watching them eat dinner. When they started screaming, it took off. Also, all my friends and myself have grown up in the woods, and for years weve found mutilated remains of deer strewn everywhere (possibly by cougar) but I have doubts a cougar could do this sort of thing. I''ve also heard stories from a man thats lived in the neighborhood his whole entire life, and when he was younger his friends and him seen what they believed to be a sasquatch numerous times around the power lines, but it''s been a long time since I''ve heard the stories, so I don''t remember the exact details, but I can still get in touch with the man.",

It lies near the road, Piney Orchard Parkway, and railroad tracks but they are still used. Approximatley 2-3 a.m. we heard groaning and splashing in the water nearby. this was later confirmed later that morning though. When I heard the noise I thought it was one of my friends. So I peaked my head out to see but it was too dark so I yelled to \"shutup\" and the being ran away. Once again I thought it was my friends just playin around so I wasn''t concerned and I didn''t investigate.<BR> When the sun rose we started packing up and notice huge footprints in the sand that led into the trees coming from the water. The stides were enormous, we could fit one of my shorter friends who is 5''4\" between the prints easily. The size of the foot was very large about a size 19 or 20.

Theres a steam that runs by Shipey''s Choice and Ben Oaks across the road. At that time Shipey''s Choice was a new sub-division where homes were being built. The steam was at the bottom below two hills. I recall playing around the steam and following it back to Ben Oaks. I was alone and remember feeling like I was being watched. I looked up the hill in the area of the new sub-division about 250 ft. away and saw a bigfoot maybe 7-8 ft. tall. I didn''t know what it was at first. It was dark brown and big.

    " First of all this is the first time I have ever come forward in writing about this incident(s) that took place approximately 18-19 years ago.<BR><BR>Myself, my Uncle and a few hunting buddies frequented a 68 acre parcel of land in Street, MD.  One day we were conducting target practice (sighting in our guns) for the upcoming hunting season.  It was a warm, sunny day and off in the distance one of us noticed movement in a wooded area across Broad Creek.  It appeared that there was a large dark silhouette walking back and forth in the foliage.  Every time it walked back and forth it would stop and grab a hold of a large tree and began to shake it.  Keep in mind this was a calm warm day and no other trees were moving because there was no wind.  I thought it was very unusual behavior and must have taken an enormous amount of strength to be able to shake a tree of this size.  I peered through my 4 X rifle scope to examine the object more closely and observed it to walk upright and was covered with dark brownish hair.  Its head was large and I could only observe the upper half of the body.  When it turned, its arms appeared to be long and muscular and I could see that its back was very muscular too and had a \"V\" shape to it, which led me to believe that this was no bear.  It seemed to be agitated that we were there.  After about 15-20 minutes of watching it we decided to leave and never spoke of the incident again.<BR><BR>Additional things: In October just after dusk that same year on the same parcel of property my uncle was walking from the the dirt road area through a grassy area down a hill to the barn.  I heard him yell and call out to me.  I came running thinking he had fell down and I observed him on the ground with his tools scattered all over the ground.  I smelled a horrible pungent odor, heard heavy breathing and large foot steps coming from the near by wooded area.  It was dark and I could not see anything and I got an eerie feeling of being watched.  I got my uncle up off the ground and he told me as he was walking down the grassy trail, he heard long loud foot steps coming up from behind him.  <BR><BR>Thinking it was one of us playing a prank on him, he braced himself for one of us to jump on his back, however whatever hit him from behind knocked him with such force, he feel forward to the ground causing him to drop his tool box.  He said whatever hit him ran into the woods and was grunting and walking back and forth.  We both got flash lights and tried to look in the wooded area where we heard the heavy breathing but did not see anything but heard what sounded like bipedal footsteps go down the large decline and cross the creek at the bottom.<BR><BR>I am a trained observer and can only tell you what I saw.",

But on the way going back down the driveway, my folks stopped because one dropped something in the car. while our car was temporarily not moving, I curiously looked out the window and over toward the hillside, and i could make out the shadow and the eyes.<BR>I was 8 at the time, but I was rather intelligent for a kid- I knew what a deer looked like, what a fox looked like. <BR>Since that time in 1993, Ive heard sounds and reports of similar activity.

    " I came across your website, and decided to look for reports in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. After reading the posted reports, I thought I''d share the following:<BR><BR>I resided in the Annapolis area for approximately 8 years, from 1969-1977, and lived in numerous areas in and around the city.<BR><BR>In 1972-73, I was living in the Saferan (sp?) area, outside of Epping Forest, on the outskirts of Annapolis. This area was a wooded peninsula extending into the Severn River. <BR><BR>During the summer of ''72 or ''73, I was 10-11 years old. One evening I awoke because of the summer heat. My bed lay roughly 2 feet from and parallel to the bedroom window. The bedroom window was on the ground floor level and faced a roadway lit by a single street light in this area. I recall having just awoke and sat upright in bed, looking to my left at the floor fan. I recall thinking that the evening was very, very hot. As I sat in my bed waking up, I turned to my right, looking directly into the window. What I saw can only be described as a large head, with distinct hair covering it; it was much, much larger than any human head. I recall seeing the thing''s eyes blinking at me, from a distance of 2-4 feet. I also recall seeing the teeth in it''s mouth. The eyes and the teeth contrasted sharply from the darkness of the rest of the head. The light from the roadway was behind and to the thing''s left, so I wasn''t able to make out any distinct features, other than the eyes and the teeth. There were no sounds other than the fan. This thing was making no threatening moves, in fact it was doing nothing other than looking into my bedroom window and seeing me looking at it. After maybe 10-15 seconds, during which time I went from trying to comprehend what I was seeing to being very, very frightened, I lay back down on my bed, rolled off the bed to my left and crawled out of my bedroom on my hands and knees to a bathroom. My mother found me sometime in the bathroom. When I relayed the story to her, she told me the curtains were closed and to go back to bed. I know the curtains weren''t closed, but, thanks mom.<BR><BR>For what it''s worth.",

    " It was in at the end of August 2003. My self and a friend were fishing the Potomac River. We Were fishing between mile marker 57 and 58 off the C&O Canel. We parked in the town of Knoxville Maryland and crossed the rail road tracks to get to the river. We were fishing in a brach of the Potomac that was about 600 meters long before it went back into the river. We got to the spot around 8:00 AM we had our backs to the Potomac when fishing the banks of the branch. Behind us was the Potomac. There was an island that was about 600 meters long and about 200 meters at it widest point. The island is a hill and you can''t see the Potomac from were we were fishing. We were only there about Five mintues when heard what sounded like a dying deer. My friend heard it too, I said it sounds like some one shot a deer and it was dying. This whole time we were walking down the river and fishing at the same time. As I got farther down the branch of the river my friend said what is that alful smell. I said it must be that deer. <BR><BR>My friend said that is the worst smell I have ever smelt before. Then we heard some thing moving behind us on the island. I was thinking that deer is not dead yet. I started to walk across the water (which was about three feet deep) to the other side to see it. As I was walking I could smell it and it was getting worst. My friend said what is it, I don;t know I can''t see any thing but I can smell it. He started walking over towards me. He was walking with the river (south east) I was standing in front of a hill and could not see over it. Wear he was walking from he could see over the hill. I was about 50 meters down river from him. He said John I see some thing, I said is it a deer. No I think it is a bear. I started to walk back and towards him. I was hoping it was not going to atttack us. I said lets go some place else. <BR><BR>I wanted to fish not get attacked by a bear. He was walking to me and I was walking towards him I said lets go. Then were heard it again and I said that dose not sound like a bear.He said No but it might be a bigfoot. I said all the more reasons to go some place else. As I got to the bank acrossed from the island I got up on land to see if I could see it. He was still in the water but walking towards the bank wear I was standing. I could not see any thing but I did hear some thing walking on the other side of the hill. I said maybe it was a hunter and he killed a deer and now he is coming over the hill back to his car draging the deer. The steps were getting louader and I could smell the smell with every breath. At this point I am ready to run. I was a 4:18 miler in college and I was hoping my feet don''t fail me now. <BR><BR>It stopped and we could not hear it any more. I would have ran like hell if I would have seen a bigfoot. That might have been the day I went sub 4:00 in the mile. We left and talked about all day long. We still talking about it. He likes to tell the story I don''t go up that way much.",

    " In 1981, I was on the South Branch of the Patapsco River, approx. 1 mile downstream from Rt.32.  This section of river flattens out into riffles then empties into a larger pool.  I have fished this part of the river since I moved to Maryland from Pennsylvania in 1976.<BR><BR>I was fishing on the north bank of the river and noticed a stray large mixed breed dog showing alot of interest on the south bank.  This area has about 100 ft open area before it becomes wooded.  The dog suddenly started to bark and jumped at something that stood up in the brush near the river.  This animal, the best terms I can describe, stood approx. 7-8 ft. and had the shape of a slouching human, full dark brown matted hair covering the body.  The creature was making a ticking sound....hard to describe. <BR> The dog lunged at it and quickly was slammed to the ground by the creature.  By this time, I was wading across the shallow area of the river and caught a scent of this animal....reminded me of a heavy musk smell...kind of like that of a fox.  The dog ran away and the creature started to walk into the woods.  I tried to walk behind it, but I was in waders and lost sight of the creature.  I did see the dog a bit later and it had blood on it''s mouth and backside. <BR> I drove to a phone in Sykesville and called the police.  I was told to return to the scene and wait.  It took me about 3 mins to get back....and a police cruiser (State Police) was already there.  I was immediately told to leave the area.  I returned an hour later and noticed several state vehicles and one federal vehicle as well as police...the area was taped off.  I could see people combing the area....I was told once again to leave. <BR> I tried for several days to get answers from state official but never got an answer. I called WJZ, WBAL and WMAR about the incidents and each seem very interested.  I contacted each station later and was told that they had \"no idea\" of an incident and did not want to talk to me.<BR><BR>That''s about it....I was very frustrated by this.  I have reported this incident to only a few sources over the years.  If you have any information...I would appreciate it...<BR><BR>Lon Strickler",

    " I believe it was May or early June of 1985.  I rented a cabin in the Catoctin State Park with a friend and we just spent one night.  The cabin was just a simple one room building with a window on either side and a cabinet to store your belongings.  There were two army style cots on either side of the cabin, each near a window.  It was very rustic.  The door didn''t even have a lock on it, it was just a wooden latch that went through a slot on the door frame.  <BR><BR>My friend and I hiked during the day and then went to some store and bought submarine sandwiches and a bottle of wine.  As night was fallng we sat out on the tiny porch, ate the sandwiches and split the bottle of wine.  It was a very pleasant evening.  We sat on the porch and talked for several hours, but by the time 10:00 PM rolled around, the combination of all of the hiking and the bottle of wine made us sleepy.  <BR><BR>My friend and I turned in for the night and we both fell asleep very soon.  My friend is a very heavy sleeper, but I''m a much lighter sleeper.  At some point during the night I was awakened by something.  I didn''t know what it was, just that my sleep had been disturbed.  I lay in bed and just listened, starting to fall back asleep when I heard this strange cry off in the distance.  I had no idea what it could be having never heard it before.  I would hear a series of three or four crys and then silence.  Then after about a minute or two it would start up again, only sounding closer each time it started anew.  It was a very weird sound.  <BR><BR>I just lay there and listened and I kept thinking that the only thing that I could match it up with was the cry of a gibbon that I had heard on TV.  But I thought, that certainly can''t be what it is.  I''m not exactly an expert, but I''m a big nature lover and I''m fairly familiar with the common animals of Maryland and I just had no idea what the sound was.  Well, it just kept getting louder and louder each time the next series of cries started.  It sounded like it was maybe a half a neighborhood block away when, even though it was a warm night, I shut the window near my bed because it was so creepy.  <BR><BR>I tried to gently awaken my friend on the other cot, but to no avail.  I remember that I had to go to the bathroom, but was to uneasy to go out.  There was no bathroom, just the woods.  I stayed awake for about another hour and since I didn''t hear the cries anymore, I went out on the porch and urinated as fast as I could and went back in and locked the door and eventually went back to sleep.  I told my friend about it the next day, we had a laugh and that was it.  I have thought about it on and off all these years.<BR><BR>What prompted me to report it is that I saw and then bought the Discovery film, \"Sasquatch, Legend Meets Science.\"  There is this segment of the film where this older male scientist and his young female assistant are analyzing these sounds reported to be Sasquatch vocalizations.  When I heard the crys that they were listening to, chills just went up my spine.  They are darn close to, if not exactly what I heard that night in the cabin in Catoctin State Park. <BR><BR>I have never heard anything like that in the woods before that night or since, except the first time that I watched that Discovery Special about the efforts of those scientists trying to use scientific disciplines to prove or disprove the existence of Sasquatch.

    " In the Summer of 1970, I was taking my pony and dog for a walk in the thickly wooded area where my parents had just built a new house. It was at that time a very isolated area.  We had apparently disturbed the wildlife in the area as we were always seeing very large black snakes and other wildlife near the house.  I was not prepared, however, for the creature I encountered in the woods behind our home.  I looked up on the thickly wooded hill and saw a huge creature that resembled a gorilla or a bear.  It was dark in color and appeared to be hairy.  It was on the other side of an old fence from me.  I was very frightened. I fled the area immediately.  I wish I could describe this creature better.  I really don''t think it was a bear.  Bears are not usually sighted in our area and this creature was really big and it startled me because of it''s size.  I don''t frighten easily and was accustomed to living in the country with wild animals.  The one thing that does amaze m e when I look back on this incident is that my dog and  pony had no reaction to this creature.  It makes me wonder if they had become accustomed to it coming around when we weren''t outside.  I never saw it again but a couple of years later my mother saw something from her kitchen window that looked to her somewhat like a bear but she wasn''t sure as she was not close enough to it to see features.  It was on all fours and it got into the nearby stream and walked around the bend and out of sight.  The area where we had these sightings was in Washington Co. MD.  We live near a stream and a thickly wooded area.  The stream feeds into the Conococheague Creek which then feeds into the Potomac River a few miles from our home.  My parents have lived there for 30 years now and there have been no sightings of any creatures such as the ones we observed in the early 1970''s.  However, we were the first to really disturb that woods and the area is now much more developed.",
    :environment
    "This area is a thickly wooded area. There is a stream that flows through the area and it feeds into the Conococheague Creek about two miles from where the sighting occurred. The area is very hilly but not mountainous even though there are mountains about 10 miles west of the area near Clear Spring, MD. One strange thing about this area is that it is where a line runs that divides the limestone ground from shale ground and it is right on our property and just a maybe 150 feet from the sighting. The shale ground was covered with cedar trees while the limestone ground is covered by Oak and Sycamores for the most part. The area is near Cedar Ridge Road and along that road there are lots of huge limestones that are visible in the fields and many big sinkholes. There have been stories that these sinkholes are above caves that run from the Potomac River back under this area. The Potomac River is close to the area and the Conococheague Creek feeds into the Potoma c at Williamsport, MD which is about 4 miles from the sighting.",

    " This was at Davison US Army Airfield, Ft Belvoir Virginia. This was a while back so please hang in there with me.<BR><BR>From late 1977 to Dec 1979 I was assigned to Davison as a Military Policeman. The airfield is not that large and I am pretty sure it''s still an active military installation even now. The airfield is pretty much surrounded by a wooded area and part of the airfield is on a small swamp. When I started working there I was chided by other MP''s to be careful of the so called \"DUSAA Swamp Monster\" it was called. <BR><BR>We had to have a walking 2 man patrol a couple times a night walk the perimeter fence inside the field area. There were countless times while on those walking patrols that I occasionally made, where sounds were heard not only from the swamp area but also the wooded area along the south perimeter fence. By sounds I mean you could hear branches breaking, not small branches mind you, but I mean a VERY LOUD audible CRACK, you''d hear dogs barking in the distance and occasionally some kind of animal - which after hearing recordings on the net of a Squatch - they sounded AWFUL familiar! <BR><BR>Randomly I also had to pull guard at the main gate which is right there on Route 1 - the main entrance to the airfield. I''ve had the crap scared out of me more than I like to think about at that gate at night - you''re there all by yourself in a small wooden gate shack with 1 street light right above you and that''s it. Anyway, to the south in the woods I''ve heard bangs (what you all call knocks) and animal noises, I''ve seen deer running like all hell and jump the fence on to the air field in the middle of the night getting away from something and only 1 time, and it was 1 time way too many, when I saw a deer following the fence at about 2 AM one night and I heard something in the woods, I yelled out and I saw the red reflection of 2 eyes staring at me back from the blackness just inside the trees just out of range of the street light - I still see those eyes when I think about it and it''s been what... 34 years!!!  <BR><BR>One night, about 10pm, or there about, I had a civilian motorist come to the gate off highway 1 and ask me to call the State Police, I asked why and he said this big BIG hairy thing... yup he said thing ... walked across the road in front of him and headed onto Ft Belvoir property and he almost hit it. He thought at first it was a man in a gorilla suit but it was way too tall to be a man. This guy was shaking like hell too. I told him that it''s probably gone by now and the [troopers] probably would not find it. I had heard of other reports by motorists and even the State Police about sightings along Route 1 between DUSAA and Ft Belvoir.  This happened year round, almost any month of the year.",

    " October 16, 2012, between 2 and 3 am.  My wife and I were on our Honeymoon in Linden, VA. We rented a cabin for the week. During the night, I woke up to a sound similar to what I thought was our dog dragging a suitcase across the hardwood floor.  But she was in fact, in bed with us, on point looking out the bedroom window. The draggin sounds were long footsteps coming from outside. We listened to them for about 20 seconds or so as they were getting closer.  A silhouette then quickly, but smoothly, passed right by the window.  We quietly listened until we could not hear anymore footsteps, and then talked about what it may have been for a little while until we decided to just go back to sleep (our dog ALWAYS growls and barks at people, but she didnt, so we figured it was just an animal, or a tree limb swinging past the window).  October 17th, 2012, 1pm.  We decided to take a walk on the Appalachain Trail being it runs just a couple hundred yards from the cabin.  About 35 minutes into the walk, we both heard the most bone chilling growl.  It was so low in tone that we actually felt it in our joints and ribcage.  it lasted a few seconds before we high tailed it out of there.  There was no way after hearing that, that I was going to stick around, unarmed, with my family.  The growl wasnt loud at all, it was just bone rattling deep.  Listened to hundreds of soundbytes of animals to compare to, but nothing came even halfway close to what this was.  Ive personally heard wild cats, dogs, and bear through years of hunting, but this was something almost out of this world sounding.  Note that nothing was seen on the trail that day, but dont blame me for getting outta there ASAP.  All I could think about was getting back to the cabin with my wife safely. ",

    " In college, my social club would go camping twice a year for a bonding event w/ our new members.  We would go in Late November after the Thanksgiving Holiday and in Early April.  <BR><BR>A group of about 40-50 of us would set up a campsite w/ a large bonfire and we would spend most of the night in the woods just doing \"guy\" things like drinking and telling stories.  Invariably we''d get louder as the night went on, but it was a very remote area, not suitable for camping or any type of excursion.  We camped at the bottom of a large, steep descent that was a very dangerous rocky climb down.<BR><BR>Once we left the cars, even in full moonlight, the trees would be so thick it was pitch black and nearly impossible to see our way down so we were equipped w/ flashlights at all times.<BR><BR>All three incidents occurred in the same area, in the fall of 1994 and Spring and Fall of 1995.  The most unnerving occurred in the Fall of 1995 and caused most of our members to go home early because most feared we''d be shot at by hunters.<BR><BR>We observed, audibly, not visually, rock throwing and very strange howling noises that got closer and closer until we quieted down, then the noises seemed to abate somewhat.  <BR><BR>On the night in the fall of 1995, we camped next to a small stream that ran down the mountain and could hear rocks being tossed into it downstream.  We all assumed it was some of our guys since usually someone would wander off in hopes of scaring us.  This night though, it kept occurring so we sent out some of our guys to make sure we had accounted for everyone, and we had.  We had to keep a head count because we took as few cars as possible and didn''t want to leave anyone stranded.  Once we were all accounted for the noises got louder and closer and it was unmistakably the large rocks that dominated the hillside being tossed into each other and into the stream.<BR><BR>We all fell silent and the few hunters in the group told us it might be a buck just wandering the stream but then we heard a loud continuous wailing sound that no one could identify for certain.  We all, despite our intoxication and testosterone levels, got very very quiet and tried communicating back in hopes it was a hunter who was just lost.  As we called out into the night, more rocks were thrown and more odd noises occurred.  There were long wails, or howls and the occasional grunt, similar to what a large Ape sounds like when agitated.  Whatever or whoever it was, was agitated and was definitely attempting to frighten us.  After some time had passed, most of our guys decided they wanted no part of what we thought was a few hunters out to scare us, so most left.<BR><BR>About 10-15 of us remained through dawn, knowing that running wildly in the dark would be more dangerous than fending off some drunk.  We remained far, far quieter and heard more rocks being tossed in our direction, along with a few grunts but only intermittently and they seemed to grow more distant as the night wore on.  <BR><BR>On the previous two trips, I didn''t stay the entire night but on each one, we heard the same odd cries and rocks being tossed nearby at other rocks and trees.  We ALWAYS chalked it up to hunters trying to scare the college kids away but no one EVER replied and the screams and cries we heard were definitely NOT from a dog.  The fall of 95 trip was one that is most clear in my mind and the one that scared a big group of burly guys into heading home at around 2AM instead of staying the entire night as we usually did.  <BR><BR>It wasn''t until recently when my friend Randy told me about a BFRO expo in that region of VA that I even considered it being a bigfoot.  It had always been just a scary night in the black woods of West Virginia, but once he sent me a howl captured by a BFRO researcher, I had chills up and down my spine when I heard it.<BR><BR>Let me add that I am the worlds'' biggest skeptic and have routinely dismissed all Bigfoot talk as fantasy.  I don''t know what it was out there, but after reading about the rock throwing, the grunts and growls, the expo in VA/WVa and hearing that chilling howl sound byte, my brain tells me it had all the earmarks of a Bigfoot sighting.  It was eerie recounting it for Randy because each tell-tale question he asked me, I apparently answered in such a way that he was sure it was a Bigfoot sighting.  I am in no way convinced, but the circumstantial evidence is overwhelming.  ",

    " I''m an experienced outdoorsman, for what has been most all of my life. I was always 100% confident while in the woods, even at night. <BR><BR>It was mid August of 1985, myself and a good friend went camping in the George Washington National Forest. One of the most heavily forested areas around. At the time you would be hard pressed to find more desolation in Virginia than what we had. We drove up a fire road well past the few houses in the hollow. We made camp in a fire break between the mountains, but close to the bottom of the west ridge. I knew this little spot from previous adventures in that area.<BR><BR>After making camp, we went back down in the valley for some fishing, shooting, and some time in town. We got back to camp around 9:30pm. It was pitch black out, no moon that night. We couldn''t see a thing without the car headlights on. We finished unloading the car, and got a fire going. We sat around the fire for an hour or so. We had dinner, just some canned goods. We started talking, having a couple of beers, and enjoying the wilderness. Close to 11:00pm I personally noticed the woods were strangely quiet when all sorts of creatures should be making their presence known by now. <BR><BR>During a break in our conversation I heard the first of many howls. I looked at my friend and gestured to be quiet and listen. Then he heard it too. He asked \"What the hell is that?\". I shrugged and whispered \"I don''t know. I''ve been romping around these woods my whole life and never that before\". We zeroed in on the location of the howls, and they were coming from the west ridge. I estimate they were between 300 and 500 yards away. As I sat silent listening we began hearing crashing through the woods above us along with heavy footsteps. At some point I looked at my friend, who was a city boy and said \"That''s no bear, no human, and it sure as hell aint no siren.\". I could tell it was big, and I mean BIG! It was most deep, long, and carrying howl anyone could imagine. No man, animal, or machine could ever emulate this!<BR><BR>After 30 - 40 minutes of listening to this god awful howling. We decided to investigate. My friend was a well trained active duty Marine and I''ve never seen him unnerved, but he''s looking to me for answers I just don''t have. We both armed ourselves. We didn''t use the flashlights, because giving away your location is the first mistake. My friend had the 12 gauge, and I had a high powered rifle. In any other circumstance we would have had zero fear because we had brought a lot of firepower with us. But we were both visibly scared.<BR><BR>As we moved from camp and onto the road the fire light faded and we were in complete darkness. We kept close as we walked north. We separated a little and get some space between us so we hear more clearly. I was about 20 feet ahead of him. Even though our eyes had adjusted, we still couldn''t see any part of each other. I couldn''t see him from 5 feet, so we used sound to reference our locations. By now we realized this thing was pacing us to our west side way up the hill. The howling would pause at moments, and we could still hear crashing through the brush, and the occasional howl. I suspect we went up the road about 150 yards or more.<BR><BR>I whispered something like- I think we''ve gone far enough. It''s pacing us, and getting closer. He said something to the effect of- No kidding it is! We concluded camp was the safest place to be for the night. We made our way back side by side this time, and making no attempt to conceal our location, because it no longer mattered. it knew our exact location. I could tell it was no more than 200 yards away at this point, and closing in. The sounds of footsteps and breaking branches were more clear, distinct, and closer by the minute. It wasn''t paralleling us anymore, it was coming down at us in a slow zig zagging manner. I think we both knew the guns were pointless this moment, it was so dark we only would''ve shot each other by accident. <BR><BR>When we got back to camp we clutched the guns tight as we sat by the fire and listened. We kept pouring more and more wood on the fire as a deterrent and source of light. The little flashlights we had were never meant for the situation we had on hand. As we sat the howling went on and on. Sporadic at times, but never-ending. I started thinking to myself this has to be a protest to our presence. Anyway, we decided to wrap it up and go to sleep. As we lay in our sleeping bags in the tent we could hear this thing go on and on, howling and walking through the forest until we finally fell asleep sometime after midnight, or maybe even 1:00am. I knew full well it was no bear! Bears don''t howl, and could easily walk up right up on you in total silence.<BR><BR>Fast forward to roughly 1996/7. I''m sitting on the sofa with my wife, and we''re watching TV. Some show comes on about mysteries, unexplained etc. They play the Ohio Bigfoot howling. I shot out of my seat, pointed at the TV and looked her in the eye and said \"That''s it! That''s EXACTLY what I heard that night!''. She said something like- Baby, \"you''re white as a ghost!\" Sit down. I remember the white as a ghost part very well. <BR><BR>I wouldn''t go back into the woods by myself again for over 10 years, and only in daylight. Still, it would be over 20 years before I could sleep in the woodlands again. I had to do it. I was the father of a Cub Scout, and couldn''t let down my son. Aside from that I''ll never sleep in the woods again. I was 18 at the time, today I''m 52, and I know I was being stalked. ",

Talk about being petrified, because I sure was!!  I have lived around farm animals for most of my life and I know about what size this creature was, by just the sound.  It was bigger than a bear; besides bears can''t walk on thier rear-legs for that long.",

    "     I was camping at a spot called Big Slide just outside of Hyampom, California in Trinity County.<BR>There were at least five of us all sleeping on the beach of the South Fork of the Trinity river.<BR>    I woke up in the night, having heard something loud enough to make me sit up.  It was a bright moon that night and I could see across the river to the other bank quite clearly.  I saw a large creature on two legs shaking a tree.  It was a huge pine tree, I remember looking to the top of the tree and registering that it was a BIG tree to be shaking with such force.<BR>    I tried to wake the friend to my right, no one else awoke.  I had no doubt in my mind that I was seeing Bigfoot.  Everyone there knew Trinity Co. was a stomping ground for them.  <BR>    The river was running so I never heard any noise from it''s mouth.  It eventually stopped it''s tree shaking and ran down the beach in an arc and off into the woods.  I told myself that I would check it''s footprints out in the morning.  I went to sleep.<BR>     The next day I remembered it all like a dream coming back.  I took my biggest friend over to the other side of the river and we found the tracks in the sand.  We had him run into the sand from the forest and back out again, just as I had seen the Bigfoot do.  He was a 6'' man weighing at least 180 and his tracks shrank to about half the size of the prints that we had found in the sand.<BR>    We all agreed that it was odd.

    "    This incident occurred in the fall of the year, in Tulare county, Ca. The year was approximately 1955, plus or minus one year. I was about eleven years old, and on a boy scout camping trip. Although this happened to me a long time back, I now can remember it clearly. I say now because for along time I blocked it out of my mind. Sometime in the early morning hours I left the tent to visit the latrine, which was maybe fifty yards away at the edge of a small ravine. As I was standing there relieving myself I began to hear small limbs and heavy brush breaking just on the other side of the ravine. My first thought was that a steer or cow was over there, and I quickly directed my flashlight beam in the direction of the sounds. What I saw Froze me in terror. It looked to be about seven maybe eight feet tall, covered with long shaggy brown hair and kind of teetering back and forth on it''s two feet. The head was very large with no neck to be seen, and the eyes about ten to twelve inches apart,with round glowing orange appearance. The arms were very long, and hung straight down.<BR>I turned and ran back to the tent, wetting myself all the way. Everyone that I tried to relate this incident to just laughed at me, including my own family. Finally I just told myself that it didn''t really happen. Thats how I left it untill one day a few years ago I picked up \"The Bigfoot Case History Book\", and while paging through it, suddenly there was the picture of what I saw so many years ago. Not ape like at all, but what they referr to as the diving helmet type.",

A few of my neighbors say they have smelled them but not seen them. There is so much more and this thing is continuing.OTHER STORIES from Report # 20720: Yes, but I am not at liberty to discuss them because the woman who saw it was a Forestry employee.

    " My name is [TH], and I have lived in an old Mining Camp, in Northern California for the past two years. During that first fall I would hear a strange whistling call that would come from a Sequoia tree that stands out in about 2 acres of blackberries that surrounds my yard. The berries run down to a thermal spring on the property that itself runs down to I creek, which is around 50 ft. further up the hill from that creek.<BR><BR>I thought this was a stray bird of maybe a tropical sort perhaps lost by someone. It would call to me in a guttural clicking sound followed by a series of sing song chirping whistles. I would call back, and then it to me and so on and so forth for around 20 minutes to 45 minutes before it would stop. It was always at dusk towards night and so I would call it a \"night bird\".<BR><BR>There have also been numerous times that I smell a strong wet garbage smell that shows up suddenly in my yard and house. The latest incident is taking place around every few days now, at least for the last three and one half months. This smell shows up in the late spring and usually stays around off and on through the last apples falling from the fruit trees on my property. I rent.<BR><BR>I have sensed something looking at me from the steep hill across the road from my house that comprises my back yard. Sort of like the feeling one gets when a puma is near. <BR><BR>The other night I had an incident where the creature I am talking about banged on my trailer at around four in the morning. When I went outside on the porch to see if it was somebody, I had every single hair on my body go up instantly. I just knew that whatever it was; was right there. I beat feet into the house and locked the door. The early morning smell was so strong that I couldn''t even sleep. It smelled like a garbage dump. I have been around lions and have had the hairs on the back of my neck go up, but never anything remotely like this.<BR><BR>I have heard very heavy thumps coming down the hill behind my house late at night many times during these same seasons. They sound like very heavy footfall. There is one particularly loud thump that I can hear that I think I have identified as this thing as it jumps from the road next to my house down into the my yard on its way to the creek.<BR><BR>I have seen it twice now. The first time was around four in the morning when I walked out of my trailer onto my front porch. The door squeals so it makes a lot of noise and when I opened it I must have startled the thing.<BR><BR>At first I thought I had just seen the biggest bear of my life until it registered in my head that it was running on two long legs, crouched over. I noticed that it was swinging two very long arms. It was the fastest moving animal I have ever seen. [In 2005] I reported it to a place here called J.Bs deli and was put in touch with [Carmine (Tom) Biscardi -- a.k.a. \"the Great American Bigfoot Research Team\"]. They came and investigated and now I have a live video feed coming from two spots near the creek.<BR><BR>The second time I saw it was at around one- thirty in the morning a few weeks later. I noticed the apple tree in the far corner of my yard going berserk. The big branches were really shaking hard. I had a night vision scope so I took it outside and looked through it but the tree settled down and I did not see anything so I sat the scope down. When I looked back over there I saw a human form from mid upper arm up walking towards the creek at the edge of the berry bushes. The bushes are around six plus feet tall, and this thing was perhaps two feet taller. I saw large rounded head on very large rounded, thick shoulders. It seemed to have very little neck. I could see that it was hairy and got quite a good view because it was silhouetted by a light on my neighbors porch.<BR><BR>My daughter was staying in a tent out in the yard a few nights later and was awakened by some whistling and then by something hitting her tent. Like something had been thrown.<BR><BR>There has been a print found on my property also. It is around 19 inches long and about 8 inches wide. I have never seen anything like it, but it looks like a giant human footprint to me.<BR><BR>These incidences are ongoing. I think this thing summers here. What do you think? Also, do you have any suggestions on your experience as to how I may be able to study it or observe it here?<BR>I would be delighted at any input. <BR><BR>Excerpts from Report # 12910                                           October 27, 2005<BR>OBSERVED: I have new possible evidence on the hill behind my house that I and a few friends of mine have found, and we desperately want someone more qualified to look at what we have here. I would appreciate talking to someone ASAP so that I can connect with you for a possible story.<BR><BR>For two years I have heard a whistle and chuffing sounds coming from the berries bushes in my yard. I thought it was some lost big tropical bird. I would call back to it, and it would call back, and so forth. I have had some bad odor incidences including one that woke me up from a dead sleep and gagged me.<BR><BR>A volunteer found a footprint up the hill behind my house and some friends of mine, [T. C.] and [N. M.] found additional footprints and hand prints in an area up the hill from my house that appears to be some form of crude camp. I have been there three times now and the second time I went there I observed that some 4-5 inches around 4-5 ft. long branches have been brought from some where other than that location and laid in a sort of rectangle fashion around a depression in the earth. There are more of these depressions without branch borders in the area. <BR><BR>There are snapped trees at @ the 10 ft. level; there are \"huts\", for a lack of a better term made from big branches. Some look older and some look recently made. There are also snapped trees and tracks that seem to form a path from this site down the hill towards my house. [N. M.] Found two pretty fresh handprints that appear to be coming out from one of the \"huts\". The finger tips are spread much farther a part than a human could have done. We found three separate footprints there that did not seem to be very old, maybe a couple of weeks, but no more.<BR><BR>I saw the Bigfoot three times now, once at 4 AM in the morning, and twice at 1 AM in the morning. It was very dark each time except once it walked in front of a light and I got a good look at its height and silhouette.<BR><BR>Excerpters from Report # 20720:                                        August 09, 2007 <BR>It was four thirty in the morning as I opened the sliding glass door to my trailer looking east towards my yard and I Creek; I thought to myself, that''s the biggest bear that I have ever seen. As it stood up from the blackberries in my yard it was eating, I saw two long arms and two very long legs. It began to run north towards the path I have that goes thru the berries to the creek, and I said to myself'' \"that''s not a bear\". I knew I had just seen a Bigfoot. WOW!!!<BR><BR>I saw it run towards the creek and I heard it crashing through the bushes down there. I did not follow. I''m not usually a scared kind of person, but I did not follow because I was scared. I had never seen anything like that in my life. I live in the woods and I have seen lots of bears and large animals. I  consider myself good at estimating, so I estimated it as 10 to 12 ft. tall and it probably weighed somewhere in the neighborhood of 1200 lbs. no lie.<BR><BR>Later that day I went down and looked on the trail the way it had gone. I found horse hair ferns that had been torn out from an area of about a thirty foot radius where something had torn them out and made a large \"bed\", for lack of a better word, there on the ground near a natural spring that comes out from under a maple tree. I walked down to the creek and found the tops of two very large footprints in the sand at the very edge of the creek. The prints disintegrated into the water as I watched them, but I was pretty freaked out by then.  <BR>          <BR>On with the story...<BR>Every night for a whole summer I would smell it in my yard, it smelled like a mixture of wet dog, garbage and sewer...if you can imagine that.<BR><BR>One night the smell woke me up gagging. I thought it was a bag of garbage I had left out on the porch that night. You see, it is so much easier to stay in a sort of denial when you see these things. It really is too hard to believe what you are encountering. Anyway, the cameras were up in my yard at that point and I had these computers in my house so I sat down at the computer and started looking at my emails. <BR><BR>There is a window right next to my sliding glass door where my porch and stairs are. I heard a small sound behind me at that window while my back was turned away at the monitor and when I looked I saw a huge dark face in that window. The face was tilted slightly and I could make out the shiny spots at the brow and bridge of the nose. It was very dark outside and what I saw was the reflection of the things face in the light from the dining room. I looked at it and it looked back at me for a few seconds and then it turned away. A few seconds later I heard a loud bang as it slammed something into the end of the trailer. I looked later and found a big dent.<BR><BR>I got up and ran out onto the porch. I actually thought it was pranksters. I got out on the porch and noticed how dark it was in the yard at that point. I yelled, \"Get out of here!\" I thought that would scare away any kids that might be in my yard when suddenly every hair in my body stood on end. Have you ever been around a lion when the hairs on the back of you neck stand up, Yeah kind of like that, but about 50 times stronger?  I suddenly thought...man, this thing is right here in the yard with me. I promptly panicked...ran inside...and locked my door.<BR><BR>A few nights later I saw it walk across my property. There is a field light across my property in my neighbors yard and I saw it backlit as it walked down to the creek. I saw a tall figure...@12 ft. tall with large mounded shoulders and a sort of conical shaped head. I saw very long arms swinging as it walked. I could only see the top portion of this guy because it was walking by 8 ft. tall blackberry bushes.<BR><BR>I went up on the hill behind my house with a friend and we found a footprint up there. It freaked me out too because I wasnt expecting to find anything to tell you the truth. We made a cast and I would very much like to have that cast. I heard it is in litigation.<BR><BR>I have been up the hill above my house since then and I have found places with big holes in the ground where \"beds\" have been made. Some of them have crude frames in them made from 12 inch diameter snapped off branches that are crisscrossed to form frames. I thought that was strange. In those places there are numerous foot and handprints.<BR>",

    "There are two water features on this property that may be of interest.

It was perfectly still.  I almost felt it thought it was not visible to passing vehicles.<BR><BR>I went back to the area about 10 days later and saw some scuff marks on the bank side.

My wife and myself saw something rushing along the edge of the woods, Southbound, it glided into the woods as we passed. I said to my wife-\"did you see that deer?\" She said-\"that was no deer!!!\" It was a silvery-white, tall, vertical, slender thing with what she called \"flowing\" hair. Our \"sighting\" was about 3 seconds. This would have been utterly dimissed as something unexplainable, except we went back there the next morning, walked up to a cleared area with some very soft, muddy places. My wife got some poison ivy for her efforts. We found quite a few tracks, TWO DISTINCT sizes. Long stride on the larger. They were atleast 15\"long and about 8\"at the wide end. There were distinct toe markings on some. The shorter foot was about 9\" long with a more \"human\"look to the shape.

    " I had been working a swing shift at a paper press \"American Press\" from 3pm to 12 midnite, in the town of Mineral, VA (I think it was Mineral, in Louisa County.) <BR>About five of us were travelling home to Louisa, VA on not-too-isolated country road, when suddenly I saw something cross and go into the skinny forest at the side of the road. The first thing that struck me about it, was the way it moved. On a very primal level, I registered that it moved like nothing I had ever seen before; and my instinct on that primal level, was a gut-wrenching fear-reaction. Everything was happening very quickly, and the only light was from our headlights, but I noticed it was tall, and skinny, a dark figure with bad posture (a little hunched over.) Taller than any man I had ever seen, and I couldn''t figure out why a man would be at that particular spot, as there was not much around, and it was midnight.<BR>I turned around to one of the people in the van and saw she was staring at the same spot and I said \"Did you see that?\" She said \"Yes.\" She didn''t want to talk about it much, but I asked her what her first reaction was, and she said \"fear.\" When I asked her why, she said \"because of the way it moved, it looked like a killer.\" So then we talked about how something \"different\" would cause our first reaction to be fear, but the reaction soon after was of joy and wonder that we (older women, been there/done that) had truly seen something we had never seen before. It made us both smile, and I looked Bigfoot up on the internet the next day, as I had heard about sightings all across the US, but had never heard of them being around populated areas in the Virginia area.",

    " My two boys, ex-husband, and I were heading back to our hotel from dinner in Williamsburg, on the evening of October 22, 2020.  I took a left turn onto E Rochambeau Dr., which parallels interstate 64.  It was a clear night, dark and around 8:55pm.  I know that it was after 8:50 pm and before 9:00pm, because I was hoping to get back to watch the 9 pm debate.  <BR><BR>My son made a comment about my speed, and I pointed out a 55 mph speed limit sign, as we passed it.  I rounded a corner and saw a brief small glitter, which lead my eye to see movement.  I quickly could tell that it was an upright, bi-pedal figure.  As it walked quickly from right to left, I immediately could see that it walked like a human, but it was extremely broad and huge.  The arms and upper thighs were so big that I could see the outline of muscles.  The figure was blacker than black, almost looking like an enormous shadow figure, but solid.  My lights only revealed blackness, no clothes, just one solid figure.  I could see from the middle of the face and most of the legs.  I saw no features, as it was walking, only showing it''s side to me.  It moved smoothly and quickly.  I could not see it''s feet, or the top of the head.  <BR><BR>It happened so quickly that I didn''t have time to say look, to my family who was with me.  As soon as it stepped of the side, I immediately said, \"What was that?!\".  I was curious to where it went, and as I passed the area, I could see that it went into the woods. There were no cars, people or anyone else on the road.  There was one house a little further down the road that had a front porch light on.  I keep trying to understand the distance from my car to the area it walked in the woods, trying to understand the height.  What I saw was huge, no way could any human be as huge, tall, and broad as this.  Again it was black, so black, and my lights didn''t reveal details which is odd.  My children were completely freaked out, so I did not stop.  I''ve returned twice to the area to look at the road and surroundings.     ",

    " My wife and I were walking down the Great Dismal Trail which is the old Route 17 before they made a 4 lane version between Chesapeake VA and the North Carolina border. We had walked approximately 1 mile down the road and were sitting at one of the benches they put along the way. It was quiet and cool out, around 50 degrees. We started hearing what sounded like someone walking parallel to the canal on the other side. We heard the typical crunching sounds of leaves and twigs snapping. These sounded like the footsteps of a man (as in 2 legged). They started to our right as we faced the canal and in the span of about 5 minutes ended up being in front of us. Once the were near our center, we started hearing steps coming from the left side. We continued to listen as they seemed to be intercepting each other. A couple minutes later we heard what sounded like chattering or popping sounds from the center point and then the same sounds coming from our left. My wife and I were somewhat spooked at this point as we''ve never heard those sorts of sounds before. I was carrying a small, thick pine branch which I hit against a mile marker post a couple times to try to produce some sort of a response. About 10-15 seconds later we heard a similar sound come from the area of the footsteps but it seemed like it was deeper in the woods. The steps continued and it sounded like it was about to pop out on the other side of the canal. The canal is approximately 40-50 feet across and very deep at that point and the brush on the other side was essentially a wall as it''s so dense. We never did see anything but I decided it was time to leave. My wife was hesitant as she wanted to see what it was. We headed back to the gate of the trail and there was a park ranger sitting in his vehicle waiting to close the gates (the trail closes at sunset which is 5:00pm at this time of the year). There''s frequent blackbear sightings in this area so I asked the guy how bears typically sound in the wild. I told him about the chattering and asked if they could do that but he didn''t think they produced that sort of sound. We talked a bit longer and started towards the car. About 20 feet from the car my wife and I heard a loud but short scream coming from the direction of the swamp. The best we can describe it is a cross between a woop and a woman''s scream. My wife thought it was my cars alarm sounding but I said it doesn''t make that sound when unlocking the door. I have absolutely no idea what we heard but it was completely unlike anything she or I had heard before.",

    "We were on an old 2 lane road sitting on a bench between the road and the canal. The side which the sounds came from was very dense (to the point of not being able to see anything). It was large trees and lots of scrub brush. I have no idea what it looks like beyond the wall of brush on the other side of the canal. I do know the trees go back as far as the eye can see.",

    " After finally getting my twelve campers to sleep I left them with my co-counselor and took the short walk to the showers.  The time was 11:00 pm and everyone was asleep or at least in their cabins.  It took me 3 minutes to walk to the showers and on the way I didn''t notice anything unusual.  After my shower I stepped outside at approximately 11:25 to walk around to the other side of the building.  At this point I recall the sounds of the forest being stilled or a little subdued.  I also noticed that there were no sounds of the junior staff coming from the bunk house or pool as was usual that time of night, but it didn''t make much of an impression on me as I entered the other side of the building and grabbed my laundry basket.<BR><BR>  Coming back outside and rounding the building I heard something that stopped me in my tracks.  It seemed to be coming from a wooded area west of the bunk house and my initial thought was that it was junior staff playing around, laughing, and yelling.  But the sound seemed to be coming from one individual and was carrying very far.  It was a really loud howling changing into a type of whining bark and then ending almost like a hoot.  It was a sound that puzzled me because I am knowledgable in the sounds of wildlife and had never heard anything like it.  I also knew somehow that it was impossible for a human to make that sound, yet it sounded eerily human.  <BR><BR>Since I only heard it once I sucked it up and started walking out of the circle of light streaming from the shower building and towards the girl''s cabins.  Of course my cabin was the last one on the end and of course most people had forgot to turn on their porch lights.  None of this bothered me though until I heard the noise again.  It was a little closer and louder and it frightened me that it wasn''t just a one time thing as it immediately \"called\" again after the second time.  I wasn''t afraid I was going to get attacked or anything but it would be nice to be indoors so I started walking faster.<BR><BR>  The sound was repeating itself again and it sounded as if whatever was making it was getting still closer and paralleling my path.  I finally decided to break into a run and quickly reached my cabin, entering it.  The time that had elapsed from when I first heard the \"call\" til when I entered my cabin was probably a minute and a half since I ran some of the way back to my cabin.  I also didn''t hear anything else after I got inside but that may be due to the fact that I put on my discman to calm my nerves.  Also, the number of \"calls\" I heard in the elapsed time were about seven, some flowing into each other near the end.<BR><BR>  The next day I told the camp director and a few other counselors what had happened but they brushed it off as being a turkey or a dog and even though I didn''t know what it was, I knew it wasn''t one of these two.  Being a prankster and practical hoaxster wasn''t on my side because many thought I was joking.  When I wouldn''t relent with my story I was poked fun at and so I think anyone else that may have heard anything may have been discouraged from saying anything.<BR><BR>  I didn''t make this report sooner because I didn''t discover the website until a few months ago and I have been searching the internet for sound clips of wild animals to maybe rule out or make a possible connection with what I heard.  Everything I listened to was worlds away from what I heard, except for sound clips of supposed Sasquatch that were available on this site and some others.     ",

    " During early fall of 1981 when I was in 9th grade, several of my friends and I were playing war in the woods of the Petersburg National Battlefield.  We rode our bikes to one of the wooded fortifications next to a stream.  That was our base where we parked our bikes.  We would form teams and on this day throw pebbles for a kill when you found someone. So one team would wait three minutes while the other team hid.  During one of our breaks I was busting some softball sized rocks against each other in the stream to see the crystals inside.  After we were done, near sunset, we started riding back to the base housing and I remembered the rocks and decided I wanted to go back and get some of the chips.  So two of my friends and I doubled back and coasted downhill and then up the embankment.  We stopped at the top and upon looking down at the stream saw what looked like a black bear in the stream where I had left the rocks.  When it stood up on two legs, turned around and looked at us we all started screaming because it was not at bear at all.  Though we were 40 feet apart we did not see a face, but the smell was like road kill.  It then ran on two feet without making any sound that I could hear north along the stream faster than we could have rode our bikes.  We rode back toward the base and gathered older kids playing basketball and went back searching armed with sticks, rocks, and mop poles.  No tracks or other signs beyond a few more turned over rocks in the stream were found.  We decided it was either a Bigfoot or some advanced all over hair ghillie battle suit with six million dollar man powered legs.",

    " While on a training exercise in Ft. Pickett, VA., I was positioned in an observation point overlooking a camp. I was lying low in our hide providing over watch while my team member attempted to move in to within approximately 75 yards of this camp. It was at this point when three distinct knocking sounds spread no more than 1 second apart, were heard from our 6 oclock position. The distance appeared to be within 100 yards. After a very short pause of about three, maybe five seconds, there was the sound of a large branch or small tree breaking in half. The noise was so loud that everyone in the camp grabbed their flashlights and searched the tree line towards the direction of the sound. We were almost compromised by this noise, but as quickly as the sounds were heard, the forest fell silent. Unfortunately, no one was able to further investigate those sounds due to our focus being the exercise and not the wild life. <BR><BR>Approximately two, maybe three hours later, one of the cadre was listening to a range radio and overheard a conversation between an adjacent range and range control. The conversation spanned only a few minutes, but in summary it went like this: Range Control, this is range #... umm, there is a Bigfoot walking across the range! This range was only a few kilometers from our location.<BR><BR>Early the next morning, maybe 5am, one of the members of our team had to depart the training environment so he was given a coordinate to meet for ex-filtration. He arrived early and waited until the extraction team arrived. During his time alone, he commented that he heard loud foot steps behind him. He was not sure if it was a large deer coming to investigate or what, but he said it came very close to him. So close that he was hearing this animal breathing behind him only a little ways off. He said he felt uneasy and didnt dare turn around because his initial thought was that it might just be a buck that would become startled and attack him. A few moments later, the animal departed and shortly after he was extracted. He didnt want to think of this animal as anything but perhaps a deer. <BR><BR>After the exercise, we spoke with the role players about that night. They all heard the sound and thought one of us was trying to play a game with them or that one of us had fallen down the side of an embankment causing the loud noise. Once we advised them that it was not us, they just went silent and didnt speak of it any further. <BR><BR>The strange thing is that earlier that night I had this eerie feeling, like something was watching me from behind. My reaction at the time was to grasp my knife and prepare for whatever may come next. It never reached that point, but my senses were heightened and I found myself scanning my surroundings more often with my night vision. <BR><BR>Due to the nature of my work, I cannot go into great detail as to the exact month or day, but I can mention that it was in the early months leading up to spring. But I cannot deny that there is something other than normal wild life in the woods surrounding Ft. Pickett, VA. <BR><BR> <BR>",

    " It was about 2 a.m. on or about May 3rd 2011, I heard a noise as if something fell that was heavy, a thud sound in the back of my house. I thought it might be a bear or burglar. Me and my 21 year old son went out to investigate. I was armed with a pistol and my son had a shotgun. I saw a deer run as if it was being chased. Then I saw a huge figure coming out of the woods. This thing was at least 8 feet tall. I could not believe this! I screamed out to this thing to stop. It came towards us running. I told my son to shoot. He shot in its direction. It then ran to my left flank and continued to come toward us. We ran back towards the house. I was in terror because the thing was shaped like a man but was covered with hair. I do not believe in Bigfoot but I cannot explain this? I stopped and watched it walk away into the light and it was huge and there was an odor that really stunk in the air. It stayed in sight for about 5 minutes before it went into the woods. I investigated the next day and there are footprints that are about 18 to 20 inches in the field. Unless this is a hoax and someone was in a costume? We fired on this thing and it made a huffing noise and a shriek sound.<BR>I have followed some the prints and there is long hair brown and gray back in the woods. I have had more noise and sightings in the woods behind my home. I live in the country and unless someone is doing this in a costume then this is the real bigfoot. There is also an underground tunnel dug into the side of a creek bed. The prints lead into the tunnel and I am not going in there. It is not a bear because a bear would never charge a gun shot.  ",

    " I was in Junior high school for Crewe Junior High (no longer exists). I was riding on a school bus on a back road in Greensville Co. Virginia after competing in a junior high school basketball game with my teammates. We had lost the game so my coach had told everyone on the bus ride he wanted no talking on the ride home back to Nottoway Co. Well almost everyone on the bus was sleep or trying to go to sleep cause we could not talk. That is when I saw it. About 75 to 100 yards away from the road down a hill was a corn field with a scarecrow on a wooden cross in the middle of it. I saw out of the foggy window cause it was early winter a huge figure standing like a man with hair all over it. I could tell it had hair because it was thick and long from under it''s arms. It had to be about 8 to 9 foot tall because it''s head was at the chest area of the scarecrow on the wooden cross. It was huge and massive. It appeared to be looking at the scarecrow. As the bus drove by I sat up in the seat to try to get a better look out the window because I had the window cracked to get some air. I yelled at my coach and everyone on the bus \"did you see that?\". They all laughed and joked on me. I tried to get my coach to turn around to go back. He was so mad at the team for losing the game he told everyone to be quiet and not say another word or we would be running laps the next day. So I did not say anything else. What I saw that night has haunted me for a long time until today when I got a text message from my brother about an article he read from you guys about Big Foot sightings in Nottoway and Brunswick counties. My brother knows of the story I have told and wanted me to know that I was not the only one to have seen something like this in my hometown area.

    " My ex''s step father was born in Amelia County, Va, so my husband hunted a lot where his step father had family land there, I would sit in the car while he went hunting. It was getting dark [dusk] and I could hear children playing, but just over looked it. A few minutes later my husband scared me when he came up to the car from the rear, and eased the door open to put his shotgun in the back. He was uneasy about something, so I asked what was wrong. He told me to roll up the car windows, but leave a crack for air. He was scaring me, which he never did, he was scared of NOTHING. He pointed to a large tree in the field ahead of us. What I saw was the SAME animal you showed in the Dec 31, show [NY State]. It made the hair on my neck rise, and a chill go down my back, I still feel that fear even today. It looked like 2 of them, just crawling around a huge oak tree. One of them went behind the tree, then appeared at the base, and looked around the tree at us. Chills ran down my spine, and we started the car and we left. We were going to spend the night, but drove home to Lynchburg, VA that night. He never went back to that spot again, and it took him a long time to even go back there hunting.",

    " From the late 60''s to about 1990, my Dad took us camping many weekends in the summer to the John H Kerr Reservoir (hereafter know localy as Buggs Island Lake)wich stradles the Virginia, North Carolina border, along the southern border of Va and about half way across the state from the Atlantic Ocean to the Tennessee. This lake is very large, man made and 80 miles long, part of the Roanoke River and 3 miles wide at the Clarksville bridge. We had a 64 Ford Econoline conversion camper that we used to travel a great deal and camp in often. About 1970, my Dad found a farmer named Sam Buggs, that had turned a portion of his farm along a section of Buggs Island Lake into a permanent private campground with yearly leases on lots. Most People had campers or even large mobile home placed there in a semi-permanent arraingement. My Dad had sold the van and was about to buy a 23ft camper and was thinking of leasing a lot from Mr Buggs so we went to the lake with a couple of tents as I recall, around May of 1970. We had a typical family camp set up and had grilled burgers and such on the colman stove and then sat around the fire and talked and joked until we all went to bed in our tents, 3 kids in one, Mom and Dad in the other. I was 15 then and didn''t go right to sleep, but lay there a while and listened to the rest of the camp area quiet down and settle in for the night. The place within the camp that we pitched our tents that night wasn''t in a typical \"setup\" campground. We were more or less just in a spot cleared of small brush along side the tractor path that led down to the lake. The piece of lake that afronted the camp near us was just 25yds away. There weren''t any campsites within 50/75 yds of us, so it was really quiet by about midnight. I was laying there when I heard something rooting around in our trash. Now, let me tell you, I lived so far back in the country and camped and fished and hunted and just ran the woods all the time since our nearest neighbor was 3/4 mi away, that my Dad use to say we went camping to \"see\" people! Well, upon hearing the noises from the trash, I thought of the pet Racoon that I had just 2 years before and thought I would see how many were out there, so I grabbed my 6 Volt flashlightt to take a look. I very quietly (barefoot) sneaked out of the tent and looked over to where the trash was and pointed the light and then hit the on button. Well, what I saw was no Racoon, it was a furry creature, standing about 4 ft tall, standing upright (and I don''t mean on its''s hind legs), that jerked it''s head suddenly to it''s \"left\" towards me, about 20ft away. It had been looking over and into the trash bag we had hanging from a stub of a branch on a  sapling when I interrupted it with my light. As soon as it snapped its head to look at me, it let out a squeal/grunt and dashed away, where, I don''t know, because I had turned to run the other way towards my Dad''s tent, and I started yelling and shouting about a monster or creature or at least words to that effect, as well as urging my Dad to get his gun (former Marine and Sargent of Detectives in Roanoke Va). Well this generally woke everybody up and and probably a fair amount of the camsite too because I created quite a ruckus at midnight! Anyway, I must have had to tell my Dad that same story over and over 50 times, (That was the Detective in him) and I had him convinced that I''d sen something, but we had no idea what it was. Of course, we''d never heard of Bigfoot then, but a few years later, after many ribbings from my Dad, and brother and sister, we did talk about it one night and did speculate that just maybe that is what I saw that night. Now after numerous specials and much information about Bigfoot and Devil Ape and many other names, I am more convinced than ever that I did see a small one that very night. To be honest, when people ask me to tell them just what it did look like, I tell them it did resemble those Star Wars, creatures, the \"Ewoks\", except it was slim. The fur was a reddish/brown and reddish yellow(orange?) color, the face was more like a Chimp or Orangutan, (that was my thought that same night). I did look for tracks, but the whole area was trampled by everyone looking around that night, so I never saw anything that looked out of place.  Well, thats my story, it''s true, I was there and I''m a believer!  The strange thing is that it wasn''t until years later that I realized that if there was a young one there, that meant there was an adult one there too! I''m glad i didn''t realize it that night, because I''m sure I never would have finally been able to sleep. My Dad did put that camper in that camground, about another 50 yards further up the slight hill, and they camped there until he sold it about 1990. I joined the Navy in 1974 and spent most of my time far from Virginia and only camped a few time there while on leave. I never did hear any other stories about strange things, but I did witness one other strange occurance, in the middle of the morning one day, just a couple years after Dad put the camper there. Sam Buggs used to have a very friendly Bird dog, the name escapes me, but one day, mid morning, in the summer, I did see that dog walking over towards a large oak tree, maybe 3 ft thick at the edge of the campground (this was maybe 50/60 yds frome my Dad''s camper) and his tail was tucked, and he was acting shy and submissive, yet walked over behind the tree as if going to someone he didn''t know ( I saw him do this often to new people in the camp ground). Just as his head and front quarter went behind the tree he suddenly flew trough the air as if kicked right back the way he had come, landed on his back yelping and ran as hard as he could back towards the farm. Well, I was pretty angy that some one would just kick that dog like that and went over to that tree to see who had done it, and there was no one around......anywhare. I looked around but didn''t see any sign that anyone had been there, no boot prints....nothing. The ground there had been raked down to just a few leaves and mainly a hard clay typr surface for a mobile home that was put right beside that oak tree the next week. Anyway, this was 2+2 doesn''t add up thing and that the only other thing I ever heard or saw myself. US highway 15 crosses a finger of the lake about 5 miles north of the Clarksville bridge, near a boat ramp called \"Stoney Point\", the campground was about 5 more miles up that same finger of water. I have no idea if that campground even exhists now. Im retired from the Navy and living in Arizona now. ",

    " The year was 1972. A group of us from Roanoke Virginia were on our annual after football season camping trip in the George Washington National Forest. We did this every fall as a treat after a tough season of high school football. <BR><BR>We were in the North Creek Campground about 10-15 miles North and east of Buchanon Va. An area called Arcadia, between The Blue Ridge Parkway, the Appalachian trail and Interstate 81. We had the luck of getting what we called the sportsman''s shelter, one of only two in the area provided on a first come first serve basis. <BR><BR>There were 7 of us, and it was a Saturday night. The shelter was a 3 sided shelter with a wooden floor and raised approx. 3 feet off the ground. In front of the open side is the area for a campfire. At about midnight, we had gone to bed around 11:30 or so, I was awakened by a strong stench and a presence in the shelter with us. <BR><BR>We were all in sleeping bags, side by side with our heads against the rear wall and facing the large fire we had going in front of the shelter. What I saw made me freeze, I could not move even though I wanted to. I wanted to wake the others but I couldnt speak. The animal was standing on its hind legs and because the fire was directly behind it, it was a silhouette of a tall, 7ft. hairy ape like figure. <BR><BR>I remember the hair covered it from head to toe, but could not make out any facial features because the light was behind it. After a short time I felt a liquid splash my cheek and it took a moment for me to realize that it was urinating between myself and the guy next to me. Actually, it was urinating on the guy''s sleeping bag next to mine. The smell was very strong, pungent. When finished it stepped off the shelter floor and disappeared. <BR><BR>It literally took me about 30 seconds to a minute to come out of what I can only describe as a paralysis. My friend Tim woke up about the same time yelling that someone had urinated on him, and he was truly upset. <BR><BR>He had thought it was one of the other guys pulling a prank. By now everyone was awake and it was obvious that no one else had done this. <BR><BR>When I explained what I had seen, we decided to move from the shelter which was isolated to a campground about a quarter mile away where there were more people. We were all pretty big guys, all football players, and pretty tough, but whatever happened that night scared us enough to break camp and move.  ",

It takes a while to get to the location of the camera. The terrain is very unforgiving. We had stopped in the holler and the camera was on top of the ridge. My husband walked up to the camera to where I couldn''t see or hear him anymore. I was sitting on the four wheeler in total silence. All of the sudden I heard this horn like yell.

    " My girlfriend and I were standing in a graveyard on a ridge top in Eagle Rock, VA. on Dec 24.  It was rainy overcast day at approximately 4:50 pm.   We were paying respect to my families graves when all of a sudden we heard a guttural call sound come from about, what I estimate, 100-150 yards away, if that far up the mountain from us. It was low and lasted several seconds. There were 3 distinct calls in the initial call. My girlfriend looked at me and said, \"what was that?\"  I started to answer her with an \"I am not sure\" response when it called out again, 3 distinct calls.  She said, \"is that Bigfoot\".   I said \"I am not sure, I grew up in the woods  and Had never heard anything guttural like that before and I have heard a lot\".  I could see the fear in her eyes.  I looked around and told her, I am not sure what it is but look at all the dogs, they know exactly what it is.  There was a very large dog about 100 yards away over the ridge, that was frozen in place and staring in the direction of the sound.  There were 2 other dogs, one on a chain on the porch of a house and a hunting dog on a chain about 75 yards away from us.  Both of those dogs were frozen in place looking in the direction of the sound.  Not one of the dogs barked.  The hunting dog was the closest to the sound and it was still and quiet. <BR><BR>My girlfriend said what do we do now?  Before those words were finished coming out of her mouth, I was trying to make the same sound back at whatever it was but I only did one guttural call instead of 3.  She said oh my God Ernie. It was quiet for 5 -10 seconds after my call and then it responded with another single call like I had just done. I thought I heard something moving. When it responded, a rooster crowed right behind us and then the rooster and chickens with it ran off the hillside behind us.  My girlfriend wanted to leave and go to my grandfathers and that sounded like a good Idea, however; I wanted to see if I could get close enough to see what it was. I convinced her we were safe in the car. So we got on the gravel road that went up to the water tank farther up the mountain, very close to where the sound had come from.  On the way up we  passed the dogs, They were standing still and looking up the mountain. When we got to the water tank I wanted to get out but my girlfriend asked me not to.  I listened to her and frankly happy that I did, since I didn''t have anything for protection.  I had the windows down hoping to hear it again.  There was silence and then the dogs started barking at us.   That told me whatever had scared them must have been gone then, so we left.  The hunting dog that was standing still when we went passed it on the way up the hill was spinning around and flipping he was going so fast to try to get at our car. <BR>I didn''t see anything but heard much.   <BR>",

    " I had gotten up in the middle of the night to get a drink. After leaving the kitchen, I went to the backdoor to look out the window. There is a road about 100 yards from the back of my house with a dusk to dawn light that is still in the same location today. As I stood there I noticed something start up the bank toward the road from our field. It cleared the road in one stride. I can not give any clear physical dimensions because of the distance and being night, but because of the dusk to dawn light I could tell that it was not a man, it had wide shoulders and long arms, and was hairy. I stood there frozen for a moment, and kept looking to see if it would return. After a few moments, I went back to bed. But this does not end here. The next day I went next door to my great grandmother`s house to check on her. During our conversation, she looked at me and said, \"I started to call you last night\". \"What for\" was my response. \"Someone was standing outside my window around 3:00 AM\". When she said this the hair stood up on my neck. Before I could say anything else, she looked me square in the eye and said, \"He was big. He was as tall as the top of my window\". You need to understand, my great grandmother`s home was built in the late 1800`s, and had the old, four foot tall windows. I stand 6`-3\", and the top of the window (inside the house) was over my head. Outside, from ground level, this person would had to have been close to eight foot tall! I then proceeded outdoors, where I found a large section of grass had been flattened outside her window. There was only one footprint, and it was in the direction it would have been walking to the road. The print was approximately 18\" long, and about 8\" wide. I never told my great grandmother what I saw the night before, and to my knowledge, she never mentioned this to anyone else. This incident is as clear today as it was 28 years ago. I never heard any stories from anyone else in the area. I have kept trying to play this off as a hoax, but it just doesn''t make sense. Why would someone go to all that trouble to hoax a sighting for the possibility of being seen by one 88 year old woman?",

    " My girlfriend had come to town for the weekend, and we had gone up to the abandoned fire tower on Butt Mountain to go hiking and camping for the weekend.  We arrived there early on a Saturday morning, and set up our tent and did some exploring around the campsite, since it was her first time there.  I had been to this site camping earlier in the Spring with some other friends.  When we got back to the campsite, we found that a group of students from Va. Tech had arrived and had set up their tents on the other side of the clearing from us.  <BR><BR>We spent the afternoon exploring below the cliffs to the west of our campsite.  There were some openings in the cliff face there, and we had noticed that they were full of trash dumped from the campground area above.  We had seen quite a few deer in the area, but no signs of anything bigger.<BR><BR>Around 5 or 6 we came back to our tent and started to make something for dinner. We had brought some italian sausages and where cooking those on our camp stove. While my girlfriend was cooking, I was watching the now drunk college students goofing off below the cliffs around the opening I had mentioned before.  As I was watching them, I noticed some movement in the trees across the gap.  I just caught a glimpse of something dark moving down the hill thru the trees.  Thinking it was a bear, I moved further behind the bush beside me, so I could watch it without being seen. It seemed to take forever moving down the hill. I would keep thinking it had gone off in another direction, then  would see a dark patch in the break in the trees. Finally it walked into a larger break in the trees, and was walking on two legs.  Thats when I realized I was seeing a Bigfoot.  <BR><BR>It had not noticed me thru the bush in front of me, its attention seemed to be on the noisy college students below me on the cliff, and it was blocked from their view by the trees and bushes.  The creature seemed to be a dark brown color, but it was in the shade of the trees, so I could not be 100% certain of its color.  It was covered with long hair.  I could see hair maybe 4 or 5 inches long hanging from its left arm clearly.  The face area looked dark, but less hairly, kind of like a thin beard in places.  I was probably 100 to 125 yards away, but I would guess the height was around 6 and half feet by the height of the bush beside it. Its body was wide at the shoulders like a football player with shoulder pads on. The body was muscular but tapered in size from down towards the waist and hips. <BR><BR> As the creature was watching the campers, it squatted down and was moving side to side, like it was peeking thru openings in the bushes and trees trying to follow the action of the campers.  Several times, it seemed to raise its head as if to sniff the air.  I watched the creature watching the campers for probably 3 to 4 minutes, then it must have realized I was there, and it turned to look towards me.  When it turned, I could see it had no neck, and had to turn its entire upper body towards me.  As soon as it saw me, it froze for maybe 5 to 10 seconds. At this point I could see the eyes were very dark and large looking. The nose looked more flattened than a human nose, but not exactly like an ape. The face seemed egg shaped, with strong looking jaws. I could not see much detail in the mouth or lip area. <BR><BR>After this, the creature moved behind some bushes and was blocked from my view, so I moved out from behind the tree I was at, and moved forward some.  I was hoping to get another glimpse of it, but only managed to see patches of something dark thru breaks in the trees as it headed back up the hill on the other side.  <BR><BR>About this time, my girlfriend came up behind me and asked where the bear went.  She had only caught a glimpse of something dark and figure I was just watching a bear. She wanted to know if it might come back that night and bother us.  Since I didn''t want to scare her, I didn''t tell her that it wasn''t a bear until the next day after we had packed the car and headed down the mountain. I didn''t hear anything around the campsite that night, except the students camping nearby, and they were up most of the night partying.<BR><BR><BR>I guess I should tell you. Until I moved from Va. 3 years ago, I had spent most of my free time in the woods, camping or hiking. I grew up exploring the wilderness on my own and also with the boy scouts.  I have a Masters in Biology, and am well aware of what bear and all the other native animals to this area look like. <BR>",

    " I put off sharing this story publicly for some time. When the incident occurred, I was working in Law Enforcement at a Regional Jail in Virginia. Stories of Bigfoot always intrigued me, and because I read quite a bit about them, my fellow officers got a kick out of asking me questions about Bigfoot habits. A couple of friends who worked with me decided we should do a \"Bigfoot Hunt\", aka, a weekend camping trip.<BR><BR>We told other people we were heading out to find Bigfoot in jest, we were all really going to just get away from everything for a couple of days. We all met up and traveled into Giles County, Virginia into the Jefferson National Forest. This was not a new place for a couple of the guys in our group who camped, fished and hunted in the area most of their lives. In all, about 10 of us, most of us Law Enforcement Officers, wound up camping that weekend.<BR><BR>The first night was on a Friday Night. It was clear skies and crisp air, but no moon. Some of the group decided right before the sun set to take a hike through the woods. To the best of my recollection, we were only a short distance from the West Virginia Border, so the trail actually went up into the mountains around us, we were in what would best be described as a kind of horseshoe valley with mountains and very densely wooded area surrounding us.<BR><BR>It took them a couple of hours to make it back to camp and we all sat around the campfire talking and telling stories until about 11:00pm or so, and some of the guys who had worked that day went to bed. We had our tents set up around the clearing of the camping space we had, most of the tents fairly close to the campfire area. A few of us sat up around the fire and continued talking.<BR><BR>Around 12:30am or so, while we were talking we heard what I would describe as a vocalization on a ridge that I would estimate was about a mile or so from us. We all stopped talking and looked at each other. Within a few seconds, there was a second vocalization from another area that was to our left and had to have been another creature answering the first one. There were no more sounds, but it did make us all take a moment and try to figure out what it was. <BR><BR>A couple more guys went to bed and that left me and another gentleman who had came with a co-worker, sitting at the campfire. While we were talking, I kept hearing these \"Click\" sounds behind us. I realized it was small stones or pebbles being thrown and hitting the picnic table that was about 10 feet away. We took out our flashlights and shined them into the trees but saw nothing. <BR><BR>There was just an eerie feeling of being watched from that point on. Even though we could see nothing, I couldn''t shake that feeling. I decided to sleep in my car that night instead of my tent. It was such a black night outside that without light, you couldn''t see your hand in front of your face. Very dark night. A creature could have walked around the camp and we would have never seen it outside the campfire light.<BR><BR>The next morning, I would say about 30 minutes before the sun came up. It was light outside, but not quite day yet, after a very sleepless night, a few guys had come out of their tents and we met at the picnic table. I was telling the guys what had happened the night before, there was 4 of us at the table and another guy was building the campfire back up, we heard what I can only describe as talking. <BR><BR>It was loud enough that all of us heard it, and it came from the dense woods behind where we were standing. It sounded like a language I had never heard before, like a mix of something that sounded Russian or Eastern European and an Asian language of some kind mixed. The sound was about 3 to 5 seconds long, like it was saying a sentence and then it was silent. We were all pretty much shocked into silence as we looked at each other then at the woods. Keep in mind, almost all of us were cops, and many of us were armed, but none of us was going into the woods to see what had spoke.<BR><BR>I stayed for the day, still wondering what we had encountered the night before and that morning. I didn''t stay the second night. Some of the guys who had not been up when the incidents occurred gave those of us who had experienced the events a hard time in jest, but I wasn''t staying out there again.<BR><BR>Could we have been pranked? Possibly, but if anyone knew who we were and what we did for a living, that would have been a dangerous thing to do at night. I also don''t know anyone who would have been that far out in the middle of nowhere that would have stayed out there all night long just to mess with us. That just doesn''t make sense.",

    " It was late July 2007 and my wife and I had brought our newborn baby daughter home just a few days earlier. It was about 1 AM and I was in the living room of my house watching television after pulling 2nd shift at work. My wife and baby daughter were two rooms away sleeping. She had opened the bedroom window earlier to let a little cool air in. All of a sudden a scream came from that corner of the house that stood me right up off the couch. I ran to the bedroom to find my wife sitting up in the bed as wide eyed and shocked as me. When I finally gathered myself enough and went outside to investigate, I found nothing. We kind of forgot about it until watching Finding Bigfoot several years later. They played what they thought were howls of the creature recorded on tape. My wife and I looked at each other and totally agree that whatever made the howls on the program is exactly what we heard that night. It''s a sound you never forget.",

    " Hi,<BR>    I am relaying this story for my brother since I have access to the net and he does not, but I will relate the story to you just as he told it to me with his permission. <BR><BR>My name is [PB], I am 35 years old and live in Salem, VA in Roanoke County. My brother [RB] who actually had the sighting on April 4 of this year is 8 years younger.  <BR><BR>I have several rental properties in this area and my brother is my repair person/handy man.  One particular rental property is vacant and it happens to be directly in front of the house that I live in now.  On Thursday April 4, 2002, my brother was painting the interior of this house.  I work 2nd shift and usually get home around 11:30 each night.  At 11:30 I noticed that my brother was still working on the house so I stopped to see how things were going.  He was visibly shaken so I asked him if anything was wrong.  He then told me that at aprox. 10:45pm that night, he took a break and went out to the front yard to smoke a cigarette.  He heard a dog barking back in the woods, about a 100 yards away.  A short time later my dog became extremely agitated, barking and growling.  He was startled because he had never known my dog to behave in this manner.  He then heard something large \"crashing\" through the trees, and what he saw, he just couldn''t beleive.  He said he saw a \"very large creature\" traveling at a high rate of speed and making a very loud \"gutteral grunting noise\" running much faster than a human could possibly run.  He said he got a very good look at it before it crossed the road and went out of sight. It''s arms were swinging down by it''s sides.  He said it was very broad and very tall but he could not tell me just how tall it was.  He said that it was very hairy, and described the hair as \"long and curly like a sheepdog\".  He said that it appeared to be a silver-gray color.  (All the reports of bigfoot sightings I have ever read however seem to say that they are brown or black in color).<BR> <BR>    My brother said that he would be glad to speak to anyone who might be interested in hearing his story first hand.  This is also not the first sighting in this area that I have heard about.  I also have a good friend who tells me that he saw a \"Bigfoot\" while out scouting for deer in Ironto VA. in Montgomery county.  Acording to my GPS, it is 9 miles from here as the crow flies.  <BR><BR>I can honestly say that I absolutely beleive my brother''s story and my friend''s as well.  Thank you very much for the great work and I look forward to hearing from you,<BR>Sincerely,<BR>[PB]<BR><BR>",

    " It was last year (2019) around mid October near the Blue Ridge Parkway. Me and my boyfriend were working for the Roanoke Times delivering newspapers when this encounter happened.  We delivered anywhere from 12am-6am. We were almost done with the route when we went to turn down this dead end maintenance road since there was houses at the end of that who got the paper.  It was around 3:30-4am. While My boyfriend was going down the gravel end maintenance road the headlights caught a glimpse of this thing standing right at where the grass met the road. It stood about 7ft tall and it took off up the hill. It kinda walked fast, not necessarily ran. It was dark brown and had shaggy hair like fur. It was on 2 feet and walked like a human with its arms swaying back in forth right below the knees. <BR><BR>I screamed out for my boyfriend to stop the car, but by time his reaction time kicked in whatever it was had already made it''s way up the hill. My boyfriend positioned the car so the lights would shine up that hill and that''s when we saw 2 bright glowing red/yellow eyes looking back at us. What was strange was it was hiding behind a huge tree and how high the eyes was up from the ground was close to 7ft tall. You could clearly see the eyes blink. We sat there for approximately 10 minutes and finally decided to finish up the route and come back. We did eventually come back after we got done with the last house and it was gone, but you could see where tree limbs and grass was pushed down from where it was standing on the side of the road.<BR><BR>Maybe less then a month before we had that encounter we had heard tree knocks while on our route, from deep down in the woods maybe a neighborhood or two over. It scared us so bad when we heard it that we just bagged the newspaper up and threw it on the side of the road.",

    " I was ridding my atv on the family farm going down an old washed out road which you cant drive fast on. As I started down the road looking down at the road then looking up down the road something caught my eye about 150 to 200 yards down this road. The sun was to my left shining across this road to the right as I looked down this narrow road there was a reflection of the light coming off the fur of something that I never had seen before,it was tall and massive. For that split second I saw it. The way the suns reflection came off of this thing it look almost silver. But being a hunter (I hunt this land all the time) There isnt anything silver in color. And that the sun coming off the back of a black turkey can look silver. So thats what caught my eye. This animal went back in to the woods back to the right. I worked my way down to where I thought I saw it. I turned my atv off and smoked a cig. Listing for any thing and about 5 min. had past and I heard something big running away from my direction breaking big tree limbs. (It was way louder than a deer running through the thickets). I could hear this for about 1 to 2 seconds and then it went quiet again. If I had to guess how far away it was I would say about 50 to 60 yards away from me when I first heard the running. (You cant see more than 20 yards in to this thickets from where I was at. (Hunting season end for general firearms 10 days before this so the deer are still alert.) Then it seemed like a couple of min. later I heard two big bangs like someone hitting a stick against a tree or log then the hair on the back of my neck stood up.Then there was the snorting of the deer that came from the thicket right after that. (When a deer snorts from my experience in the woods during the day they see you and snort once or twice and then they take off leaving you just to see there white tail waving at you as they go out of sight.) But there must have been 4 or 5 white tail in there all of them snorting and stomping the ground and they were real loud.The deer did this for about what seamed to be more than a min.then I heard them take off running. And thats when I decided it was time for me to leave too.I went home and told my wife about what had just happened and she couldnt believe it and was surprised at what I told her and ask if it was bear? I told her I never saw a beer in the woods and it seamed way to big to be a black bear.So the next day (Wednesday the 22nd) I wasnt going to GO BACK THAT DAY.I took a camera in where I heard this animal and took pictures of what I believe to be footprints and some hair that was left on a tree limb about 5 1/2 feet off the ground",

    " I am an avid runner. I run close to 50 miles a week every week. I often run the exact same route. When I trail run I have been followed by deer and other wildlife that comes up from time to time. However, today was different. First I was not on a trail but on a country road near my house. I crossed a main road and was headed out to my turn around point. There is a thick wooded area on the right hand of the road. I heard something in the woods and thought maybe it was a deer or a dog. I kept running but the noise kept happening. It was like someone was in the woods just out of sight running in the leaves as I was running on the road. I would slow down and it would slow down. I would speed up and it would speed up. When I passed a house the noise would stop for a few yards and then pick back up again in the wooded areas. I am an avid hunter. This really sounded like a person or something like a person running along in the woods as I ran the road. Thing is the wooded side of the road is very up and down with several deep drop offs. So whatever was keeping pace with me was able to navigate them with no problem at all. I run a 9 minute mile pace. So whatever was following me in the woods had to keep that pace yet in the woods and the deep valley areas. Maybe I was hearing things. However, there was a recent sighting in our area and I thought I would at least report this to you guys. No visual on what was there. I will keep a better eye out into the woods now if I hear it again though.",

    " At around 11pm on July 26th my wife and I we''re night fishing on the backwater of cranesnest river in Dickinson county Virginia. My wife''s head was hurting so she decided to take a nap we had heard something large walking in the woods but wrote it off as a bear or deer as both are plentiful in our area. She had been asleep for about an hour when I heard a large knock about 50 yards up in the tree line then about 15 to 20 seconds later several hundred yards up the ridge there was another knock. Both sounded as if someone had taken a 4x4 post and struck a tree with it. Then about 10 min later there was a splash in the water about 20 feet away from our boat. This splash sounded like something weighing 20 or 30 lbs had struck the water waking my wife. It''s not unusual to hear large fish jumping at night but this was different after the splash no more than a couple minutes had passed and there was 2 more knocks. And they were closer than the first one. <BR><BR>We pulled anchor reeled in our lines and as we were leaving we heard 2 more knocks. My wife said she heard the knocks up on the ridge but I didn''t hear those, just the sound of a large animal walking up the river same way we were traveling as if it was following us. When it came to a shallow cove where it would have had to swim we stopped hearing the walking sounds.<BR><BR>This is the second time we encountered this animal we had an experience about a month and a half earlier we heard a big animal walking around and had big splashes in the water as if it were throwing things at us on that night as well.<BR>",

    " My husband and I where sitting on the front porch one evening when what I thought was a bear caught my attention on the edge of the tree line. I told my husband to look at the bear and he stated that was not a bear because it was to large. We continued watching for approximately two minutes when a deer darted out from the tree line. The dark mass I thought was a bear then stood up and chased the deer into the woods. My husband and I looked at each other in disbelief at what we had just saw. It was too far away to get great detail of the animal but close enough to tell that it was very large and dark brown / black in color. After seeing it chase the deer on two legs back into the forest, I knew instantly that no bear could have ran so fast and so graceful on two legs.  The next evening my husband went to the same spot in the tree line while I stayed on the porch so we could compare the sizes between the animal and him. My husband is 5 foot 10 and what ever we saw was at least 1 and 1/2 - 2 feet taller than he was. ",

    " At approximately 10 pm one night, my wife and I returned home from a shopping trip. Upon opening the car door and stepping into the gravel driveway I heard a distinct and loud vocalization. It wasn''t a howl, not a growl, nothing I had heard before which is what caught my attention. At 31 years old now, 28 then, I had spent my life in the outdoors, locally and abroad.<BR><BR>I have never heard anything to match this. My wife asked me what it was and I had to admit I didn''t know, but perhaps it was a big cat. But it didn''t sound like a cat, and the only cats in the area that are known as ''big'' would be bobcats, a big one being 18-29 lbs.<BR><BR>I walked inside the house, cutting on the rear porch light, and walked through the house to the front deck where I walked back outside, cutting on the front deck light. I stood at the end of the deck facing east and listened intently.<BR><BR>The ''cries'' were coming from a ridge in a large woodlot across the railroad tracks behind our house. Our house is situated on 10 acres, and the rear property boundary is the railroad. At that time the nearest house to us, a couple of hundred yards to the east was uninhabited, but the next houses up and across the railroad tracks were. <BR><BR>Between cries, I realized I could hear leaves rustling loudly as though two feet were shuffling through them in large strides. When the leaves stopped making noise, an agitated cry was heard. This went on for a minute or two, then the noises came from closer to the neighboring houses, then it started going in the other direction. I probably listened for ten minutes total, until could no longer hear the leaves moving, and howls were coming from farther away.<BR>It was mid fall and cold, the sky was clear, no traffic on the road in front of my house which intersects with the railroad maybe a quarter mile down the road.  <BR><BR>I have labored under the impression that the cries came from some kind of cat, but after listening to the Ohio recording, the cries I heard were frightfully akin to the howls on that recording. They were shorter and sounded more agitated as though something was making the ''issuer'' of the cries mad. The large woodlot across the tracks is semi-surrounded by a loose assortment of houses in a neighborhood, which could be easily walked through unseen in the dark. Everything else for surrounding areas is farm pasture and mountain, in fact one mile from my house to the east starts a gravel road running across a mountain into the next county.<BR><BR>My inside dogs were whining and agitated, but never offered to bark, then, they rarely do. However neighborhood dogs could be heard barking in the distance, beagles I know for sure and a German Shepherd.<BR>",

    " Not certain of the exact date of this occurrence, but I was lying in bed awake about 3am and was startled by what sounded like something pushing up against and rattling the vinyl siding on our house. This woke Lisa my wife up. I went outside with a flashlight but didn''t see anything. We didn''t think much of this at the time. Then we had two other occurrences within a two week time span. On Friday, November 16, around 6:15pm my wife and myself were almost home from our daily walk and while at the intersection of Northridge and Old Saltworks Rd., approximately 200 yards from our house we both heard and were surprised by a very loud, deep, guttural sound that was something between a growl and a roar. It only lasted for a couple of seconds. It was very voluminous and powerful. We just stopped and asked each other what on earth did we just hear. Then the incident that was the icing on the cake that made us come to this website and file this report, occurred on Friday, November 23 around 9pm. I shined a light behind our house to see if there were any deer out feeding. About 160 yards from our deck in a small patch of woods behind our house I saw two, large, brilliant, emerald green eyes, which were the shape of human eyes, but were about 7-8 inches apart. This freaked me out. I am an experienced outdoors-man and have logged several hundred days afield over the past 35 years. I have walked for hours by flashlight to get to hunting stands and have never ever seen eyes this shape and of this brilliance and set this far apart before. Before these occurrences I was very skeptical of all the Bigfoot stories and sightings I have seen or read about, but now I am open to the possibility that there is something out there that could fit the description of a Bigfoot. What we heard was very unique, and combined with the eye shine I saw, has changed my mind and opened me up to the possibility of a Sasquatch type creature lurking in the shadows. This is very exciting! ",

This area is frequented by large amounts of hunters during the fall which should have made the deer stay very far away. We also had a large campfire.

    " A friend and I were in the woods just after night fall in the fall back in 1976. It was an old abandoned road the city never paved and it was grown over very badly. It had been used as a party spot for teens for many years. I was against being there but my friend wanted to pick up beer cans for the money. You remember back when everyone was doing that. Any way as we walked down I was shining the light from side to side looking for anything or anyone that might be down there with us. You see, for about two years straight , we had had run ins with this thing on several occasions. All our parents told us we were crazy, it was probably someone in a suit trying to scare us. We know the difference in a suit and a real creature. Well, as I shined the light to the left and came back across the road, this thing took one step to it`s left and was out in the middle of the trail. That was about 6 feet in one step. The s.o.b. was right in front of my light, about 10 feet away. I had never been that close to it before. I was absolutely terrified and yelled at my buddy and turned and started running my you know what off. It wasn`t really that tall, maybe between 6 and 7 feet. It just stood there for the couple seconds I looked at it. It never made a move towards us. Just stood there and looked.I actually only saw it for a couple seconds but it was about 4 feet wide at the shoulder and dark colored.

    " Since this happened 4 years ago you can tell I''ve been somewhat haunted by it. How I came to believe what I saw was Gigantopethicus or something very like it took time to develop and just tonight (June 26, 2007) after reading the news item about the expedition to the UP of Michigan, finding your site and then seeing Bill Munns model of Giganto on http://www.uiowa.edu/~bioanth/giganto.html<BR>I''m convinced I saw something out of the ordinary.<BR><BR>After driving in from our home in NY my daughter and I were staying in a cabin for a few days at the Staunton River State Park, VA with a friend of hers from VA. On the night in question I had to drive to Danville to pick up and bring back another daughter who was coming up from Greensboro to stay with us for the weekend. Her bus didn''t pull in to Danville until around 11PM so I left the park around 9PM. It was a dark, rainy drive with some patchy but not heavy fog.<BR><BR>Because of the conditions and my unfamiliarity with the road I concentrated more on driving than noticing much of the surroundings. At some point around 1/2 way I was coming around a wide bend to the left when my headlights fell upon a broadside view of what I first thought was a huge dog, just off the road moving from left to right. It simply turned it head to look at the lights and lumbered slowly but deliberately towards the treeline. It was then I realized it was no dog. Maybe a lion? It had huge eyes like a lion as well as a mane. But it wasn''t shaped like a lion, it was big in the front, big head, big shoulders and chest but more streamlined to the rear. Walking on all fours but not like a dog or big cat. The front legs seemed taller than the rear. If you remember the monster in the scifi movie ''Forbidden Planet'' you''ll have pretty good idea of it''s shape, not of course as exaggerated as that but similar. It did not appear startled or afraid, it simply walked in towards the trees while watching my car drive past.<BR><BR>Since then I had no idea what it could have been until I read something about Gigantopethicus and saw a pic of a statue of it on all fours on a website. That statue I thought was close but no cigar. Then tonight I found the Bill Munns picture with the model in color and it clicked. It was very much the same coloring, mane, head and eyes. The only difference was the size, what I saw was huge, on all fours maybe almost the size of a Volkswagen Beetle but if it stood up not quite so tall...but then again the sighting was only seconds before I had to return my attention to navigating the rest of the turn at maybe 40 miles per hour. <BR> ",

    " I live in Tazewell VA. Last Friday on June 20, 2014 me and my son was cutting hay on my dad''s farm in Thompson Valley near Route 16. It was close to 3pm and the sun was mostly out. I was cutting hay way ahead of my son, the field is half surrounded by woods and near the Clinch Mountains. I had made a pass by the corner of the field on a hill side and my mowing cutter is heavy so it slid down the hill while cutting, and left a strip of grass about 60 foot long before I seen it. So I raised the cutter and turned my head to back up and re-cut and out of the corner of my eye something caught my attention. I turned my head a little more and I saw something real dark or black and tall and slim with long legs running on an angle away and down the hill real fast . Now the beast was not on our side of the property and the slim patch of woods where I seen it was only about 4 ft. wide. The sun was bright so I saw it for the 3 to 5 seconds real fine! Below where it ran and beside one the upper ends of the property are thicker woods! At first it did not dawn on me what I just had seen because we were trying to get the hay cut before it got too late. But as I was going on and thought about why was a man there and ran off when I stopped the tractor to back up! Then it dawned on me it was to tall and it was blackish in color, and the 3 steps I plainly saw it make was the distance between 3 fence post. We put our fence post around 10 feet apart so that would make it about 25 to 30 feet in length in 3 STEPS! I then knew what I saw was human shape but too big for a human and if it was someone I would have saw colors for the pant and shirt, there was no colors just dark. I forgot to mention the bigfoot I saw was around 100 yards away so the first time I passed it not seeing it, and when I stopped to back up with the tractor It must have thought I saw it and that''s when it ran off I guess? I stopped to tell my 17 year-old son what I saw, he is 6ft 2 and slender. He crossed the fence where I saw it and stood there till I walked to the place I had seen it and I knew it was much taller than him! We found no hair or foot prints just cow and horse. And one horse hair. I am a christian man.  would not lie and tell this occurrence of my life if it was not so. That image is burnt in my mind till the day I die! I would have to say it was around 7 foot tall! And fast!",

    " On a hot summer evening between July-August 2006, I had the window of the bedroom open. I heard \"very close\" moaning or howling from our open bedroom window of our home around 3:45 in the morning. The howling and noise woke me from a sound sleep. I could not get my husband awake who was sound asleep at this time, I tried quietly. The howling or moaning at first sounded like that of another type of animal in pain (more like a large pig or cow at first) but changed to sound like something \"very large\" in size and getting very upset (VERY deep, angry tone growls). <BR><BR>I did some research before contacting you and I have heard what bear sound like on various recordings. As well as, other type of animal recordings. This animal in no way sounded like that of a bear or anything else I have heard in the past. Finding your web site and listening to the recordings of moaning and such brought chills up my back!!! They sound so familiar to that night but I still cannot be certain. We have a small spaniel mix dog that sleeps in our basement garage area located under our home. Upon hearing the howling outside that night, the dog moved to the garage door area located directly under the bedroom window and barked like being startled from sleep three times. I could tell, the creature I had heard moaning and howling moved to the garage door under our open bedroom window (which is two stories high) and growled \"very deep\" at our barking dog while \"striking or smacking\" above the garage door. The dog STOPPED barking! Then I heard nothing out of our dog or from the animal outside the window again that night. <BR><BR>I was too frightened to move and look outside. For a long time prior to this I had a strange unexplained feeling of \"being watched\" while being outside on our homes patio. This patio faces pretty dense wooded area on three angles back there. Something just made me feel uncomfortable even in daylight hours out there that I had not felt before since moving here. Although a bit odd, I no longer have this same feeling. <BR><BR>On two different nights prior, I couldn''t sleep and heard what sounded like small rocks hitting the brick outside of our home close to our bedroom area. I assumed it was just the home settling while the temperature was cooling down in the late evenings. We live in a pretty dark (not much light in this area at all) heavily wooded and somewhat quiet area just outside of town. We have several deer, turkey, rabbits, squirrel and other small game that roam throughout our woods and property.  ",

    " I live in a very rural area of McDowell Co. West Virginia. It is not unusual to see bear, coyote, deer, etc. on a weekly basis around my home. I am an avid hunter/outdoorsman, and I have seen and heard (up to this incident) everything the woods of West Virginia have to offer. <BR><BR>On July 23, 2009 I was setting on my front porch area of my residence (I had built a fire) at approx. 11:30p.m when I heard a loud \"scream\" from 150-200 yards away. My dogs immediately began barking in the direction of the noise. I assumed it was a mountain lion. I listened intently for a few more minutes but I heard nothing else. After about fifteen/twenty minutes, I heard something walking through the wood line directly across the road from my house. <BR><BR>The crashing brush led me to believe that it was a large animal, possibly a bear. At exactly 12:15 a.m (fifteen minutes after midnight) I heard a loud roar or moan come from across the road from my house, approximately 300 yards from my house. The animal then proceeded to moan again, however this time, I also heard a growl. After the second moan, I then heard what I can only describe as a series of moaning howls. <BR><BR>The howls sent a cold chill up my spine. I am avid hunter, and I know that the animal responsible for these noises had to be extremely large, at least 800-1000 lbs. I went inside and locked my doors. I am confident it was not a coyote, bear, mountain lion, cow, etc. This animal had a distinct, powerful moan that could never have been made by any of these animals.<BR>",

We had thought we saw someone else that was hunting coming our way from the direction we couldn''t be seen but the closer it got the more unusual it got. <BR><BR>It was walking about 50 yards below us and when we finally got a good look at it we could see it was a bigfoot. It was about 8-10 feet tall, fur from head to toe, and was extremely thick and muscular. We watched in amazement as it walked for about 100 yards until it was out of sight. <BR><BR>We told all our friends about it and got interest from them as well. We went back the next weekend with 6 of us in total at about the same time we saw it. We went to the same path it was travelling and kept hearing something in the distance on the same path ahead of us so we decided to try and track it in two separate groups. On the path we found 2 separate footprints that were human like but huge. We also kept hearing something ahead of us the entire time. We got to the top of the mountain ridge when the sun was starting to set and while we were talking all 6 of us saw the bigfoot heading down the other side of the ridge. <BR><BR>",

    " My wife and I were taking an evening drive on Highland Scenic Highway 150, from US 219 near Slatyfork, WV, to the Cranberry Glades area on Tuesday evening 9/6/16.  We had been stopping at the scenic overlooks taking pictures, and had just left the Williams River overlook, and headed south on 150.  There was a stretch of highway that was very straight and a downslope of about 4-6% about 1-2 miles south of the Williams River overlook.  As we were driving down, we both noticed something in the weeds between the road edge and the bank leading up to the woods on the west side.  At first I thought it was a deer, with its head and neck stretched up above the weeds.  It was about 300-400 feet ahead, and while we continued towards it, it spun around, similar to an about face, but with the head dropping and a semi-crouch as it was turning.  It jumped up onto the bank, reaching for a branch to aid in pulling itself up.  By the time it jumped, we were within 80-100 feet of it.  By the time we got to where it had been standing, it was nowhere in sight, and we could hear no sounds of running or branches breaking in the piney woods along the road.  We both noticed that the weeds at this point and all along the area, were even with the hood on the 3/4 ton Chevy pickup we were in, making the estimate on the height of the creature at about 7-7 1/2 ft tall.  The creature was a mix of brown, and brown gold fur, longer than deer hair, but not as long as collie fur.  I have never discounted that Sasquatch could be real, but this firsthand experience has removed my doubt.  As we left the area, my arms and neck were covered in goose-flesh, and we were both speechless for about 10 minutes.",

    "We have talked to many locals in the area. Most people keep to themselves in these parts. I can understand this.One lady we met did not know our story and we asked her if she had ever seen anything strange in the area. She said that she would walk her dogs around the same lake in the mornings after her husband went to work. Both dogs are large and not afraid of anyone. As they walked near the picnic area she noticed a figure at the edge of the woods. It was summertime and the figure was covered from head to toe in dark fur. She knew then that it was not human. Both of her dogs were terrified and would not bark, and they tried to hide behind her. She backed away and it disappeared into the woods. Since then she will not go back. Another incident was told to me by my parents, who were skeptical about my stories. They were camping last Fall and there was only one other man camping there. They jokingly asked him if he had seen any bigfoots lately? He got quiet for a moment and told them that a few nights before he had been camping outside the campground in a roadside spot. He had a small dog with him. Just before midnight he turned off his lantern and was going to bed. His dog had a certain bark for people he knew and one for strangers. The man told my dad that the dog almost ripped the blinds off of the camper and was barking frantically at something outside the camper. He knew something was wrong so he grabbed his pistol. When he went to the door, he saw a very large black shadow walk between the fire and the camper. This made his hair stand on end. He left the next day. I would love to go and spend more time in the area and show someone what I believe are hotspots. After the first sightings I have been convinced \"THEY DO EXIST!!!\"",

    "Yes... after this I have been very curious as to what this could be. I have spent a lot of time camping in all seasons including winter here. While free-diving I found numerous large tracks crossing shallow areas of the lake in water up to 8 feet deep. Most recently in the winter of 2005 my wife and I camped for 1 month in this area looking for clues. In late December we went back for a few days in the snow when there was no one else around, this time however I think it found us! All that night we heard loud knocking in several locations, one not far from our tent. It was almost as if they were signaling each other from across the lake. This was so loud I believe you could hear it for miles. My 3 dogs were extremely frightened and very quiet. Normally they would be barking.",

    " Many years ago while camping in Monongahela National Forest in the fall with my family, my son and I decided to walk around part of the lake at night time. It was a beautiful bright night. the temperature was in the 50''s. We came upon a marshy area just off of the trail. <BR><BR>There was a meadow at the edge of the lake. We heard a loud commotion, and sticks breaking. We stopped to look thinking that it may have been campers looking for firewood. I saw two very large black upright creatures ripping branches and bark from the trees. It appeared that they were eating the bark. <BR><BR>My son and I were about 125 feet away at the most. I was so scared and in disbelief, I quietly told my son (he was 10), to move slowly down to the ground. We crouched behind a rock and watched over 15 minutes. I have never sweat like this in my entire life, I was so frightened. <BR><BR>The smallest of the two had a arm reach about 10 to 12 feet. The larger of the two was several feet higher. All of a sudden, the two stepped back into the darkness of the woods and a third one stepped out. This one was unbelievably tall. We only watched a few more seconds and I told my son \"We have to run\". <BR><BR>We ran nonstop back to my family''s camper. My dad did not believe us. He thought it was a bear. I told him that there was no way it was a bear. Even a grizzly was not as tall as the smallest ones arm reach. I grew up in the area and I spent alot of time in the woods and it takes alot to frighten me! <BR><BR>The next day I went to the same spot and found several feet of tree branches and smaller limbs at the base of several trees. The trees had been stripped of branches and bark. Through the years I stopped talking about it because I felt like no one believed me or my son.",

    " It was the summer of 1983 or 84 and I was working for a company during the summer months trying to pay my way through college.  I worked 58 hours a week so I had little time to do anything else besides work.  I had purchased a tent and decided to go camping one Saturday night (it was in August as best I can remember).  Because of the hours I worked, this was the only night I could go camping (I also went to church on Sundays but I had plenty of time to get up and make it to church  service did not start until 10:00 AM).<BR><BR>After arriving home from work on the Saturday (date not known exactly) I planned to go camping on, I packed my backpack with all the necessary items for the short stay including my new tent.  I left the house and hiked the mile or so to the area where I planned to camp.  Also, my dog accompanied me.  He was a fairly large collie dog weighing about 80 pounds.  This dog was very intelligent and to my knowledge was not afraid of any animal (this is an important fact to this incident).  I had never seen him back down from a fight.    <BR><BR>The area was forest (a mix of pine and eastern hardwoods) and consisted of 1,050 acres.  I knew this area well because I had hunted it for approximately 4 years.  I also hunted a farm directly adjacent to this property which consisted of 450 acres.  This area is surrounded by old farmland as well as other stretches of forested land.  I made camp on top of a ridge that was relatively flat for the area.<BR><BR>After setting up my tent and camp, I made a fire pit (It was the dry months and I did not want to start a forest fire) and started a small fire to cook on. At approximately 9:30 PM I turned in for the night.  At around 10:00 PM I was awakened by an animal call I had never heard before.  I can only describe the sound by saying it was big and had the lung capacity of a lion or an elephant.  It literally shook the forest and my chest.  <BR><BR>I have pretty much heard everything there is to hear in the eastern forests (life long hunter and geologist  I have literally spent years in the woods) and this was so completely different there was nothing at the time I could compare it to (recently, I heard the male gorilla recording that was posted on the BFRO web site and it sounded eerily similar).  <BR><BR>At first I was unsure of what I heard because I was half asleep.  The first time I heard the call it came from about 20 yards off to my left.  15 seconds later I heard the same thing directly behind my tent still about 20 yards off.  By this time I am setting up putting on my pants and boots.  Again, about 15 seconds later, I heard the same call off to the right of my tent about 20 yards off.  My hair was literally standing on end.  At this point, I was somewhat concerned that I was not hearing my dog bark or growl.  He was sleeping outside the tent and appeared to have left.  I grab an eight inch hunting knife and a wimpy flashlight I had with me.  When I pulled the tent flap back to shine the flashlight on whatever was making the noise, I noticed my dog backing up with his tail between his legs, the hair on the nape of his neck sticking straight up growling just barely audible.  <BR><BR>He could see what was making the noise but I was unable to make out any thing besides trees with the flashlight I had.  Whatever was out there, the dog kept his eyes on it.  I believed to this day that dog would have protected me to the death.  As I have already stated the hair on my body was standing on end and I was extremely afraid (I am 6 1,  220 lbs and dont scare too easily).  I believe whatever was making the sound was doing so in a threatening manner.<BR><BR>I left all my gear and only took the knife and flashlight for protection as I hiked the mile back out of the woods.  My dog constantly looked back.  He walked beside me the whole way out and would not leave my side.  I had to cross a couple of fields and I never saw anything following us but there were also stands of trees that ran beside the fields in the direction my dog was looking.<BR><BR>After church the next day, I went back and got all my gear and it was exactly like I had left it.  There was also food that was left untouched.  I scouted the area for tracks but found none.  As already stated, I was in thick woods and there was a heavy covering of leaves and such.<BR>",

I saw this large creature moving about the tombstones as if to be pacing back and fourth. It would stop sometimes as if to dig at a grave. It was very large, dark hairy appearance, ape like movements, shrugging of the shoulders and sometimes a hop to its step. It finally saw me and seemed to get upset when it started its shoulder movements and hopping motions, and it seemed to start toward me as if to run me away.<BR>It worked!  ",

    " It was back in probably the early 1970''s, Spring time, late at night (around midnight).  I was out riding down this road that had a farm on one side and an apple orchard on the other.  As I was driving there was some movement about two hundred yards in front of me going across the roadway from the farm to the orchard.  When the object got to the middle of the road it turned its head and looked in my direction, at this time I got a real good look at it, about 8 to 9 feet tall very heavy build, long lanky arms, long dark red hair, very long stride (about two and a half steps to cross road).  If I was to guess his weight, it would have been around 4 to 5 hundred pounds.  I was on a road with very little traffic (I was the only vehicle on the road at that time).  I got to admit, I was not a bigfoot believer until that night.  I didn''t tell anyone about this because I knew they would not believe me.  I was one of the chief officers in our local fire department at the time and I didn''t want people to think I was nuts.  Oh by the way, I did get close enough to see what it was or wasn''t.

The most recent sighting was 10-8-2006 and I''m telling you it was 7\"2 and huge, with big yellow eyes. It was watching my husband put our puppies in the fenced in dog pen. I just grabbed my 3 year old son and slowly walked to the porch. My husband didn''t even know at that time that he was being watched. Later on that night he seen something very big and he heard it walking closer to him.... He ran inside and we locked the door. He advised to me that it was no bear that could stand that tall, walk on hind legs!<BR><BR>The time we had seen 3 of them was at the beginning of September. I left rotten chicken outside and from the look of the leftovers it couldn''t be a small animal. The next morning about 5:00am we heard something big walking on the porch. then we heard the van door slam. My husband loaded the gun. We looked out the window, very quietly opened the front door. we heard a yelling noise and footsteps. There up in the woods across the road was 2 of them. they we''re standing side by side. one looked young and scared and hid behind a tree but the older one looked viscous and not afraid. He stood out in the open. my husband did fire a shot in the air to scare it away, which worked because  they ran.<BR><BR><BR>",

    "     In the fall of about 1960, while coon hunting with my grandfather and friend named Bill, we had an encounter with what I am now convinced was a Bigfoot. We had left our house, which sat atop a ridge and went down into our hollow.  We had planned to go down the creek about a mile to the next hollow, turn right up this hollow, follow it all the way up, and climb the hill back to the top of the ridge. We would then have an easy walk home on a gravel road, which was the main road in the area at that time. We were about three miles from the nearest blacktop road, which was WV RT2 running beside the Ohio River.<BR>    All was normal down the first hollow, but when we started up the second, the dogs returned in an agitated state, and began to growl and raise the hair on their backs. They refused to go up the hollow in the lead as they normally hunted.  Instead, they stayed close to the light, which was a kerosene lantern that lit a circle only a few feet wide. We also had a two-cell light, used sparingly to conserve batteries, and a six-volt spotlight, which turned out to have a dead battery.<BR>     No amount of encouragement from my grandpa could get the dogs to go do the job they had always done so well.  Another hundred yards or so up the hollow, they were even more nervous and sniffed the air with long, deep breaths. They stared intently into the darkness in the direction we were moving, and would not get more than a few yards away, all the while growling, acting in a way we had not seen before. Their actions were really beginning to annoy Grandpa and he was trying to let them know his feeling with a verbal assault on them, their ancestors, and their species in general, but they were unfazed and were staying just out of range of the toe of his boot. We were walking single file through briars and brush with Grandpa in the lead, and then me, with Bill bringing up the rear.\t\t<BR>    When we reached the point where the terrain started getting steep, somewhere from eighty to one hundred yards straight ahead, there came the most bloodcurdling sound I have ever heard. After another forty or so years of life this sound is still very clear in my mind. It began as a deep bellowing roar that went higher in frequency and ended with a very high AHH EEE EEE EEE as best I can describe it. It lasted six to seven seconds. The hardest thing is to try to describe the volume other than to say it could have been heard for miles, and I know of no known animal anywhere that can howl, yell, scream, roar, or trumpet that loud. Whatever made this sound had to be huge. It seemed as if my hair stood up and I had a bitter taste in my mouth, I suppose from adrenalin.<BR>     We froze in our tracks for a few seconds then instinct or reflex made me turn to run, but Bill was blocking the path. Grandpa, who was hard of hearing, turned and said, &#8220;What the hell was that?&#8221; He was born less than a mile from this exact spot and had spent his life hunting, trapping, and just walking these hills. He was the best woodsman I ever knew, so if he didn&#8217;t know what it was, I sure as hell didn&#8217;t know. It would be several more years before any of us ever heard of Bigfoot. Bill also was a true woodsman, who had gotten game and herbs from these hills all his life. I was about fourteen and had been hunting with these men since I could walk well enough to follow them.<BR>     By now all the dogs except one were nearly under our feet, making it difficult to walk. We were hunting with four mature plot hounds, weighing about seventy or eighty pounds each. Also along was a half grown pup, having fun and learning his trade. He was also the one that showed no fear, and took off in the direction of the scream. A plot hound is a large breed used in our area mostly for coon and groundhog hunting, but is also used for bear, boar, and mountain lion as well. Plots are usually known as a bold and totally fearless breed, but not this night. The dogs were a sorry sight, cowering beside us with their tails now tucked, except for the pup, who was now going full bore to investigate the scream.<BR>    We stood there and just listened for quite a while. There was only silence, except for the pup trotting up the hill. The leaves were very dry and we would have heard anything move, as we could now hear the pup moving towards the source of the sound.<BR>     Grandpa and Bill now started talking about what to do next. Just seeing these big dogs this scared made me want to go back the way we came, but the men I was with were not used to backing up, and this time would be no exception. The sound had come from directly in our path, and after ten minutes or so we started on up the hollow, my vote hadn&#8217;t counted. Grandpa had now adjusted our course a few degrees to the left, which would take us to the top of the ridge, but on the other side of the gully. This would be a steeper climb, but would allow us to pass while staying several yards away from this animal. I always thought Grandpa led us on up the hollow so he wouldn&#8217;t look scared, but adjusted course a bit, because he wasn&#8217;t stupid, and had no desire to have a face to face encounter with what ever this thing was with a single shot 22 rifle and a pack of scared dogs as our only defense. I still had a lot of boy in me and could be as scared as I damned well pleased, and I wanted out of there real bad.<BR>    As we climbed the hill, we would stop occasionally and listen and could plainly here the pup in the dry leaves and knew he was getting near the source of the sound.  When we were nearly at the same level on the hill as this animal and maybe fifty yards away, we heard a deep-throated growl that lasted about five seconds. Shortly afterwards the pup returned, wagging tail as if he had had a great time. This growl was so low in frequency that it might better be described as a rumble, and was very similar to the low frequency sounds elephants use to communicate. I have since wondered if Bigfoot families could use this form of long distance communications. If they did, we probably wouldn&#8217;t be able to hear them very far. Had this growl been any lower in frequency, I don&#8217;t think a human could have heard it at all. <BR>    When we got to the top of the ridge and therefore out of the hollow, there was another scream that lasted about four seconds. This one was high-pitched and not as loud as the first. We were still within one hundred yards or so of this creature. The dogs now became much more relaxed, except for the pup, who thought the whole night had been great. We then went home without further incident.<BR>    I&#8217;ll never know what this animal was thinking when he bellowed and growled, but it could have been, &#8220;I&#8217;M here. YOU need to be somewhere else&#8217;&#8217;, because they seemed like warnings to me. I am now about the age my grandpa was at that time and have spent thousands of hours in the woods. I have never heard another sound like that. I am sure I will never hear an animal sound that loud again unless I once again run onto the &#8220;BIG GUY&#8221;. In my life time I have thought I was in danger several times, knew I was a few times, but have never been that scared again, but what the hell, I was still a boy!!<BR>",

    " We were riding our 4-wheelers in Mason Co WV, We were off of Greer Road on a friends property and stopped to get something to eat. This area we were at is not populated at all. I went over and sat on a log to eat and my husband asked me what kind of track was by my foot, When I looked down I was astounded! My husband wears a size 13 boot, And this was in cold weather so the thick boots make his foot look even bigger and this footprint made his look small! it was atleast 16 to 18 in long and 6 to 8 in at the widest point.There were about 3 or 4 more footprints leading down to the creek. I walked up and down the banks looking for more but I couldn''t find anymore. I am 5''9\" and have fairly long legs and I could not put my foot beside one of the prints and reach the other one. This was one of the most amazing things I have ever seen! Regretably none of us had a camra, but there were aprox 15 of us who seen these. Everybodys first reaction was that it was a hoax, but in my opinion if someone was going to fake this they would have done it in a more populated area. Our friend Jack , whos property we were on called the Department of Natural Resourses to ask them about this, they sent one truck down to look at the print. This truck left and came back with about 5 more trucks. They told Jack not to come back there while they were there. After they were done one of them stopped and told Jack that it was only a black bear print, I am no zoologist but I have seen black bear prints, and this was not one. There were no claw marks, but there were toes. And if that was a bear, and it left tracks that big, I wouldn''t want to meet it! This happned in winter of 2001, I have not told very many people because the ones I have look at me like I need to be locked up! I am very glad to find this site, and to share my amazing experince with people who understand! ",

    "A number of incidents over the years, but until now seemed unrelated. We''ve heard the sounds of \"screaming women\" and thought it may be a \"pather\" several times over the years. \"Whooping\" sounds, which we thought were owls. A dog returned home from fighting with something that had torn him with cuts pretty badly. A dog was found dead in his wire pen enclosure, and an impression of a large animal having \"caved\" in the wire. The dog had no marks on him and seemed to die of fright. One early morning hour last fall I was awakened by something pounding on the wood siding of my house, almost like an open hand or fist was smashed into it. Also, I was awakened in the late summer or early fall of 2008, with something very large (it sounded like a man walking) on the metal roof of my house and when \"he\" leaped off it seemed that he didn''t clear the edge and slipped nearer to my window which was on that end of the house. Very nearly scared me to death! I live in a modified A-Frame house, this was on a room addition which juts out toward a heavily wooded hillside. There are only a ten homes in this little valley that lies between two heavily wooded hills.",

    " Just two nights ago,( 2/16/09) my brother who lives up the hollow from my house called a little after 8 p.m. to say he had seen something outside in his yard. It seemed to be turned in the direction of his chicken house, at an angle to him, where it could keep a lookout both toward his house and the driveway which passes on up further into the hollow where there is another house. I have another brother that lives right across the driveway from the first brother. This brother says that two nights (2/14/09) before my brother saw what he did, he thought he saw something standing at the end of my 1st brother''s screened in porch, my second brother was smoking on his screened in porch, and when he opened his screen door to get a better look, my 1st brother''s pole light (which has a short in it) went out, and he couldn''t see anything at all in that direction then. A few years ago, a third brother and neighbor to these other brothers, was walking in the dark without a light to my 2nd brother''s house, and something screamed like a woman at him, and terrified him. This is a man standing 6'' tall and over 300 lbs. My 1st brother is also 6'' tall and over 300 lbs, and the creature he saw was taller and weighed more than he did. But he said it didn''t seem to be fat. It had reddish brown fur-hair. He did not see the facial features due to the profile stance the creature was in and he said that it seemed to be aware that it, my brother yelled out loud, \"What the heck is that!\" and ran toward his front door that opens to his screened porch, he said that he felt the creature heard him and knew it had been observed and when he went to the front door and stepped out on the screened in porch, it was gone. The dogs didn''t show up until my brother yelled for them. I myself have had a couple of things happen to me, that at the time they happened were unexplained but now I wonder if they are not related. Last fall my daughter and myself were leaving her house, she lives at the bottom of my hill near the creek, when something that screamed like a women terrified us. Then I heard what sounded like someone hit the side of my house under the breezeway where my bedroom is located, and I have had what sounded to me like a man walking across my house again over where my bedroom is located and in a minute or two it retraced its steps. I was very frightened to say the least! ",

    " My sighting occurred while working as a security guard on top of a mountain in Logan WV. I was working the graveyard (11pm-7am) shift on top of the mountain at a strip mine that was closing. The company was in the process of moving all of the expensive equipment to another site. I had a little trailer as an office and several large pieces of equipment and machinery surrounded the trailer. The location was sort of in a sinkhole that had been created at the top of this mountain..due to blasting. <BR><BR>I had just made a tour of the area,checking the equipment (probably 200 square yards total) and scanning the woods that surrounded the area. It was around 3am. I found nothing unusual and went back inside the trailer and turned on the radio to listen to a talk show that I had been listening to each night. I started to put on a pot of coffee when I realized that there were no filters. A little building outside kept all the cups, filters, coffee, condiments,  etc., so I walked out to the building and grabbed a bag of filters when I heard a rustle in the brush about 20 yards behind the trailer. I went inside the trailer and grabbed my flashlight and went outside to check out the sound. At first I saw and heard nothing. Then to my right was the sound of something taking off and running through the brush toward the mountain.<BR><BR>The beam of my flashlight caught sight of what I thought, at first, to be a black bear which are quite common in this area. However, as I looked closer, I saw what appeared to be a large bi-pedal animal squatting behind a large thicket about 25 yards from where I stood. The beam from my flashlight raked across its body. It shielded its face with huge hands and then ran off into the night. <BR><BR>Thirty five to forty minutes later, while sitting in the trailer (with the door firmly locked and pistol in hand..lol)  looking out the window, I heard what can only be described as a scream that absolutely chilled me to the bone. I have goosebumps now just thinking about it. <BR><BR>This was about 16 years ago. I have tried many times to convince myself that it was a bear. Deep down I know what I saw that night was not a bear or any animal that I have ever seen or heard, before or since. I really do not know what it was that I saw that night..and have never told anyone until now because I know that most people will just think I am crazy. I don''t make any claims as to what it could be but since then I have researched the \"Sasquatch\" legend and read many books and features on the legend itself. <BR><BR>The only thing I can tell you is this; when listening to a sound recorded in Ohio (I think) it sounded almost identical to the sound that I heard that night. The sound, more than the sighting scared me the most! It was like nothing I have ever heard before or since, except the recording from Ohio. After about another hour on the hill, I got up the nerve to jump in my car and get the hell off the mountain. I never went back to work there again. <BR><BR>I talked to a guy that worked that area for years and he said that he had never seen anything but had heard some very strange screams, he attributed them to mountain lions or bobcats what I heard was no feline. Anyway, I am glad to see so many others have had similar experiences. Keep up the good work. Maybe someday we will find out just what it is that roams our mountains and forests. Who knows?<BR>",

    " I''m a 65 year-old physician living in Ocala Fl. I grew up in Huntington WVa. When I was 14yo I was with my best friend (Bill Roberts) also 14yo and we were walking in the woods behind my grandparents'' dairy farm. We had a 22G rifle with us and we had been roaming around for about an hour when we came to a clearing at the top of a hill. We suddenly saw an animal neither of us recognized. When we first saw it, it was bent over doing something with its upper extremities. We were mesmerized for several minutes and did not move. It then seemed to become aware of us....what happened next really freaked us out. It stood up on back legs and looked right at us. we were terrified...it was very tall...blackish colored hair..also was skinny in appearance with a tapered face. It was standing at the edge of a pine thicket. It turned away from us and jumped over a barbed wire fence. Even though we had a gun we ran as fast as we could back to the farm house to relate the story to my grandfather. I know this description is somewhat different from what you''ve probably heard, but we saw an animal I''ve never seen before or since. S*******  P**** M.D.",

    " It was the summer of 1975, and I was about to enter the eighth grade at Stratton Jr. High School. My best friend had moved away from our neighbor hood in Beckley to Stanaford Acres in the spring. He had invited me to come out and spend the weekend with him in hopes of planning a fishing adventure down to Piney Creek. On Saturday morning, he and a common school friend of ours, and myself ,left out on foot at approx. 7:00am. With fishing gear,lunches and other necessities in hand, we made our way through the woods, past Kliningsmiths Pond, and over to the branch that would lead us to down to Piney Creek which was about a 3 mile hike. After spending the day fishing and doing things that teenage boys do we began to head back up the mountain. As we walked and talked, moving along the rail road that snakes its way through the gorge, it became apparent to us that we may not have been alone. Eerily we all had the feeling that someone, or something, was watching us, and following us from a distance. Paranoia began to set in, and we began to pick up the pace. By the time we reached the branch that we we''re to follow back up the mountain,time was slipping away, and the thought of getting caught in the dark became apparent.After an hour or so of hiking up the branch, the sun had lazily rolled over the mountain top, and although it was still early, it was begining to get a little dusky in the hollow. We had just stopped to take a breather when we heard rustling on an old logging road about 300'' feet above us. I had an old Red Rider BB gun with me, like it would have done any good, and it was rattling in my hands has they trembled. Maybe someone was watching us. Just in a matter of minutes, large boulders, the size of a washer or drier, came down, one after the other, headed right for us. We froze like stone statues, scared to death. After regaining our composure, we let up that hill side as though our feet were not even touching the ground. Thats when, against my better judgement, I turned to look back, just in time to see a large black shape disapear over the hillside. We ran all the way to Sams house, which was still a good mile and a half away. As the years went by, we looked back on that day and laughed at one another, joking about how scared each one of us were, and tried to come up with a reasonable explaination. I don''t know if what I saw was a Big Foot, or a figment of my imagination. But to this day, any time I''m hunting or fishing, on or around the New River Gorge National River,you better beleive that I''m looking over my shoulder.",

The Bigfoot blinked twice while looking at me and then stepped back behind the tree..I viewed it for about 20 seconds while it was looking at me..my mind just couldn''t figure out what it was and I knew what it wasn''t..I had no desire to shoot it and very well could have but my mind and body almost seemed to be in a state of shock while viewing it..I had to cross near the location on the trail out if the woods and I was F''n terrified even with a loaded deer rifle..my hair stood on end when I realized that I would have to go towards the location to get out of the woods..I called my uncle as soon as I got to my jeep and told him..he believed me..I am a VERY honest man and would never lie about this..the thing is though..I never heard it run away or move through the leaves..and you can hear movement from 200+ yards off in these woods..it''s like it just disappeared..I came home very shaken from the experience and it changed my life..now I know that it is out there. It was very cool looking..about 7ft tall, it had very dark large pupils and around the pupils its eyes were almost owl like..it had brownish blond fur and it had a visible face..it almost looked like the troll faces that you used to put on your pencils as kids..really..but, it was very clean looking and not what you would expect..its fingers were long and thick with no fur and it had dark fingernails..I had my scope on 9 power and it was equivalent to being about 30 ft from me visually..it was real and I would take a polygraph and swear on my life.",

It was very still and quiet out until we heard a few coyote''s howl followed by some frogs croaking. <BR><BR>Across the creek was thick with brush and small trees, there was a path that looked like led down to the water. While sitting on tailgate, we started to hear a sound of something walking down the side of the creek. You could hear it slowly taking what sounded like a two beat step. Too heavy for a deer, and too small for a coyote/cat. It hesitated at the pathway, then continued on to the left of us. It then made a loop to the right and came back up only farther away from the bank. Then we heard a hoot owl like sound very close to where we first heard the brush cracking. Then another hoot farther to the right as we could hear the footsteps fade in the distance. Then, about 5 minutes later, we heard a tree fall to the right of us across the creek where we heard the footsteps and hoot sounds.<BR><BR>After all this the frogs started croaking again.

    " I saw a dark shadow and at first thought my eyes were playing tricks on me but when I looked again I saw the outline of a Large man, but covered with hair. It was standing near the edge of the woods and at first I thought it was a statue. When I slowed down and looked closely it started to move backwards taking small steps, this really frightened me bacause even though I was in a car and it was moving away, I realized then what it was and that this thing was very much alive. The only way I can guess its height was buy looking at the pine trees he was standing near and I would say this creature had to be about upper 6 foot, maybe close to 7. With the broadest shoulders I have ever seen. If it was someone in a suit it was someone that should be playing pro basketball, not standing along the edge of the woods. I was close like 50 feet away from this thing at one point and it was early in the morning. I watched until it went so deep that I could not see it anymore, it turned around though and started walking at a better clip after I slowed down and watched for a while. I have not told anyone and never reported it, but when I was younger I believed in Bigfoot, but now I am 26 and was very skeptical the last few years knowing that this thing if it existed would need hundreds of square miles of remote area to be out of sight of people and I did not think anything in Ohio could accomadate that. Maybe out west it''s more thinkable, but Ohio does not even have a resident Black bear or Bobcat poppulation. Could this mammal be so intelligent and elusive that it could remain in our modern world? Does it bury its dead?....I mean somebody find out whats going on with this. Because not all these reports on here can be fake, I know what I saw! <BR>",

    " My sister Mary and I were heading to work at an early morning hour driving northeast on County Road 19 out of Calais, Ohio. My sister was lying back in the passenger seat when I noticed in my car headlights on the left side of the road the head of an animal in the creek bed. I said out loud what then heck is that? My sister became aware that I was looking at something and starting looking too. As I slowed down to see what it was, it came out of the creek bed on two legs and it ran right towards our car. It then ran along the side of our car (five feet away) for a few seconds. We noticed its brown shaggy hair all over its body and its immense size.  Being very scared, we sped off as quickly as possible fearing the animal was going to jump on our car. When we told people what we had seen, they said all we saw was a horse or a large dog. We both know that whatever this thing was, it ran on two legs, had brown shaggy hair, and was extremely large in size.  We estimate that this thing was close to eight feet tall and over 500 pounds in size. It was hard to get a good look at the face because of darkness and it being so close to the car.  There is no way it was a bear or a person.  ",

    " I grew up in the outskirts of a small town of Wellsburg, in the northern part of West Virginia. In the northern panhandle, ever since I was little we would ride our dirt bikes in the old strip mine, that was called center hill. Well years passed and that old mine was reclaimed, well we would still ride over there even though we were not allowed. It was summer because we where out of school. Id say it was probably 1989-1990, me and a friend went trail riding. <BR><BR>There was a flat area, and along the trail was a high wall, on the other side was a drop off, and a road. We would ride that trail to the gas line and cut up over the gas line to the road and go home, or we would turn around and go back through the trails. On the way through the trails there was a pit, we called it the sulfur pit, because it would turn your clothes orange, the color of the water was orange and deep on one side and shallow on the other side. It was like the rest of the trail it butted up against the high wall. <BR><BR>On the day I''m talking about,  I was on my bike and my friend was on his 4 wheeler. We went through the pit and was playing around. We ended up getting the 4 wheeler and my bike stuck. It took a long time to recover the machines. <BR><BR>Later that day we saw something walking on the top part of the high wall. It was not walking on the edge it was walking like along a tree line. We stopped and watched this thing walk to a tree and crouch down. I dont think it knew we were there until we yelled out at it for help. <BR><BR>The guy I was with said it was a friend of ours but we were out there where no one would be walking, even during hunting season. I think he said that so I would not flip out. You dont just walk out that far even during hunting season, cause if you get something there is only two ways to bring it out, up over the high wall or down the high wall. <BR><BR>Im getting nervous just writing this... We continued to yell out to this thing with no response back from it. We yelled out the name of the person that he thought it was several times.. no answer. We even yelled out if it could come down and help us. We did not know what it was.. So probably a good hour went by, and we were still trying to get his 4 wheeler unstuck, the next thing we know this thing gets up and walks the same way it came from. It was big and had long arms down its side. Walked upright like a person. <BR><BR>We watched this thing the whole time it was there, and it watched us working. We did not know what it was or what was going to happen. We did not know what it was going to do.. After it was out of sight we went back to getting his 4 wheeler out. Finally we got his 4 wheeler unstuck and my bike and got out of there. We had to ride the same direction it had walked. A couple days later we saw our friend that was supposed to be over there and he said it was not me. After that nothing else was said about it. We rode and hunted over there a few times. I stopped riding there when I started racing. <BR><BR>A couple years later (1991) when I was a freshman in high school, I took my girlfriend at the time over there. We were just out walking, and a hill that you had to go up to get to the path that went up into the woods. We got to the top of of this hill and heard the brush move, then a grunt noise, and a growl. I turned to her and told her to walk down the hill then run. We left there as quick as we could. <BR><BR>At one point I remember being at my friends house (the same one that got his 4 wheeler stuck) and we were talking with his mom. She said to me  you know there''s a Bigfoot over in the strip mine. I said No, really?!\" She said that her son saw the foot prints. I hunted that area a few times, rode dirt bikes over there and always felt like I was being watched. I have never told no one, just in the past year I told my girlfriend of 8 years. This is the first time I have come out and told anyone my story of what I saw that day, and the other time I was over there. ",

    " It was a warm June afternoon when my dog Sadie and I went for a walk back in the woods on our property. After we walked threw the woods on our property i decided to take the gravel road the mile or so back home instead of traveling threw the woods again. I got a half mile away from the house when i kept hearing something like a rock or a branch hitting against a tree. At first i thought it was just animals or my husband goofing off in the woods to scare me. When i reached where i thought the noise was coming from i stopped and was looking up into the woods, but i couldnt see anything, so i proceed to yell, ha ha very funny because like i said i thought it was my husband. Well the banging got louder then stopped completly. I got the feeling something was watching me so i told Sadie lets go girl and started to walk a little faster. Just then a fairly sized rock came whizzing out of the woods and just missed me. I stopped looked in the woods because i couldnt believe what just happend, but i still couldnt see anything. So, i really started to pick up the pace just then another rock came flying out of the woods and just missed me. By the time all this happend i was at the bend in the road and i looked up in the hollar where the last rock had come from when something i can not explain let out the awfulest low growl then scream i have ever heard. It scared me and Sadie so bad we took off running and i dont think i felt the ground under my feet i was running so fast. I told my husband about it when i got home and realized it was not him he had been there the whole time. A few days later he convinced me to take him back where it all happend and along side the road was a foot print that was fairly large but shaped different. I have not adventured back there since then and really dont care to.",

The pond is located well over a mile behind a gated forest service road off of a gravel county road that runs deep in the national forest above the Cranberry River.<BR><BR>It was likely the summer of 1985.  My best friend, Mark, and I decided to hike back to the pond to go bass fishing and camp for a couple days.  The weather was very nice and the first day had come to an end.  I had caught a bass and it was on a stringer staked to the bank of the pond.  We enjoyed a big fire (started with the aid of a Zippo can of lighter fluid), nice meal and good conversation at our own private paradise buried deep in woods.  The day ended typically with not another soul in sight.  <BR><BR>It was not long after we had lain down to for the night in our sleeping bags that we heard a bizarre howl or yell a good ways up the mountain above us.  It was like a woooooooop, woop, woop, woop sound.  It was a strong, very substantial sound.  The call was repeated a few times and then all became silent again.  We looked at each other, lightly illuminated by the campfire through the tent, and said, what was that?!  Even though we both grew up in the woods camping, hiking biking, hunting, and fishing, neither one of us had ever heard a sound like that before.  Unnerved, we eventually calmed down enough to start to fall off to sleep.  <BR><BR>Then, just inside the woods behind the tiny clearing where we were camping, we heard the call again.  It was jarring!  At a distance of less than 50 feet, the call of this creature blared though our tent!  WOOOOOOOOOOP, WOOP, WOOP, WOOP!!!  We both about died right there.  The sounds being belted out were not from an owl or fox or bobcat or any other creature we were familiar with.  Plus, this thing obviously had big with powerful lungs!  After the first couple calls, I decided that I wanted to see what was going to kill us instead of lying there like a sandwich in a wrapper.  So, I started to reach for my flashlight.  As the nylon of my sleeping bag made a slight sound, Mark clamped down on my arm like a vice grip and firmly whispered through his teeth, dont move!  I told him I wanted to see it.  Again he firmly whispered, dont move!<BR><BR>After a few minutes of bone chilling monster calls being directed toward us point blank range, all became quite again.  Eventually we felt comfortable enough to talk and could not determine what we had heard.  The only thing that we could think of was Bigfoot but the thought of it made no sense.  It took us a while, but we somehow eventually fell off to sleep.<BR><BR>The next morning we awoke in disbelief.  We reviewed our mental notes and realized that we had not shared the same nightmare but rather the same reality.  We had certainly heard something that we could not even begin to rationalize.<BR><BR>As we made our way out of the tent, the world looked the same.  It was a nice morning.  We decided to start a fire and fix some breakfast but our can of Zippo was not readily available.  Then we noticed a small pile of stones where we had left it.  Underneath the rock we discovered our lighter fluid.  Neither of us had covered the can up, and yet, there it was, covered neatly with a pyramid of rocks near the fire pit where we left it.  This was really odd since we were alone while camping in a place that is not readily accessible during the day, let alone in the night.  Plus, the covering of the can would have had to happen in the middle of the night since we were up half the night scared for our lives while the devil himself yelled at us.  We could only guess that a bigfoot had become offended by the smell of kerosene and covered it up himself.<BR><BR>A short time later we made our way down to the pond to do some fishing.  The first thing I did while down there was to check on my catch.  However, my fish was gone, stringer and all.  We each know that losing a fish and a stringer is not uncommon.  However, combined with the event, we thought that a bigfoot could have made off with our fish.<BR><BR>We each left there that day convinced that we had encountered a bigfoot at Glad Run Pond.  We have told this story over and over through the years and it still gives us chills.  My eyes even tear up a bit when I make the woooop sounds.  We each are still avid outdoorsmen.  The hours we have spent in the woods hunting and fishing and camping are substantial.  We even had mules for many years that we used for long multi-night camping and hunting trips into the WV wilds.  We still go to Glade Run Pond from time to time.  However, we have never heard that same sound or had a similar experience again.  Whatever happened that night will never be forgotten by the two of us.  We will be telling this story to our great grand children!<BR><BR><BR>",

I took a short cut through Cranberry Ridge that comes out in Camden on Gauley to get home. It was midnight (12:03 to be exact.) I was almost to the Webster County Line when I saw what I thought at first was some idiot in a monkey suit in the middle of the road in front of me. I beeped my horn at it.He started to run very fast, in long strides and then I realized it wasn''t a man. He wasn''t wearing shoes. His feet looked hairy. He was covered in reddish brown hair and about six feet tall. The hair was all even in length. He ran about quarter of a mile up the hill in front of me then tore through some elderberry bushes and disappeared down the mountain. I only got a really quick glimpse of his face so I can''t accurately describe it. The next day I went back and looked at the spot where he ran through the bushes. There were some kind of prints in the mud holes in the road and the elderberry bushes were broken and bent where it went through.<BR>",

On a mid-summer night around probably 3am, I had driven home, which was about a half hour drive. We had no neighbors and there were no lights on as I pulled up. I parked with the left side of my vehicle facing towards the wilderness line which was about 100 feet uphill. I got out of my car and closed the door. Immediately after my car door closed I had the loudest, most intense scream I have ever heard in my life call out from near the wood line. I ran for the door of the house and once inside I grabbed a shotgun, floodlight, and went back to look outside for it, from inside the screen door of course. I never saw a thing or found a sign of anything. This was the first of three times this happened to me, my mother who lived there as well and also worked late had it scream at her several times(she said 4 or 5) as well, and my brother had it scream at him once.",

    " I was alone, driving after dark from Belington, WV on US 250 North (two lane highway) toward Philippi, WV. About a mile out of town, I had just passed a small group of houses on the right. The highway curves to the right; there is a long guard rail on the right side of the road. As I was coming around the long curve, my headlights caught something up ahead, standing on the white line on the right side of the road. <BR><BR>At first I thought it was a very tall, lanky human, at least 64, with long reddish hair and a long beard, but as I got closer, I realized there were no clothes, just reddish brown hair over its entire body. The hair length and texture reminded me of a horses groomed mane, the hair was smoothed and not matted, and my impression was that it was a very tall monkey type animal. I did not see eyes, I got the impression it had closed its eyes when it was startled by my headlights. It stood frozen as if surprised by my headlights, very stiff, with extra long arms down by its sides. As my car went by it, it did not move, but was so close to my car I thought my right side mirror would hit it, but it did not. The incident lasted only about 10 seconds. My first thought was that it was a skinny Bigfoot, but that those things dont exist and if they do exist, they are not in WV, they are in the Pacific Northwest. <BR><BR>I kept going, as it really scared me, and there was no way I was going back to see what it was. I shook all the way home, I think because it resembled a human somehow, and because it was unlike anything I have ever seen, except in a zoo. When I got home, my daughter and her husband were visiting, we also had family from PA there. I told my family about it privately, they were skeptical, of course, and laughed about it. My husband does believe I saw something, but doesnt have any ideas about what it could have been. <BR><BR>I decided to look this up on the Internet and I saw there were incident reports and even expeditions for WV --- and that there is an incident reported for Barbour County! I almost had a heart attack when I saw this report was in the same area as my incident. I considered reporting it to you then, but was first discouraged from it by family.<BR><BR>I believe what I saw was some sort of animal, and I reasoned that it obviously isnt hurting anything or anybody, and I wouldnt want it hunted down.

    " I was hunting West Virginia''s late antler-less deer season in the Canaan Valley National Wildlife Refuge when the sighting occurred. I had gotten to the area shortly after 3:00pm that evening, and after parking my vehicle in the \"Camp 70\" parking area I hiked up what appeared to be an old logging trail directly behind the parking area. I had already gotten a late start and wanted to get afield as quickly as possible, so I decided to stalk along the logging trail until I got further into the river bottom. After hunting the trail for roughly 30 minutes I was able to see a long distance in the river bottom to my right, so I decided to move into the bottom in hopes a deer would emerge from the thick along the river at dusk. I came across another \"road\" after leaving the logging trail, so I started walking further into the valley on it. The road was frozen and crusted over due to the cold temperatures, which made traveling quietly impossible, so after a short distance I found a small group of trees a few yards from the trail and set up in them. Shortly after arriving I heard what sounded like brush breaking 150 - 200 yards below me, towards the river. I readied myself in hopes it was a group of deer moving into the flats to feed, but nothing appeared. A few minutes passed by and I heard the sound again, and again, nothing materialized. I decided to move closer, and positioned myself in another group of small trees 100 yards or so below my first site. I had been in this grove of saplings for 5 - 10 minutes when I caught movement in a cluster of trees that was about 80 - 90 yards below me and to the left. I could see the movement with my naked eye, and immediately upon seeing it I scoped the group of trees and to my surprise saw nothing. A few minutes went by and I caught the movement again, I quickly scoped the trees, and this time I was shocked by what I saw. At first I thought it was a large man, as the first thing I saw through my scope was a vague silhouette, but when my eyes focused I could see what appeared to be a primate-like creature standing upright and staring directly at me. It only broke it''s stillness to slightly move the upper portion of it''s body in an up and down motion. It would bend it''s knees as if it was going to sit down, then immediately straighten back up. This went on for what seemed to have been over a minute, then the creature exited the group of tree''s and moved to my left (the creature''s right), towards the mountain behind me. It walked across an expanse of river basin that I would guess to be 70 - 80 yards long before entering the timber and exiting my field of view. It kept watching me the whole time it was walking, only breaking it''s stare on me a few times to look directly ahead of it. I initially thought of attempting to locate it''s track''s, but my nerves got the best of me and I started moving towards the parking lot as quickly as I could. Though the creature never actually made any threatening movements, I didn''t feel safe enough to continue hunting and remain in the valley any longer after the sun went down than I had to. I immediately left the area and had no further incidents on the way to my vehicle.",

    " In June I was backpacking the Allegheny Trail going south bound. I had hiked up the trail following the yellow blazes. As I got to the top and started the trek along the ridge line I noticed some of the blazes getting harder to find with what looked like attempts to scratch them off. I say this because I would find the paint chips and bark at the base of the trees. It was raining on and off with a strong wind blowing West/Northwest. The trail had quit a few blow-downs and up-roots but I also would come across smaller trees broken off or up-root laying across the trail opposite the wind direction. I was hiking toward a shelter along the trail using my map book and came upon it late in the afternoon. The following morning I was awoken by a loud noise nearby. At first I could not identity the sound but then I realized it was to Flat Creek, stones being \"clacked\" together. The sound would at first be close by and then a few seconds later would be repeated farther away until it was almost out of ear shot and then it would return getting louder and louder passing by and diminishing in the other direction. It was in a north to south direction back and forth several times and then it stopped. Soon after that I felt and heard movement on the outside of the shelter and something stepped heavily on an old plastic tarp that was left spread out along the side of the shelter at that point I yelled \" get out of here\" and I did not hear any thing more. It was very unnerving.",

Well as I got to the end of the drive way the bus came and stopped and I went across the street to get my little girl off the bus and I turned around and at first was talking to my daughter I didn''t look straight ahead in front of me but when I looked up I noticed a very large brown figure standing below my porch which was second story and as I walked up holding my daughter''s hand it just stood there staring at first I couldn''t figure out what it was I have been in WV all my life and had seen many bear, bobcats and even a cougar. So I knew this was not any of these and it was standing at least eight foot tall with man like features it had kind of a flat nose its eyes were shaped like an owls and it blinked several times it didn''t move the whole time we were walking to the other side of my porch to go up the steps. In fact we even looked down on it from the upstairs porch.

    " A friend and I were out training my red-tick coon hound on Saturday Aug. 2, 2008. We drove up a familiar dirt road. We drove to the end and were on our way back when the dog had struck out of the back of the truck. I got out, turned on my mining light, and walked to the back of the truck.<BR><BR>I opened the tailgate and let the dog loose. I stood beside the truck watching the dog sniff around in the road for a minute or so. I was shining my light around in the woods around me, when I saw a set of eyes looking at me. The eyes were a bluish green color and appeared to be 5-6 foot off the ground. I stood and watched it for at least 2-3 minutes wandering what it was. I hollered at my friend who was still sitting in the passenger side of the truck to come and look and tell me what he thought it was. We both stood there watching it, trying to figure out what it was.<BR><BR>The creatures eyes would blink every now and then but it did not show any fear toward us or the dog. It was about 40 yards or so from us just enough so you could not see its body. We wanted to get a closer look so we decided to walk toward the creature. <BR><BR>We only had 1 flashlight and for us to get closer we had to cross a small ditch and a broken down fence. I was trying to hold the light on the creatures eyes, and hold the light so my friend could see so he did not fall. As we struggled to get across I noticed the eyes disappeared. We hollered for the dog to come with us and we walked approx. 40-50 yards to where the creature was standing but did not see anything. <BR><BR>We stood there for about 5 minutes talking and letting the dog sniff around, but he acted a little nervous. We started walking back to the road. When we got back to the road we were about 60 yards from behind the truck. As we were walking back to the truck, I was hollering for my dog to come on, and I shined my light up in the woods where we left from, and the set of eyes returned.<BR><BR>We looked at it for about 15 seconds then noticed a second pair of eyes this time, The second pair of eyes were orange- red color and seemed to be taller than the first set. At this time we were spooked and made our way swiftly to the vehicle. When we got to the vehicle, we got inside and I shined my light out the window and both sets of eyes were staring at us blinking and showing no fear. <BR><BR>I started up my truck and hollered for my dog to come on let''s go. The dog jumped in the bed of the truck, I jumped out, ran to the back, and hooked the dog up. I ran and got back in the truck, I shined the light out the window on the creatures, still staring at us, and my red-tick coon hound seen the creatures standing in the woods and started barking with every breath.<BR><BR>The creatures continued to stare at us blinking and showing no fear. We decided it was time to get going. We started driving down off the hill. We drove a couple hundred yards and the dog was still barking with every breath. From the way the dog was acting, I felt they were following us. I shined my light uphill beside me and sure enough, there they stood. I watched both of them follow us for about 1/2 mile.<BR>",

    "  There is a church where I attend services. We were practicing our Christmas play on the evening of November 12th 2001. It was about 8:45 p.m. when we finished practicing, when myself (age 17) and 3 other teenagers (15, 14, and 16) decided to go for a walk, while the adults stayed inside to talk.<BR>My cousin ran ahead and hid behind a pine thicket. These pines are in someones yard, they are probably about 12 or<BR>13 ft. tall, and they are all in a row and real close together. Myself and the other two decided to turn back and head toward the church, not realizing that my cousin was not with us. We were to the end of the pines and starting up the church driveway, when she came running out from behind the trees screaming at the top of her lungs and stating that she had seen something.<BR>Just as I turned around, I saw a Very Tall and muscular looking figure walk out from the trees, and cross the road. It was about 7 to  7 1/2'' Tall and slightly hunched over swinging it''s arms well below it''s thigh area, almost to the knees. It turned it''s whole upper torso area and glanced at us while it was walking up the hillside. After we got into the car my cousin, still very petrified, stated that when she was behind the pine trees, something about 5 feet away from her pulled<BR>back a branch on one of the trees as if to get a better look at her.<BR>She stated that it''s eyes were very far apart and sunk deep<BR>into it''s face. She said the hand was 3 times the size of my uncles hand,(he is a large man, and he is her step father). She said that the hand was covered on top with coarse looking hair and it had black fingernails. She said she didn''t smell or hear anything.  She said the reason was, that her face was so cold and her nose was plugged up and she couldn''t have smelled nothing anyway. She said the creature was very tall about 7''-7 1/2'' tall and very muscular. It''s forehead was sloped and the top of its head looked like it had tufts of hair coming into a peak.<BR><BR>Note; (This is exactly the way she described it to my family and hers.)<BR><BR>",

I''d go onto the place after the workers left for the day at 3PM.<BR><BR>It was rather hot and plain nasty so I usually headed out after 4 -5 PM. This day they were at the far end of the valley (or \"holler\" as the locals call it-I''m from CA originally). I was armed as there are wild dogs, bears, and a black panther running round back here.  Walking to the far end there are two smaller branches off to your right, the first is shallow and only extends a few yards.<BR><BR>Every time I walked to base of the hill before, I felt like I just didn''t want to venture into the woods. I had found another way onto the ridge above on the right a few months before-but I also got pretty badly spooked and kind of stayed away.<BR><BR>I had trails and just went wherever-until the loggers hit this patch. The past few weeks before this I had roamed all over the logging trails and as soon as they got back there I began to feel very uneasy. Walking alone, I decided to keep looking around staying extra cautious.<BR><BR>This day I went left and followed a trail that took me to the ridge top which is dead center of the valley. I also had a very \"something is watching me\" feeling so I wasn''t what you would call happy, just taking note of where things were and enjoying the view.<BR><BR>The trail followed along this ridge and would take me near where I had all the strange feelings. I stopped as the feeling of being watched was getting a bit too much when I heard a tree fall, just on the other side of the ridge not more than about maybe seventy yards away. I was wondered just why in the hell would a tree fall but something told me not to investigate and to get off that hill.<BR><BR>I decided to turn around to call it a day. I walked maybe ten yards when something loped between two trees on the ridge to my right. My first thought was some loggers or forestry guys were still on the property. It looked to be wearing Carhart brown clothes. I went maybe twenty more yards and then it hit me: I had been on that ridge a few days before, I knew where those trees were and if, IF it was a man he had to be around seven to eight feet tall.<BR><BR>A day or two later I went back to the ridge where I saw the thing and took a good look. I never felt any real strangeness on this side and didn''t then, but I did confirm that whatever I saw was very big. I also could swear I saw the right arm and leg but not the head, thinking back it was kind of leaning forward as it walked along so the head was behind the tree when I noticed it.<BR><BR>",

    " There are three encounters that I have had not in the physical or in another words I did not have a visual sighting but had heard weird behavior in the woods.<BR><BR>To begin with I am a 40 year responsible adult male and I have not told anyone about these encounters or experiences that I have had for fear of being ridiculed and/or being labeled as loony by my friends, family and the community. I found this website many years ago on my own by accident and was surprised to read about others who had the same experiences as I had. I finally found the courage to tell you what had happened to me.<BR><BR>I have been in and lived near the woods all my life. In my family hunting is a tradition. All the animal noises and natural sounds of the woods I know and am familiar with and have honed over time a very acute sense and perception that most hunters have or any outdoors man would have honed. <BR><BR>I would go sqirrel hunting often after work along some railroad tracks that ran just a quarter of a mile from my home at the time. One late fall afternoon I was just walking with my .22 mag rifle at the ready quietly along the tracks when I heard a noise or a rustling of leaves in the woods when I suddenly stop and stood motionless while I scanned the woods with my eyes looking for the source of the noise thinking it my be a large gray or fox squirrel. After awhile I did not hear nothing more so I moved on.<BR><BR> Now I have hunted alone many times and had never been afraid of anything but just after I had moved on I began to hear what sounded like foot steps in the woods just behind me and parelling me 50 to 75 ft. away. At first I thought of deer or a dog or a person walking up in the woods and after a few minutes I decided to call out to who ever may be there and let them know that I was where I was there for safety precautions. Well there was no reply and I called out a couple more times just to be sure. No reply. So as it was about 1/2 hour before sunset I was compelled to call it quits for that day and head back to my truck which was parked about a mile back near the RR. <BR><BR>Whatever it was proceeded to follow me keeping pace with me at a parallel distance of 50 ft. It became more and more clear that what ever it was was heavy and big for several times along the way back I heard loud heavy branches breaking and heavy footfalls that I know could not have been a deer or bear (there has not been a bear seen in the area that I was hunting for as long as I can remember nor have I had ever found any sign of one in that area.). Every time I would stop it would stop and when I moved it moved this when on until I came to the area near where my truck was parked and was an opened field. Whatever it was followed me right up to where the wood line was about to end and the field begin. <BR><BR>The other encounter happened in the same area only a year or two later and this time the unknown animal was shadowing me on the other side of the tracks between the tracks I was on and the river. There was a heavy growth of rhododendron bushes that ran the entire length of the shelf of land that was about 50 yards wide from the river to the tracks. <BR><BR>There is an embankment that is an accent of 75 ft. from the rhododendron bushes to the tracks above where I was at. I could see the wake that this thing was making from time to time through the rhododendron bushes for it was right in the middle of them as it was keeping up with me, which was remarkable to me how it did that without exposing itself in some manner, but again I thought through all the possibilities of what it could be for there are few animals that would follow you for a mile stopping and starting in sync with your every step. <BR><BR>I never saw any part of it as it moved through the brush and even though I could see a wake made by the branches as it moved through the thick brush it was only here and there, mostly it was if a large contortionist where moving through the heavy with the brush with the utmost of ease. <BR><BR>The third time was near spruce knob in Pocahontas County, WV while on a field trip for a summer class I was taking in the spring of 2003 some of my fellow classmates and I were outside one night trying to call in Bard Owls. After some minutes later we heard a few in the pine trees near our camp returning our calls. <BR><BR>We were having fun with our success with calling them in and after 30 minutes we had called in 4 or 5 more in the pine trees that bordered the road across the road from our camp. Then all of a sudden while in the act of making more calls we heard a huge commotion up on the hill about 75 yards. from us it sounded like a couple of huge guys romping around and making the Bard Owl call, we all stood there trying to make out what it was but could not see anything. Someone shined a flashlight in the direction of the sounds and they ceased immediately. <BR><BR>We did night hear anything more on that hill that night. I do not know for sure what it could have been but would not rule out that it could have been a bigfoot. ",

Then we saw its side arm move and it looked like it was below its knees.

    " My older brother and his son decided to try and get a picture of this creature.  They took their 4 wheeler back to the second field that is just behind the one it has been seen in.  The waited for it to walk in.  After some time of sitting they started to smell a horrible stench. My brother stood up to look in the woods behind them and he saw the creature squatting down behind a tree.  My brother then moved to get a better look at it when it stood up and left.  He then went to look for it and saw it foot imprint on some leaves on the ground, he said they weren''t very good but he could see that its foot prints where about 5 feet apart. <BR><BR>My older brother, his wife and 6 year old son were riding on their 4 wheeler back in old 93 hollow.  It was between 7:00pm - 8:00pm when they saw what they thought to be a black bear walking on its hind legs.  They stopped the 4 wheeler and turned off the engine to watch it. When they did this the creature also stopped and was watching them.  My brother and His wife saw the creature and they looked at each other over a distance of around 200 feet for about 2 minutes.  My sister-in-law described it to me this way.  When it turned to face us, I could see through its legs.  Its legs were not touching together.  Its arms hung down its side just above its knees, and its shoulder and mid drift were real broad.  It had fur from head to toe.  <BR><BR>Two minutes later the creature took off into a stride across the field with its arms swinging at its side and a slight bend to its form.   At the end of the field it turned and went into the woods.  At that distance they could see it as it walked through the woods.  They figured it to be about 8 - 9 feet tall.  They said it could not have been a bear walking on its hind legs covering the distance it covered in the short time it covered it.   They watched it enter into the woods and then went home.  When they got home their son, scared from what he had just seen, started crying.  He swore to his mom he was never going to ride his bike or motor bike in that hollow ever again. <BR><BR>The next day my brother took my younger brother and my uncle back in the hollow with him to see if they could find any tracks this creature had made.  They searched but did not find any, it was over grass and it rained most of the night.  So my older brother gave up and went home leaving my younger brother and my uncle in the hollow.  Shortly after my younger brother and uncle saw the creature.  They were in the same location as my other brother was the night before.  They watched it come out of the wooded area about 400 yards below them and cross the road.  It went down the a hill into a valley where they couldn''t see it.  Then suddenly it came up on the other side of the hill and walked along side the edge of the field and entered the wooded area where it did (or another) the night before.  My brother got to see it through his binocular and said it looked like a pro basket ball player but much more muscular with fur from head to toe.  He said all he could see was its back side and it wasn''t anything he had ever seen before.  My brother also said he yelled at it but it didn''t faze the creature at all. <BR><BR>Two days later, in the morning my older brother and his wife went to the same area to go mushroom hunting.  They were in the power lines when they heard a loud knocking on one side in the woods, like someone hitting something on a tree.  Across on the other side, where one old dilapidated house was, they heard something screaming.  My brother described it as a high pitch hunting dog scream.  They said this went on continuously.  My brother started to walk down toward the house to see what it was.  The closer he got the more it spooked him, so he went back and got on his 4 wheeler leaving his wife on top of the power lines.  His wife said when he started up his 4 wheeler and headed down the road toward the house the knocking got louder and the screaming got louder and more intense.  She said the one that was in the woods knocking started crashing through the woods in the direction that she was in, then stopped when it heard the 4 wheeler turning back.  My brother, who turned around because the screaming was so loud he heard it over his loud 4 wheeler, then got his wife and left the area shaken up a little.  They didn''t think the creature would be there in the morning, they thought they slept during the day or something. <BR><BR>They and other people have gone back to the same area in the two days since the last encounter and nothing was found or heard. <BR><BR>",

    " On Nov. 24th 2015 I was hunting deer during FIREARM season back on the hill behind my house...I am going \"bonkers\" for lack of a better word, trying to process what I saw that day. I was walking up an old dirt road, the ground was wet, leaves etc. so I was very quiet. I reached an area where I was looking down into the forest , I raised up my binoculars because I, at that moment, was expecting to see a smaller black bear...as I was looking at its back I noticed a very thin white hair line running down the middle of its back...I thought that''s a strange marking for a black bear...I continued watching this \"creature\" for quite a few minutes...I wanted to see its face...slowly it turned its head and as if it were looking into my eyes through the binoculars. Its face was solid black of the blackest night, very shiny, looked almost like black leather stretched tight, its nose was very wide and had huge nostrils, it seemed to be hunkered down by an old fallen tree and it was in the sunshine that was beaming through parts the forest, it had no hair on its face..everything was black ..its face looked human, I could see ears like mine only black its hair on its body was a lighter black than its face and somewhat thin (compared to a black bear''s) and it wasn''t dirty or mangled, it looked clean. In the mean time as I was steadily watching it, small sandstone rocks were coming down by me from the road above I didn''t want to turn and look, I was watching the creature below me and figured it was chipmunks running around behind me causing small rocks to fall but after seeing that face I had to look...I saw nothing behind me...when I returned to using the binoculars and looking for it ...It was gone... no sound what-so-ever. I now feel that something behind me was trying to get my attention so it could get away. Someone said that it was probably a man in one of those strange looking suits to hunt in...my reply was \"he needs to get mental help immediately for the fact that everyone on this mountain this week are carrying high powered rifles\". (I never once felt scared or threatened, all was calm) I saw no limbs arms legs.. I was focused on its head... It wasn''t huge like the width of it...as I stated before from behind looked like a small bear (except it had a human like face)... I would appreciate any feed back. (forgot to mention that in October and part of November during bow season I heard some very strange sounds during 3 of my hunting days up there...I call them \"jungle sounds\" ooh ooh ooh aah aah aah woooo repeated at a fast pace)",

    " It was Thanksgiving night of 2003 at around 11:30pm. I had taken a friend of mine home and was driving back on route 50 near Burlington, WV (that''s in Mineral Co.) I came around a turn and slammed on my brakes to avoid hitting what I thought might be a very large dog. <BR><BR>I barely missed hitting it and as soon as I stopped I realized that this was definitely not a dog. It was too big. It was on the right side of the road, crossing to the left. It was black and walking on all fours, its front legs were longer than the back legs. I was petrified. I had no idea what it was. <BR><BR>When it got to the left side of the road it turned and looked at me, its eyes were glowing orange in my headlight. I couldn''t even scream. I had chills all over and tears were rolling out of my eyes. I sped home which was about 4 miles away and ran into my house. I was hysterical and crying and I woke up my mother and told her about it. She believed me. <BR><BR>Other people didn''t believe me and I was made fun of. I referred to it as a \"black demon\" basically because I didn''t know what it was. I can''t drive by that place in the dark to this day without thinking of that creature and praying that I never see it again and if I do that someone will be with me. Seeing a picture of the Jacob''s Creature on MSNBC tonight prompted me to check out your website. It looks exactly like what I saw that night<BR>",

    " Around 1:00 am on October 1st, I got up out of bed to get a drink of water and was having trouble falling asleep. As I walked by my kitchen window, I peered out and noticed three pairs of red eyes walking single file about 20 yards up in the woods. I''ve been a hunter and outdoorsman since I was 6 yrs old and have seen many animals and eyes at night so I wasn''t all that surprised. But what really had me perplexed was the height at which the eyes were above ground level. I would estimate that the eyes were hovering around the 7 ft mark at least so that rules out any wildlife that I''m familiar with. The intensity of the glowing red was also unlike anything I have ever experienced or seen before and the creatures appeared to be walking with comfortable balance and agility. It was pitch black and could not make out any silhouettes except a few branches moving. There is 4 miles worth of wilderness behind my house and most of it is government land. I have no idea what I saw that night but am open minded to it being a sasquatch or another creature that I''m unfamiliar with. Have not talked much about it to other people and am afraid people will think I''m losing it but I can''t stop thinking about what I saw. Thanks very much!",

    " So much time has elapsed since this incident, so I am not sure of exact dates and times, so those aspects will be approximations.  However, I DO remember EXACTLY what I saw.<BR><BR>It was approximately 9pm, and it was dark and cold.  I believe it was around Thanksgiving.  My girlfriend lived, at that time, on Green Mountain, about 6 miles outside of Keyser, WV.  The area is hilly to mountainous and I will enclose a mapquest picture of the area (although it has changed a bit since the picture was taken).  It is technically Rt. 46/4, and the sighting occured along this route, what is  now known as Green Mountain Road locally, but older maps may list it as \"Hoover Hollow Road\".  <BR><BR>I was returning home after dropping her off.  I was alone and beginning my descent back down the mountain, at approximately the halfway point.  <BR><BR>The road changes levels several times in a short distance at this point; many dips and slight rises before the meat of the descent begins.  I was in this section and on one of the rises when something on the left side of the road caught my attention.  There appeared to be someone sitting on a log on the bank above the road; the \"person\" looked at me and I realized it wasn''t a person at all.  The motion of the creature-- for lack of a better term-- indicated that I had startled it-- very sharp, quick movements.  The eyes glowed yellowish/amber as my lights hit them; the being had long brownish fur with strands of white (maybe) through it; it appeared matted, or dreadlocked; the feature that struck me most was the size of the thing-- I can''t even imagine the actual numbers but, I have a 300 pound Brother-in-law and a 6''3\" tall Brother and they both would have been dwarfed by this guy, both in height and weight.  I would conservatively estimate the creature to have been at least 400lbs and every bit of 7 feet tall.  Upon seeing my car, this creature stood up and jumped from the bank, landing somewhere near the middle of the 2 lane road, and began to run from left to right, into a deep pine and laurel thicket.     <BR><BR>I do not know why, but I stopped near the point that the creature entered the thicket and turned my vehicle off.  My windows were rolled down slightly, so I could hear the thing running through the thicket-- the sound receded quickly, as if it was moving with considerable speed.  I listened for mere seconds, before recognizing the stupidity of my actions forced my hand and I continued on.  <BR><BR>As I drove on, I saw what appeared to be a fire burning directly ahead of me.  The road bends to the right and the fire was actually on the same side of the road as the point where I observed the creature.  Around the fire, I saw several people.  They were talking and partying.  To me, it appeared that the spot where the creature was sitting was a PERFECT observation point for the happenings at the campfire.  And, I remembered him (I say \"him\" because I got the distinct impression of masculinity from this enormous creature-- barrel chest, thick arms and legs and just a \"maleness\" to it''s movements) turning his head to face me and it turned in a way to suggest that it was looking TOWARD the clearing where the fire was burning.  I remember thinkin, \"Huh...  He just wanted to see what they were doing\".<BR><BR>I immediately called my girlfriend after observing the campfire.  I told her that I think I just saw a Bigfoot, and I related what I saw.  She panicked and told me to come get her, but I was too spooked by then to turn around.  ",

    " August 1974 I and my three friends Tom, Byron, and Jay went camping with their parents who slept inside their camper while we slept on the ground with a plastic tarp draped over us.  It had been raining the day before.  Around 2 am I was awakened by an eerie screaming.  It sounded like a woman was being murdered.  It freaked me out.  The screaming was across the Stillaguamish River which was about 50 meters from where we slept and into the forest on the other side.  Across the river was a steep incline into the rustic forest and beyond that was nothing but wilderness all the way into Canada.  The screaming became louder and louder as the thing that was screaming was getting closer.  I heard it walking down the steep hill on the other side of the river, and then I heard it walk up and down the other side of the river, screaming all the more.  It was very loud and very scary.  It gave me the impression that it was angry.  Angry at us for being in its area and it wanted us out.  That was my impression.  I was scared to death and I did not know what to do.  Then, suddenly, the thing walked across the river towards me!  It came to my side of the river and began to walk up and down the river bank screaming all the louder.  Then it stepped on a fallen tree that was on the river bank and I heard a snap as the weight of the thing broke the log as it stepped on it.  Then the thing walked up to me and my friends and came within 10 feet of us and screamed some more.  I thought it was going to kill us.  Just then I noticed the terrible odor that this thing had.  It was overwhelming!  It was so strong it made my eyes water.  I was petrified.  I was too scared to move, to speak, to do anything.  I really thought it was going to kill me.  It was lasting forever!  This thing was standing over top of me, screaming, smelling horrible, and scaring me to death.  Then he started to simply walk away.  It went back to the river and walked across it to the other side.  Then it climbed up the steep hill and into the forest screaming all the time.  The screams became farther and farther away.  When it was a good distance away I started to believe that it wasnt going to kill me.  I then asked my friends, Tom, Byron, Jay, did you guys hear that?  They all three jumped up and yelled at me yes what the hell was that?  It seems they were just as terrified as I was and were frozen stiff with fear.  The entire episode lasted for approximately 25 minutes.  What did I see?  I saw nothing because it was pitch black dark.  I heard and smelled everything.  It was as real as it could possibly have been and we are convinced that it was some kind of monster.  It walked on two legs just like a human.  I have been shot at, artillery shelled, sniper shot at, have had a hand grenade tossed at me, survived an ambush, and IEDs while in combat.  I have been attacked by a 12 foot shark while scuba diving.  I have been face to face with three adult man eating lions that were pets of Saddam Husseins son.   Nothing can compare with the fear that I felt this day.         ",

I know the story of course but never payed any real attention to it until I came home from the trip.<BR><BR>We arrived at the campground late.  There was only 1 other camper there with a RV.  We started into the woods around 5pm.  The terrain is extremely rugged and steep.  As we were hiking we noticed that it was very quiet.  Not a single bird call, or anything.  It was an eerie feeling.  We set up camp about 3 miles on the path that led up to the observation tower (High Knob).  We had dinner and got into the tent around 9-10 pm.  Around 11-12 pm my brother and I heard a very odd howl, it lasted for around 10 seconds.  It was not a dog or bear or anything I had heard before.  I thought it was strange but assured my brother it was nothing.  Around 2 pm my friend woke me up and pointed at his ear, signaling me to listen.  I paused and listened.  To me I heard what sounded like someone  slowly walking up to our tent, choosing their steps very carefully.  I whispered to him its a deer to calm his nerves.  But all three of us listened as the steps got closer.  The steps were heavy but slow.  My brother said to me \"Get the shotgun.\"  But not in a whisper.  The steps stopped and sounded like they went the other direction.  I got out of the tent and saw nothing, it was too dark.  The next morning we continued up the hill.  At the top of hill .5 mile from where we camped there was a large pile of feces with acorns in it.  Possibly bear, not sure.  My brother was in poor psychical condition and could not continue so we decided to leave.  <BR><BR>When I got home I decided to see if i could find an animal call matching the sound we had heard.  I looked up a lot of different animals, from cougars to foxes.  Nothing matched.  Until I found a bigfoot website with sound recordings.  The first one I clicked was it.  I called my brother on the phone and said recognize this?  Played the recording and he said \"Hell yeah, that''s what we heard in the woods.\"  <BR><BR>I''ve done a lot of research on Bigfoot since that trip and I''ll be going back there this November, I''ll try and do a few calls or knocks and see what happens.<BR>",

    " On August 30 2012 between 9:07-9:45pm. I was traveling to my father''s home in the Moyers area of Pendleton county, WV. I decided to stop along side of a small road, county rt 25 Moyers Gap rd. I stopped half way up Hoover mountian when I heard an unusual howl sounding like three woops (I''m pretty certain it was three). Being familiar with both wild animal sounds and those of farm animals I was startled because I immediately thought of sounds I''ve heard Bobo make on the show. I cupped my hands around my mouth and attempted to recreate the sound i just heard. I gave three loud woop sounds in medium tempo. After about 5-10 seconds I heard two woop sounds coming from the same direction as the first down over the mountain to my left. Again I cupped my hands and let out two loud woop sounds in about the same tempo as i had just heard. This time I heard a sharp crack of wood and a different type of howl, it sounded angry or frustrated maybe? to me. Unfortunately, a white gmc pick up truck began coming down the mountain. The loud crack and howl were the last sounds I heard that night. I waited for about 45 minutes in the truck I was driving, several times I attempted to get responses by making woop sounds none of my calls were returned again. I was so excited by this encounter. I will never forget it",

    " A buddy of mine and I had wanted to hike and camp in the Dolly Sods Wilderness in West Virginia, in the Monongahela forest. Basically, it was a weekend camp, hoping to spot game and look for trout water. Any thoughts of Bigfoot, (there had been previous reports) were largely in the back of my mind, although the prospect of possibly encountering or seeing evidence was exciting to consider. <BR><BR>The area is quite remote, and the terrain fairly rugged. We had parked the truck on a forest service road, and hauled our gear into the woods. We spent the early afternoon scouting about, after pitching our tent in a small glen surrounded by pine trees. We spotted some deer and raccoon tracks along an adjacent small stream, and looked for whatever sign we could find, then headed back to camp. As we sat there, the atmosphere of such wilderness led my thoughts to Bigfoot. To amuse myself, I got up and started to peruse the woods a bit. About that time, I heard footsteps behind me and turned to see a couple of men walking down a trail carrying garbage bags on their backs. They stopped at our camp and my buddy and I talked with them a few minutes. They had been collecting ramps. Ramps are like wild onions. And they had a good haul, about 40 lbs worth between them. Half jokingly and half serious I asked them if they had heard tales of Bigfoot in the area. Their eyes kind of flew open for a second, then they gave me a look like I was crazy. They didn''t say anything for a few seconds, then looked down at the ground, kind of averting their eyes. I quickly told them about the reports I''d read, but they seemed like they didn''t want to discuss anything. We talked a bit more about ramp selling and Appalachian festivals and such; and I asked them where the ramp patch was and they told us it was on the backside of the hill fronting our tent. Soon they had to leave, but curiously enough, as they were walking away, one of the men turned and said, \"Y''all watch fer them Bigfoot now!\" in a matter-of-fact kind of way. Well, after awhile, my buddy and I decided to take a little foray up one of the trails, and had an enjoyable time--spotting hawks, many birds, bobcat sign, squirrels, and even a Great Horned Owl. We also heard a Barred Owl. We sat in the woods and talked, and planned to do some predator calling after nightfall. I think it was about six o''clock by this time, so we headed back to camp get something to eat. We rustled up some food without cooking anything and the sun was lowering, the night was soon to be coming on. We were debating where we should go try to predator call. Not long after, I head what I can only describe as howls and chatter-like sounds emanating from behind a hill. My buddy had gone back to the truck to get a flashlight we had left behind. As I listened, I could differentiate three separate sources for the sounds. It seemed like they were near each other, not calling to each other from a distance. I also noted that hound dogs were barking off to my right and in behind me from maybe a half-mile away. The howl-like sounds lasted only 30 seconds or so. I just sat there astounded. My buddy soon showed up, and I asked him if he had heard anything. \"Hound dogs\" he replied. I didn''t say anything more to him about it, because I thought he might think I was gettin''nervy. Anyhow, I was primed for excitement that night. After supper, we sat up until late listening to the sounds of the night. Nothing unusual happened. Finally, went to sleep, but I''ll admit I was catnapping most of the night. The next day passed much as the previous one, spotted wildlife and nice hike up to the \"plains\", and then back to camp. We milled about the camp area, and planned to predator call that night....After predator calling, without much response except for two owls, we cooked up some ramps and potatos and talked ''til about midnight. We never bothered to make a fire. After the day''s hiking, a good sleep was welcome. About 2:30 a.m. I was awakened by the sound of our cookware being rattled. I lay there listening, and heard a buck snort. Then he stamped several times. The buck was after the ramps we had leftover from supper. Alright, I thought, back to sleep. I lay there waiting to drift off, listening to the buck mill about the camp. Then, I heard the buck snort loudly. Suddenly, I got an innate sense that something sizable was peering at the tent...I felt a presence there in the pines, which were about 15 feet away. The buck, after slowly moving away, finally bounded away from the glen. I fumbled around for the flashlight, not wanting to awaken my buddy. I couldn''t locate it. Of course, I was still listening intently for whatever was there in the pines. I heard no movement. But that feeling of being scrutinized was raising the hair on my neck. I deliberated what to do. I had no weapon, except a machete. No means of startling what I felt had to be Bigfoot. It was just standing there, there was no discernable movement. I was ''paralyzed'' as to what to do. Finally, I decided to do nothing, just lay there. I''ve had bears sniffing my tent and checking out my campsites before, and found that not confronting them is a good policy. I lay there waiting to see what would happen next. Maybe five minutes later, I heard tree branches moving and a few twigs snap. Then, nothing...I drifted off to sleep. Next morning, I awoke eager to check out the pine stand and campsite. I told my buddy about the buck visit, and decided to tell him about the strange presence lurking in the pines. He listened without saying anything. I wanted to look around, and evidently my buddy''s curiosity got the best of him, and he joined the search. After a few minutes, I found a footprint. It was about 16 inches long and maybe 5-6 inches wide. The big toe was quite clear, and the other ones just slightly less defined. The big toe was maybe two inches wide. The soil where the footprint was dry, kind of grainy not loamy. It was hard-packed and there were pine needles surrounding. The footprint was visible but not deep in the soil. My buddy was quite intrigued by the footprint. We talked about what I had experienced, and dawdled over the footprint. But, it became evident my buddy didn''t believe tht Bigfoot had made the footprint. Or better stated he wouldn''t accept what he was looking at. He even smudged the toes to make it undiscernable. Of course, I was caught off guard by that and made somewhat peeved.<BR><BR>Further thoughts: In retrospect, I feel kind of stupid for not having tried to look at the creature. At the time, I thought I was doing the right thing, it could have precipitated an attack. However, I could sense the largeness of what had to be Bigfoot. *I noticed the breathing,the inhalations of the creature as well, which further informed me of its size. ",

The funny thing is that they appeared ape like but the fur was short and I am really serious that these two creatures did not run they took a big head first dive into those bushes.  I did fish the next day but as far as camping that was a big OUT, NO WAY on this trip.                  ",

    " I didn''t actually see the creature, but was riding in the car with my boyfriend when all this occurred.<BR><BR>We were coming back from a trip to Ohio with a detour to see some friends in West Virginia. Instead of taking interstates home to Virginia, we took US 33, a very twisty mountain road, heading east. I was dozing in the passenger seat when I was startled by my boyfriend yelling \"what the hell was that?!\" I sat straight up, and noticed that whoever was in the car behind us suddenly hit the brakes and flashed up the high beams. We were only going about 30 anyway because we were rounding a curve, so he got a pretty good view of whatever it was. His first description was \"some guy was walking on the road in a tree costume.\"<BR><BR>After he told me a few more details, I yelled, \"Sasquatch! That''s what you saw!\"<BR><BR>I immediately took some notes.<BR><BR>This is what he says that he saw: human-like figure, at least six feet tall and very bulky, with very long hair (\"the hairiest thing I''ve ever seen\"). It was a mossy grayish green color. It was walking along the side of the road upright like a man, but slightly hunched over with knees bent and elbows sticking out (\"an ape-like walk, definitely not human\"). It had no distinguishable facial features, because it was so hairy. He says the arms were six to eight inches wide and the legs were wider, at least eight inches. The creature also did not react to the sound and light from our car or the one behind us. He says it was absolutely not a bear, deer or large dog.<BR><BR>Without our headlights, it was completely dark with just a little moonlight. The creature had no light source, and if it was a man (in a pretty elaborate costume), it was on a heck of a walk because there was not anything within reasonable walking distance, especially with no light.",

    "Nothing else noted at that specific location, but some years later a caver from the same group was with me at another bizarre event. About six miles to the south west of this camp location we found an unknown cave in a remote grazing area. The entrance was partially blocked by breakdown (boulders) but enterable on hands and knees after climbing over the rocks. Just inside the entrance there''s a low room with a stream in the floor that flows into passage heading down stream, deeper into the mountain. Blocking our way was the carcass of a large white tail doe. Something had been feeding on the carcass, as the entrails and soft tissue between the rear legs was pulled out or gone. Deer hair was also strewn about the floor and walls of the cave passage. We had to crawl gingerly over the carcass in order to push farther into the cave. It was relatively fresh (maybe a few days old) but odor had begun to kick in. Downstream of the carcass we noticed a red tinge in the water, blood was staining the stream. We had enough then, turned around and left the cave. My friend wretched once we got to the surface. We both wondered what kind kind of animal had the motivation and strength to haul a large doe up and over boulders and through a narrow entrance before stashing it. We assumed either bear or coyote and decided to come back well after the carcass would be gone. We''ve yet to return.",

    " On November 5th, 1994, I and six other cavers got together to do some ridgewalking and camping along several miles of limestone exposed on the east side of Seneca Creek, in the Seneca Creek Back Country. This is a remote and heavily forested section of the Monongahela National Forest, and lies on the western flanks of Spruce Knob, the highest point in West Virginia.<BR><BR>We planned a through hike, so I pre-positioned my vehicle down stream at the public parking area near the intersection of White''s Run and Seneca Creek. Then we drove around and upstream to the ****** trail head where we started out. Hiking along or off to the side of the trail we passed the entrances of a few caves that were located on previous trips (we''d been working this area for a few months already). The area is heavily forested with second growth hard woods that have grown up since the virgin timber was clear cut in the 1890-1912 logging era. We worked our way north toward and through a region known for a series of large, open meadows in the forest, left behind by homesteaders in the early part of the 1900s. We eventually found a number of small caves in that area, but none large enough that we could easily enter them (most would require some digging).<BR><BR>About halfway through these meadows we left the trail completely as it wandered up the mountain and away from the limestone. We continued north and across the last of the meadows, then into the trees. We crossed a couple more ravines and finally, at the end of the day, found a nice flat bench on a remote ridge to set up our camp. We were six or seven miles in from the trailhead and still had five miles to go before reaching my SUV at White''s Run. It was four miles or so as the crow flies to the nearest houses, on the far side of a big mountain. We were about as remote as you can get in that area.<BR><BR>That night we built a small fire and sat up to about 11 p.m., talking. The night was dark, clear skies but the moon had set, and not much starlight in the thick forest. We all backpack light so our light sources were no more than our head lamps and the firelight. The camp was dim. It was around 10:30 when I had just finished telling something of a spooky story. Everyone was a little keyed up I guess.<BR><BR>About 30 seconds after I finished the story, a single scream rang out from the woods behind me. It sounded to be 200 yards or more north, across the next ravine and on the next ridge we would head for the following morning. It was loud, but not incredibly so. It was unlike any cry I''d ever heard in the woods, and didn''t sound like a bird call to me. More like a mammal, reminiscent of a woman''s scream (but nothing like a cat''s scream). It started low and rose in scale, lasting about 3 to 4 seconds.<BR><BR>It really caught our attention since we were all on edge from the story I''d told. It caused a bit of nervous laughter and discussion, and some of us decided it must have been some kind of screech owl. (I''ve bought land in that area since then and hear screech owls all the time. They sound nothing like that scream.)<BR><BR>We never heard it again, and by 11 p.m. we were all sacked out. The next morning we got up and decided we had ridgewalked enough. It was Sunday and we had 5 miles of rough terrain to hike before getting to the car, then a long drive home. So we never visited the area from where this sound came. Instead we dropped down off our ridge to the trail following Seneca Creek, and back to my car.<BR><BR>I''ve not been back to that particular spot since, and would never have thought much more about it. But the event has stuck in my mind for fourteen years. When I found the BFRO website this year, read reports about screams in the night, and then noted how many sitings were occuring within a 10 mile radius of this area, I thought it might be worth mentioning. Certainly not a strong report, but possibly more evidence in the growing collection for that region of Pendleton County.",

    " Actually, I didn''t make anything of this experience until I began watching the show on OLN \"Mysterious Encounters\". That''s when the excitement of possibly having an encounter of my own hit me.<BR><BR>I was traveling up a very steep and rocky ridge about 2 hours before daylight one Saturday morning. I was packing a tree stand and my bow. It was mid-october, and daylight would bring the opening day of bow season. I was on a very rugged ridge in Pendleton county; and I had taken several deer in the area in the past. After ascending the first half of my climb, I heard russling up the ridge in front of me. I shined my small mag light in that direction. There, about maybe 60 yards in front of me were about three or four sets of (Yellow) eyes. I noticed the one set of eyes go vertically several feet, still looking in my direction. Keep in mind that our deer are about 3 feet high at the shoulders at best. Plus, the encline was about a 1:1 ratio (or steeper than the nose on most peoples faces). I also noticed that two sets of eyes were very close together, and that one of those sets of eyes didn''t loose contact with me when they run off. I kept anticipating a white tail as they moved off, or at least a snort. This is very common in our deer, even jumped up in the dark. This whole scenerio took maybe about 3 or 4 seconds. <BR><BR>About 15 to 20 seconds after they had moved off, I remember something rather heavy falling near me. I just assumed at the time that it was something falling from an oak tree or something. I now think that it was instead something thrown at me. Another very short time lapse revealed some rather peculiar \"deer vocalizations\". By this time, the creatures of source at moved across a very deep/steep hollow from me. I remember thinking to myself that those sounds couldn''t be coming from a deer or any other wild animal I have ever encountered. That included my hunting travels east and west. That''s when the cold sweat broke out on me when I heard something very similar on the T.V. show.<BR><BR>I would like to add that the area that I was in was in close proximity to where the encounters occurred at Dolly Sods. There is probably about a two thousand feet difference in elevation at where I was at; but it is only a few miles traveling across the Allegheney Mountains. <BR><BR>If these creatures are known to eat white-oak acorns and wild fox grapes, then they would have been in business at that time of year, as they were fairly plentiful in that area.<BR>I also remember the skunky smell where I think they were bedded down. Several emotions come over me now when I think about it and relive it. ",

    " It was in January 2006 when a good friend, my 26-year-old nephew and I went camping on some private land in Stokes County near Pilot Mountain. <BR><BR>This private land operates as a summer camp during the summer and hosts small retreat groups during the fall, winter and spring months. I attended this summer camp for many years as a youth and then lived and worked there during the off-season as an adult. In addition, I have been camping at this very spot a dozen times within the past few years.<BR><BR>In the summertime, the woods at night are alive with the sounds of nocturnal animals, crickets and frogs. During the winter months when all of the leaves have fallen off of the trees, the woods are dead silent at night. The only sounds you can hear are the wind and the occasional dog barking in the distance.<BR><BR>So after we set up camp, we ate dinner and sat around the campfire for a while. We climbed into the tent and went to sleep around midnight. <BR><BR>I drifted off to sleep and was awakened at about 2:30am by my nephew tossing and turning. He told me that he had indigestion from the dinner we ate and he asked if I had any antacids. He asked my friend too and we both indicated that we didnt pack any. He then said that he needed to get up and walk it off. My nephew then proceeded to unzip the tent flap and go outside by the campfire. <BR><BR>By then the fire had died out and I could hear him scratching around in the ashes looking for hot embers and cracking small sticks to build the fire again. Soon, I could see the light of the fire flickering against the side of the tent and hear the crackle and pop of burning wood.<BR><BR>It was at this time that the most unusual sound pierced the silence. <BR><BR>The sound came from the woods immediately surrounding our campsite and it could only be described as a loud yelp.  In all my years spent camping on this land, some in this very spot, I have never heard a sound like this one.<BR><BR>The souund was very similar to the yelp recorded on your website except that it was slightly higher pitch and was much closer. There wasn''t any echo.<BR><BR>Immediately after hearing this sound my eyes shot open and my nephew who was still cracking sticks around the fire froze in silence. My mind was racing to think of what could have made this sound when I heard the tent flap quickly unzip, my nephew tumble inside and then quickly zip the flap back-up again.<BR><BR>The three of us immediately whispered to each other and then lay silent. <BR><BR>The next morning and every time weve been camping since weve always had a good laugh at my nephews expense. After listening to your sound recordings, Im just in total shock at what it could have been.<BR>",

    " dear sirs,<BR>26 years ago myself, a cousin and a friend were getting ready to camp out here in a little town called mocksville nc, about 25 miles from winston salem nc.we were all teenagers enjoying the summer, after we pitched our tent, which was in a field about 200 yards from my friends house, the woods were about 100 yards away from us. As we were starting a fire, we heard something running in the woods, it was heading toward the edge of the woods at an incredible pace, when it was almost through the woods we took off running toward [friend''s] house, we were running down a old motorcycle path, it was running through the knee high weeds, it still almost caught up to us, as we looked back it was standing in the fire throwing the logs out, it was at least 8 foot tall, very hairy, we ran to [friend''s] house and told our story to his mom, now [friend''s] mom had lived on a farm her whole life and wasnt easily scared, she laughed at us, and went outside to get some clothes off the line, a few minutes later she came running in scared to death, she said she had seen something unlike anything she had ever saw, it was huge she said, looked like a monkey of some kind but big, at least 8 foot tall, all that night we could hear it circle the house, it even came onto the porch a couple of times , we were all terrified, to scared to look out, and no phone to call for help, eventually daylight came and it was gone. after we got up we looked at the edge of the woods where it had came out, the branches were broke off up to about 8 feet, after that i read every book on bigfoot. and it made sense, the strong smell of urine, which we smelled before it came out of the woods, and the figure we saw, ive never told this before except to family but it is true and i have no doubt it was bigfoot.",

    " It was a few years ago on a cold, early winter morning.  There was snow on the ground and it was freezing outside.  My mother has a habit of looking out the bathroom window early in the morning.  On this cold winter morning, with the landscaped dressed in a blanket of white and without any visible signs of being touched by human or animal footprints, she saw what looked like 3 very large humanoid footprints. It was so strange that my mother made me get up to take a look.  We put our coats on and went outside to investigate.  We couldn''t believe our eyes.  There in the snow were 3 very, very large humanoid footprints.  We couldn''t figure out where they came from or where they went.  It literally looked as it came from no where and went no where, because the footprints did not leave a trail.  The footprints were so large I could almost stand in it.  You could literally see the 5 toes with foot and toe imprints in the snow.  We couldn''t believe what we were seeing.  Who or what has a foot that big and who or what would be out in this weather barefooted.<BR><BR>",

    " I haven''t told many people about my experience because of alot of non-believers.The year was 1976, I was 15 years old. Snow was on the ground and a couple of friends and myself were snow sledding on my Dads farm. It was around 7:30 that night. We had a fire built at the bottom of the hill. We had just slid down the hill and were making our way back up the hill when we heard something making alot of noise and commotion to the right of us out beyond the light of the fire. We didn''t stay around long enough to see what it was. I ran hard as I could to the house and told my parents about what we had heard. We went back to the hill the next day to see if we could find anything. When we saw the tracks in the snow we knew what was there at the bottom of the hill that night. The tracks were at least 18 inches long and 5 or 6 inches wide. No doubt in my mind what was there that night watching us.The tracks came from out of the woods that were near by and when it left, it went back in the woods the same way that it came. We didn''t actually see the creature that night but we heard it and saw the tracks. That was almost 30 years ago and haven''t seen or heard anything since.",

    " the morning of april, 24, 2007. it was around 330-345 am. i was getting ready for work. after getting dressed, i took the dog out for his morning walk. it was a very still morning, no wind or any other noises to notice. it was unseasonably cool. the dog always has his normal routine, walk out the door, go to the edge of the driveway and use the bathroom. about the time he was making his way toward the end of the driveway he starts growling towards the treeline in front of the house. i was very attentive to him as he had never done this before. i stood there for about a minute trying to see into the darkness of the trees. as i was starting back to the house with the dog by my side. i heard a bone chilling howl and something that sounded like wood being hit on the trees. the sounds were, or it seemed only a matter of feet away. i quickly turned in the direction that i thought the sounds to be coming from and for a moment thought i caught a glimpse of something standing beside a tall tree along the treeline. i stood there for just a minute, but never noticed any more movement. after going back inside, i finished getting ready for work, went outside, as i was walking to my suv i could here twigs breaking from the footsteps. after getting into my vehicle, i put it into reverse and i could have sworn i saw something huge walk around the fenceline, up the adjoining driveway, around a pond that connects the two properties. at lunch when i returned, i noticed what looked like distured leaves on the ground in the area where i had seen and heard the thing. my dog to this day still will not go to the edge of the driveway without me. the howls sounded just like the ohio howl.",

    " This happened around 2014 in the Thickety Creek community of Montgomery County, south of the county seat of Troy. A friend at church asked me if I could come down and check his creek for gold. He knew I liked to do some gold panning as a hobby. We never settled on a day or time, I just told him I would come by one day when I got a chance. I ended up getting off work early one day and decided to run down and wash some rocks. So, I parked at his gate and grabbed my backpack at gear and walked about 200 yards from the road. To my left is the creek with about 4ft banks and a steep mountain to my right. I walked down looking for a place to easily get down into the creek without lots of brush. This area is well known for huge Timber Rattlers. <BR><BR>So I find a spot next to a huge flat rock that I end up using as a work station. After a couple hours of panning I stopped to take a break. I always freeze a 2 liter bottle of water and drink it as it melts. Im standing there drinking the water and I hear something fly through the trees above my head. My first thought was Ive never heard a bird fly through the trees and hit limbs and leaves like that! Why is it doing that? So as I stand there puzzled and confused I hear more commotion coming through the tree tops! This time my eyes focus on the sound and I see a rock about the size of a Jr sized football flying over my head and on the bank on the other side of the creek! As I stand there stunned, racking my brain try to make sense of it, I unsnap my 9mm and shout in that direction You stay over there and Ill stay over here! Needless to say I packed up and left, feeling like Im being watched the whole time! I threw my stuff in the back of my truck and hauled buggy out of there! I dont know of any animal in the woods that can throw a rock that big that far! I was so effected that I gave up gold panning and hunting for the most part! I never told the land owner or anybody else for that matter for a few years. I still dont tell many folks. I feel like I have to keep inside or people will think Im crazy. ",

This past winter I experienced the same strange occurrance on two different occasions in the same spot at a primitive campsite our group had scratched out along the Super Tree Loop in the Woodrun area of the forest.  During the wee hours of the morning in Dec. and once again in Jan. I''ve heard footsteps crunching through the heavy layer of dried leaves on the forest floor.  This \"person\" was buswhwacking and not walking along the trail.  \"It\" also came from the direction of deep woods just behind my tent and not anywhere near the main trail.  Both times it crossed over the trail and continued on bushwacking through the woods in an easterly direction.  I have to admit I was a little nervous about even moving around in my tent because I didn''t want to attract attention.  I laid there frozen both times until the thing was gone and didn''t get a look at it.  Both incidents happened on especially cold nights in Uwharrie (mid to upper teens).  Hunting season was long over as well.  Whatever it was did not use a flashlight and walked through the dense woods of this area smoothly without missing a step.  The last thing I expected to see was a person out there in that weather at that time of the night with no flashlight.  On another occasion in Jan. My co-leader had the exact same experience.  He never looked to see what it was either.  ",

    " it.started about june of 1997 with a loud wistleing at night.i kept trying to figure out what kind of bird or animal was i have never heard anythang like this before.shortly after i started hearing the noises at night i found some strange feces at the edge of the woods about 100 yds or so from my house .i have never seen any like it before. it looked sort of human but i could tell what ever it was it had ben eating leaves and grass. idont remember quite but it was about aug or sept the whistleing stoped.i figured what ever it was had gone. in oct two of my brothers came over and we went squirrel hunting.on the way back to the house we walked close to the area where i saw the feces. one of my went one way and me and my brother made circle came back around and met our other brother.when we got back around to where he was he came running up to us all excited saying did you see that did you see that i said no i didnt see anything. he said it must have ran rite by you. i ask him again. what did he see. he said i dont know it was gray and ijust saw back of this thing. he said it didnt a deer or dog or any animal. after that i didnt think much.but about 1 month later i dont remember the date but it was november 3;oo in the afternoon i looked out the upstairs of my house and mabey a little over 100yds away at about the spot where i saw the feces i saw these two cretures they were gray. they were standing side by side sort of swaying back and forth.i watched for about 10 sec. and then i done someing i souldnt have done i ran down stairs as fast as i could to try and get a better look. when i got out the back door they were gone. its hard to say how tall they were mabey 5 ft mabey 6 ft. they were taller than any 4 legged wild animals that lives around here.that was the last i have or heard from these things. some time after it was all over i remembered something that happened before all this started. i am not sure but i thank it was in the spring of 97 just through the woods a short ways from where the feces was there was an old barbed wire fince. in the top strand of this about 4 ft off the ground was some long gray hair. it was about 4 mabey 5 in of hair on each side of the barb. and i remember thinking at the time what kind of animal around here has hair like this. 1997",

    " It was the first week of December 2002. I was camping with my friend [edited], in Macon County, North Carolina.<BR><BR>We had been there 2 days. We decided to take one of our usual late night walks. Because of the weather we were one of only three sites occupied. There was an icestorm on the way and we were planning to leave early the next morning. We had crossed the river and walked about 200 yards to the gates when we were startled by a scream that made the hair on my neck stand up. <BR><BR>I have spent my entire life in the outdoors, much of it in wilderness areas and I have never heard anything like this in my life.  I was carrying my sidearm and immediately drew it and aimed my maglite in the direction of the scream. The next thing we knew,several rocks were thrown in our direction. TO say we were frightened would be an understatement. We went back to camp and left early the next morning.

    " I was about ten or eleven years old. I was traveling with my mom and younger brother in a car on a rural road near Rocky Mount, N.C. in 1979. It was at night. We spotted a tall hairy figure crossing the road ahead of us. It was close enough to see in the headlights. (I am remembering all of this through a child''s eyes but my mom remembers the same accounts). We slowed down, almost to a complete stop because the figure stopped right in the middle of the road. It turned and looked at us with it''s body still facing in the direction it was originally headed. It was extremely tall, had hair all over it''s body and it''s arms were really long. It suddenly ran with super fast speed and jumped the ditch and was gone. It was like nother I had ever seen before or have seen since. I have been an avid outdoorsman...I hunt and fish and camp all over NC, SC & VA. I have seen bears in their natural invironments. I have seen them stand to look at me and then run away, but they always go back down to all fours to do that. I am convinced that what I saw as a child was in fact, a Bigfoot or sasquatch.<BR>Not only that, but a cousin of mine was driving near the same area in which we saw the Bigfoot about ten years ago. Which would be about twenty years after our sighting. I had never told him of our encounter. He was driving alone and at night and had almost the same sighting that we had had years earlier. He was terrified and when he got home told his mom about it while almost being in tears. She reluctantly told me about it after it happened a few days later, thinking I would laugh at was he had told her. I told her that I completely believed what he had seen!  ",

    " Date: Oct. 2000. Location, lower Sol Duc River, FS Marker D2000, north of Hwy 110. <BR><BR>This event happened during one of my many fishing trips to the Olympic Penninsula.<BR><BR>I traveled this forest service road D2000. This is an off road private forest area owned by Rayonier. I fished the first turn out many times. Often at the first turn out, which is pretty isolated, I would hear big thuds when I would be outside my vehicle working on my fishing setup. It sounded like a huge rock bouncing back and forth, starting slow and then speeding up only to then abruptly stop. If I could describe it, I would say it went, Thud (2 seconds pass), then Thud (two more seconds would pass) then the thuds went quicker. Overall, it was Thud...Thud...Thud.Thud.Thud.Thud.Thud. Then it was silent. I thought it was odd, but I was armed with my Colt .45 and fearless. I was alone as I often was in those days. So that day I decided to go further down the trail, proud of my 4x4 and it''s capabilities I reached the end of the road that had a 4x4 trail that ultimately ended near the river. When I fish I''m stealthy. I''m real silent when I approach the river. So after I parked and walked down to the river I started casting. I fealt kind of odd and frightened and I shrugged it off as just being alone in the woods. <BR><BR>After my second cast I decided to have a cigarette. Dang nicotine! As soon as I used my lighter I heard a large crack in the bushes across the river from me. This was probably a distance of 40 feet. I looked up, startled to see the thick bushes moving alot across the river, but not too worried because I had the river as a safety buffer. It was thick brush and I thought it was an animal sleeping in the bushes. I saw a big brown figure moving in the bushes but I couldn''t make out any details. The bank where the bushes were had a slope above it that was probably a 30 degree angle. This posed an uphill path for the figure in the bushes. Then, the next thing I know I see a tree, in the brush, probably two feet in width (not too big, but not too small)that suddently cracked and fell up the hill! It was apparent that whatever I saw had run into the tree, probably startled by my presence because about 10 feet away from that tree was another tree, that cracked and fell up the hill in the path of the brown creature hastly departing the bushes.<BR><BR>After that, the creature was gone into the deep brush and forest adjacent to the river.<BR><BR>I was convinced this was Bigfoot. Never in my life had I experienced a tree cracking and falling up hill or the sight of something that large that had moved so quickly.<BR><BR>I immediately pulled out my gun and ran back to the truck. I drove very quickly out of the area with my heart racing.<BR>",

Anyway, we got to the spot at about 6:00am still dark, we sat in the truck till it got light enough to see better. We were at the start of the spur truck not running, windows down. We were talkin when I noticed a loud sound on my side of the road, it was stick beating. <BR><BR>There were loud 7 slams in a row. It stoped for maybe 5 seconds  then 7 more from further off in the distance. This went on for aprox 8 minutes. I asked my buddy if he was hearing it and he said yes but he thought it was just a hunter trying to spook up deer. <BR><BR>I don''t think so ...  why would somebody do that back in the woods an hour and a half before daylight? <BR><BR>At one point later on a low bed truck came down the road, most likely to pick logging epuipment. When the truck got closer the driver of the truck stopped, then quickly shined a spotlight in the timber around where we heared the beating. He then took off grabing the gears fast (I know because I drive a log truck too.) <BR><BR>The stickbeating stopped after that. However, when we did hear the beating, they were very hard and heavy bangs. I''m 6''2\" 250 lbs and I tried to make the same sound, to describe to my brother in law what I heard.

    " September 14<BR>My adult son, daughter and her son and I all hiked into Twin Sisters Lakes from the Deep Creek Campground around 1 1/2 to 2 miles. My son and were planning to spend 2 nights and daughter and her son, just for the day. We set up camp, ate lunch and just enjoyed the day at the lake and surrounding area. Many hunters were leaving due to it being the last day of Bow season for Elk so we watched them being packed out by Mules and Horses. <BR>Beautiful day in the low 80''s I would say. My daughter and her son left around 3:30 so it was just my son and I and the 2 dogs. He fly fished and I just relaxed and read at camp.<BR>At dusk we started a fire, ate and had a glass of wine.  I did a couple wood knocks but did not hear a response. Around 9:00 we went to our tents with a dog in each for the night. At 1:30 in the morning the dogs needed out to do their business so we did also then back to bed. My son snores terribly so my sleeping was intermittent. Our tents were between two trees about 8 feet apart and a foot from each other and the trees. I awoke sometime in the night and raised up because I heard the dog moving around. He was staring out the window towards the Lake. He did this several times that night, didn''t bark or growl. I heard nothing that night except my son and the dogs snoring.<BR><BR>September 15<BR>Awoke early and we decided to take a hike to Blankenship Lakes and Meadow. Spooked a Rough Grouse on the way and met 2 Bow Hunters on the trail. They had no luck but said where they were camped at Blankenship was busy with coyotes during the previous night. When we reached the Lake one of the dogs Maggie would not leave Bob''s side so we continued on. Got back to camp around noon.<BR>When dusk arrived we made a fire and I decided to do a call, one loud Whoop and immediately across the lake we got a return whoop and Elk on both sides of the lake started bugling back and forth to each other. Also a coyote yip then it was quiet for awhile and then more Elk bugles and a loud knock on the hill behind our tents.<BR>By this time my son was wide eyed and couldn''t believe what he was hearing. I had told him of all of my expeditions and reports from others so he was a believer but had never experienced it for himself. We decided to go to bed and he immediately went to sleep snoring right away. I on the other hand was awake and listening when I felt something heavy stepping on the side of my tent where my arm was lying , I slowly moved my arm not making a sound because I didn''t want whatever it was to know I wasn''t sleeping. I felt my head being pushed down also as it went by and a loud swoosh on the tent fly. I was petrified and tried to call out \"Go Away\" but nothing came out. I was mute, but continued to try and say something to wake my son up. He and both dogs were snoring. After it passed my tent I continued to hear soft bipedal footfalls around our camp. I did not sleep all night. Around dawn I heard another wood knock. We got up , packed up and left. Very memorable trip for us, shook me up but I still want to have a sighting and will keep doing this.<BR><BR>Note: Actual names edited by the investigator in order to protect the identity and privacy of the witnesses.

    " One morninig after leaving the camp ground in the national forrest to get a biscuit me and my father saw something big walking across the road.<BR>I couldnt identyfi it. it was walking then stoped looked at us real fast and steped off the road into the woods. their was a road sign when this thing walked in front of it it completly blocked out the sign. I asked my dad if he had seen what I had seen and he said yes. Isaid thank god I thought I was going crazy or something. We pulled up to where the thing steped off the road and looked around nothing nothing at all the brush which this thing had went throught was not even moving. we got back in the truck and started driving my dad said what in the world was that. We tried to rule out every other possiblity but big foot but they didnt work out to good. First Isaid it could have been a bear or some one riding a horse. But my dad said if it was a bear it wouldnt be walking upright unlees it was thratened or try ing to reach for food and it wasent presnt,and bears arent around the stanley county area.Then my dad said maybe it was a horse because there are horse riding trailand a horse camp in the national forrest,But theres one problem Something as big as a horse or a bear should have upset the brush and it should have been moving but it wasnt. Some thing very fast and very smart had to have steped over te brush. After all this did only happen in 30 secs while we drove down the road. And Iprety much Agree with my dad. Thanks for your time. Ps I couldnt spell the name of the national forrest its one of those native american words I always have troble with those.",

    " I live on 1010 Highway near the Johnston County Airport. Its kind of a country road , couple swampy areas and such, a good hunting area you could say. I was on my way back from the beach at my dad''s house, my sister was with me. I''m 24 she''s only 15. Anyway, I just turned out of the local BBQ place for some food (White Swan open 24 hrs) to head home. I got past the local livestock building, and turned onto 210 Hwy, drove about 3-4 minutes, turned onto 1010 or Cleveland Rd. There was an old car parked on the side of the road, so I could hardly see to turn left, so when I did, I drove for maybe 10-15 seconds when I saw eyes in front of me (it was about 9:15 in the PM) I turned lights on bright and I thought it was a homeless man walking along the road, but seeing someone walking down here when its dark is unlikey, I slow down ,I didn''t know if it was gonna cross the road , I was driving about 35  in a 45 mph zone. As I got closer I noticed it was not a man, it was something else, like a bear walked up right with long legs and arms longer than a man, had dark hair, I couldn''t really see the color very well. He was about as big as my grandfather and he is 6'' 11'''' . I was speechless, and my sister was scared to death because our house is 1 minute from where he was at. That night I couldn''t sleep and the next morning I got up and went back there, no foot prints or anything because it is so dry here from no rain.I haven''t seen it since but it''s only been a few days ",

I threw my headlights on bright and turned the wheel to the left and drove streight to it. I was sideways in  the road. As I neared it I stopped and I had a clear view of it.  It was so tall that I had to lean closer to the steering wheel to look up into its face.  I could see him (clearly a male) from just above his knees to the top of his head.  I looked streight into his eyes.  He seemed to be comunicating with me though his eyes.  He let me get a good look at him and then he gave a nod and I knew I was to go. He was at least 7ft tall or more with silver and black hair some of it at least 4 to 5 inches long and dark outdoors type skin (where it was exposed. His eyes resembled that of a dogs and were the color of a alaskain husky and wide flat nose and a wide thin mouth like a mans. He never opend his mouth. Just stood there and looked at me and blinked some and make jesters with his head and eyes. When he knodded at me I knew it was time to leave so I turned the steering wheel very slowly ( I felt dazed) and drove on down the road.  I estimated the time I set there about 15 to 20 mnutes.

    " Last  September a friend and I went to scout a place to deerhunt up close to the Pee Dee River.I am disabled from a heavy equipment accident and i needed to kill deer to feed my son and me so we were trying to find a place that i could hunt and be comfortable and not too hard for me to access.We noticed a strong smell and my friend has hunted this place 30 years and i ask him if he had ever smelled anything like it and he said no.Opening day of regular gun season on October I parked my truck at the gate and my friend went by boat to his stand.As I was going in I noticed that stinking smell again as I got to my stand it sounded like something was following me the whole time on the way in there and it sounded like someone hitting trees with baseball bats.I hunted there everyday a lot of times by myself one day going to my stand I saw one just one track about 23 inches long and it was compacted in the ground about 2 inches I weigh 300 lbs. and my track only went down about half an inch. I contacted John Shaw with the N.C Wildlife Resource Commision he a Biologist he came down and met me and i showed him the track he said he could see what i was saying but the track was contaminated so we left it at that. About 2 weeks later i was hunting a stream right down from this spot and heard a huge splash in the water and i thought it was a deer so i waited,but never saw anything about 20 minutes later I went up the creek a few hundred feet and in a place in the creek I saw 1 track again on a rock bottom creek very hard my track didn''t show up when i crossed the creek but this track 20 plus inches was down about an inch into the hard rockbed bottom of the creek since it was only one track again I didn''t bother calling the biologist back,but i saw other signs like stick formations,large patches of vegetation that looked like it had been rolled over by a steam roller,several tracks in the leaves with long strides about 4 feet,found where 2 animals had been killed looked like something put a deer up on a big limb about 8 feet of the ground you coud see the deer hide all over the limb and found where an animal had just been freshly killed one day hunting in there was only person up there that day and something killed an animal near the river it looked like a pile of manure had been steamed rolled into about a four foot wide area on the road about eight feet long and a lot of blood on the ground but no guts and no corpse and that strange smell was there every day.I have hunted a lot of places since i was 5 years old I am 44 now,but this is the only place i have ever hunted that gives me the creeps,I know of a few sighting close to this place,it''s not far from the highway 220 incident yall reported and not too far from where the one in Montgomery county was spotted.I don''t care to be interviewed by the media please but i believe I can show you where you can actually find Bigfoot ",

I followed it with my eyes and as the sun reached in front of my tree stand a small, 3 ft., black, furry creature reared up from a sleeping position and ran away from the sun. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up!!! I don''t know what it was. I have been hunting since I was 15 and have seen plenty of wild life in my time. I had a 30-06 semi-auto rifle and I was frozen stiff. Needless to say, I got the hell out of there and never went back. After all of these years, I now believe it was a \"child\" bigfoot.",

    " I was spending the night at a friends house, after a day''s hunting in the nearby woodlands and swamps. It was about 3:00am in the morning, when I awoke to a ''howling'', or ''wailing'' sound  just outside the house, coming from the direction of the woods. This lasted for probably 30 seconds to a minute. My buddy, sleeping on the floor a few feet away, was not awakened by the sound. I was frightened, so I did not get up to investigate. It took my at least an hour to fall back asleep. <BR><BR>I never associated this sound with ''bigfoot'', until now. I downloaded the \"Howl.wav\" (http://BFRO.net/AVEVID/MJM/ohsket.htm) file from your web site. It has a eerie howling sound, with dogs obviously reacting to the noise. I had chills when I heard this, because it was very similar, if not identical to the sound I had heard that early morning. I have played it over and over again. <BR><BR>I am a hunter and outdoors man, and I had never heard an animal make this sound before. It was definitely ''organic'' in origin. I never thought about Bigfoot living in this part of the state, because the surrounding areas are somewhat populated. There are, however, lots of rural swamp lands and forest areas. <BR><BR>Although I have no further evidence to back up my claims, I thought this would be worthy to report. I''d be interested to know if Bigfoot really could exist in a coastal woodlands area, rather than the mountainous regions that the creature is normally associated with. ",

    " In early October 1983 I was recently married and stationed at Camp Lejeune, NC.  Neither my wife nor I had ever been to Wilmington, NC before so one Saturday we made a day trip to Wilmington.  We saw some sites, did some shopping, had dinner and went to a late movie.<BR><BR>While driving back to Camp Lejuene on US-17, just north of the town of Holly Ridge I noticed a very large figure on the right shoulder ahead.  It was walking upright and I assumed it was a bear. I slowed down in order to avoid hitting it should it go down on all four legs and flee.  I was going perhaps 10 MPH or a bit less when I finally realized that what I was approaching was not a bear.  The creature I saw was massive; maybe 7 to 8 feet tall and I''d estimate 600 Lbs or more.  The hair was a lighter brownish color and appeared long in its length.  I could see its face very clearly.  <BR><BR>What struck me at the time and even to this day is that the creature appeared to be oblivious to his surroundings and seemed deep in thought.  It never gave any indication that he was aware of the car approaching nor did the bright headlights seem to cause it discomfort.  It just kept moving along at a slow pace looking straight ahead.  I finally passed the creature at nearly walking speed.  I assumed I had to have been mistaken or could not have seen what I thought I had so I stopped the car.  I looked back out the rear window and could see the creature still walking southbound in the glow of the stop lamps of the car.<BR><BR>I woke up my wife and had her look.  She did look but said it must have been a bear.  At that point I let it go and resumed my northbound trip back to Jacksonville.<BR><BR>One other thing to note is that my impression was that the creature was clean in the sense that its hair was not matted nor in tuffs.  The hair was straight and laid flat against its body and seemed to vary in length from a couple inches to maybe 5 inches.  There was no hair on the face which was a bit lighter in complexion than the fur surrounding it.",

    " I have never told this to anyone because I didn''t want to hear the jokes, but it was mid July 1987.  I was heading toward the beach in my sports car, top down music blasting.  It was around 8:45 pm so it was still light, sort of dusk dark.  I had my headlights on cruising about 60 mph  when I rounded a corner and there in the road stood this large hairy thing.   I slammed on brakes and swerved around it, but I must have glanced it because it bounced over the passenger side of my car.   I slid the car around and stopped where my headlights were about halfway on the thing.   It got up and came at me.  I was about 25 feet away from the thing and the smell was horrible. It hung in the air like a wet blanket.   It was about 7 to 7.5 feet high, reddishbrown matted looking hair,  its face was hairless and he looked ticked.   I put the car in reverse, backed up and threw the car in drive and took off.  As I was spinning around I looked in the rearview mirror and it was right on my cars rear end.  I heard a loud bang. About that time my car caught traction and took off.  I left the creature running down the road after me.  I have never been so scared in all my life.  After I got to my destination I checked my car.  The passenger rear quarter panel  was dented in with hair on it.  And my rear spoiler was shattered where he had hit the rear of my car.    I told my friends, family, police and insurance that I had hit a stray cow.  But it took weeks to get that smell off of the outside of my car and the inside still had that smell.   It was a under smell, like sewage and something else.  I was 27 then, I''m 38 now.  I have not been down that road since.   I will drive 45 to 50 miles out of my way not to go that route.",

    " I experienced this incident while living on a military base in North Carolina.  I was approximately 14 or 15 years old at the time, I am fifty now, however the incident is still fresh in my mind.  At that time there was nothing for a young boy to do so my favorite pastime was wandering the military reservation and search for discarded C rations as we never had enough to eat in the house.There was 8 people in my family.  One day I had skipped school to go C ration hunting.  I never will forget that day, it was very warm and sunny, which for North Carolina is not unusual for a fall day.  We used to call it indian summer.  I had been wandering the deeper recesses of the reservation and was quite proud of the fact that not only had I stumbled across old farmsteads that the Marine corps had condemed in order to take the land but had a pretty good supply of discarded C rations.  Realizing it was getting late and I had better get home, I hit a tank trail made by the marines for thier vehicles to use.  I was getting closer to home so I decided to leave the trail and short cut it through the woods.  I knew this particular area and always avoided it because it was known as a pocosin, which in local terms meant an area that is real dense and swampy.  As I made my way in to the pocosin something really seemed out of the ordinary, all day I was used to hearing the sounds of the forest, birds, frogs squirrels chattering and what was great not seeing another human being. Now it was so quiet it didn''t seem natural.  Something made me stop and to this very day I am perplexed about this I don''t know why because at that age you have no fear as you think you are going to live forever.  I had no fear this time either however I felt that I was being watched.  I have never had this feeling again.  I slowly started to turn my head to the right when I caught a glimpse of brown.  My first thought was oh its only a deer.  I stood stock still and kept looking at the brown patch and it didnt move.  It was in a VERY dense part of the pocosin and my second thought was maybe its not a deer but possibly a discarded marine corps field jacket.  Now that would be a treasure, as I started to go towards the object I seem to hear the crashing of brush first then that brown patch moved, only it moved higher.  I  estimate a height of between 8 and 10 feet.  As it grew in height it also grew broader exposing more of itself.  I never saw its head or any real features other than the long fur because that thing was moving so fast through that pocosin that I was amazed how any animal that size could do that.  The crashing of the branches and underbrush was loud and I all I could do was stand there.  I don''t know how long I remained in that position, all I rememeber is the sounds of the forest returned and thats what snapped me back to the present.  I have only recalled this story once and was told never again to repeat it to anyone or go back in those woods.  I have never returned to that area.",

    "Around the same time frame I''ve had several occurances at my residence. There were 2 large Forest fires in the area. The first incident was in my garden. I have 2 massive garden areas, a mulch pile and compost piles. My mulch piles were ripped apart. The fish carcasses were gone and the melons had been bitten in half. All his vegetables in the garden were stomped down. I found 2 sets of foot prints; one was very large and its stride was approximately the size of a large man in full splits. The second set was smaller the size of a girls foot print. One week ago my dog; a rat terrier, started growling and its hair was bristled and would not come out of the closet. This happened once before. My dog has chased bears, but whatever was outside scared my dog. Last Wednesday (Aug. 10, 2011) my dog woke me up again growling and in the closet and at that point something bumped against the trailer and shook it. Also the next morning (Aug. 11, 2011) I noticed my 5gal. barrel had been moved from the front of the trailer to the backyard. It had water and shrimp hulls in it. It had been dumped out and the shrimp hulls were gone. Not just turned over, but like some one picked it up and turned it over. This Wednesday (Aug. 71, 2011) at approximately 2:30am I had gotten home from work and stepped out on his porch to smoke a cigarette and heard something howling for about 10 seconds; then stop and start up again. It went from low to high pitch howl. The sound came from the NW direction the same direction I saw the creature on Monday. One more thing; I have several deer, an opossum and raccoons that would visit my yard, but in the last 2 to 3 weeks all the animals have disappeared; especially the deer. No one around his area have seen any deer lately. No road kills; nothing.",

The road was straight for 3 miles, it has forest on one side and swamp land on the other side.  Approximately 5/10ths of a mile South of Harris Road on Highway 53 a bipedal creature bolted in front of my cab less than 50 feet ahead of the cab''s headlights.  The creature was at a dead run and didn''t look towards the cab.  The creature was a crimson rusty brown in color with matted hair, very muscular, 6 1/2 to 7 feet tall and approximately 400lbs.  The arm facing the cab headlights hung knee length or longer, had human hands and black fingernails.  The creature took about 4 strides to cross the highway.  It seemed to have no neck just a head; sort of like a caveman.  Another vehicle was behind me and traveling very fast, but slowed way down when the creature appeared on the road.  That car was approximately 1/10th of a mile behind my cab.  ",

    " I was deer hunting off of Highway 24 near Rhodestown, NC, right outside of Jacksonville, NC. I had been in my stand since about three that afternoon. It was close to dark and I saw a deer walking along the edge of the clearing I was in. It kept looking into the woods like it was curious of something. The deer got closer and I took the shot. When I did, it took off running and hit some brush and fell down. I waited about 30 minutes and it got dark. I got out of my stand and went to get the deer. I got my things together and started dragging my deer to my truck that was about a quarter of a mile through a thick part of the woods I was hunting in. I was carrying my rifle, backpack, the deer, and a flashlight in my mouth. So I could pull the deer by its leg, and hold my rifle and backpack straps. After walking through the thick part of the woods, it was a straight shot to my truck. I dropped the deers leg to get situated and get myself altogether to continue my walk out, when I looked up with my light still in my mouth. I saw two eyes looking back at me. They looked wider than any animal I had ever seen at night. I have been hunting all my life. I have seen everything from deer to coyote to bear. These set of eyes were about my height, I am 5'' 10\". The trail I was on slightly went down hill. It stared at me long enough for me to put my rifle and backpack down. I had a 9mm Glock with me and I pulled it out, I shot once into the ground next to me to get whatever it was to get out of the trail I was on. It did not move or flinch, it just simply looked to its left and looked back at me. I looked down to take a knee, because I was getting worried. I got on my knee, looked back up, and it walked off to it''s left, into some of the thickest woods I have seen. I grabbed the deer and continued dragging it towards my truck. When I got to the spot where I thought I saw the eyes, I looked to both sides of the trail and I could smell a musky foul odor, and where it had walked off the trail, tree limbs and trees were pushed over as if something huge had just barged through the thicket. I went to my truck, cleaned the deer out there in the woods. Like another post on here that I read, I felt like I was watched the whole time I was cleaning the deer. I left the rib cage and spine of the deer I cleaned out there, along with the hide. When I came back to the same spot, the spine had been drug off about 300 yards from where I left it. It was one of the strangest and creepiest nights I have ever had in the woods by myself. ",

    " I have always wanted to tell this story to someone and after reading report #1939 I finally have the nerve to tell it. I live in Carteret county and at the time worked in Sneads Ferry (Onslow County) and the commute to work everyday took me through camp LeJeune via the back gate. As I made the turn onto Hwy. 17 off of Hwy. 172 I noticed what I thought was a bear sitting  down under a huge pecan tree on the right. Since there was about 50 or 60 feet distance between me & \"the bear\" I decided to pull of to the side of the road & watch him for a minute. It was a warm July morning & I had the windows of my truck rolled down as usual and noticed the most ungodly smell I had ever experienced. It was kinda like rotten eggs mixed with sewage & sulfur. As I sat & watched I quickly realized that this was no bear as the creature stood up from the croutched position walked over to the pecan tree & began shaking it.<BR><BR>I was floored by what I was watching. Understand that this tree is immense & the creature had no problem shaking the pecans from it. Pecans that are still in the green hulls by the way. I wanted a better look at it since the whole sighting was with it''s back to me so I put the truck in 1st gear (ready to bug out if need be)  & blowed the horn. It suddenly stopped & just completely froze still with it''s back to me. it stayed like that til I layed down on the horn about 10 seconds later & it slowly turned & looked right at me. Thats when my heart decided to do the 50 yard dash in 2.3 seconds. I couldn''t see it''s face that well but it stood about 8 - 10 ft. Tall & it''s hair was very long & matty. It stared at me for what seemed an eternity & made a loud screaching noise & tore off into the woods. The sprint from the tree to the woods was about 30 yards or so & it took him no time to reach them. I''m talking split seconds!<BR><BR>On my way home that day I decided to stop again and though the creature was gone I could still smell that ungodly mix of stinch. To this day when I pass by that pecan tree my heart races.",

    " The only thing about my sighting Im not 100% sure of is the month. and distances and Heights but I feel Im pretty close.  <BR><BR>On or around July or August of 1992 I was working at a Chinese Restaurant in town. I was supposed to be heading for work, but had made my mind up earlier that I was going to layout. So that I   wouldnt be caught by my Grandparents and or Father for being a slacker I needed a place to hide/something to do. Well not having any money I chose a place that A. gave me cover and B. gave me a place to kick around and explore. Near where we use to live (and still near today) near the Yadkin River they use to hold Tractor pulls, singings (John Anderson sang there once before he made it big) etc. It had gone out of business quite a few years back but there were still some dilapidated buildings still standing and some bleachers. I parked my car underneath the bridges that the interstate ran across and hopped over the DO NOT ENTER signed cable barrier. I followed the dirt path that led to the remains of what was once called The River Run. The path ran parallel to the river, but turned away from it roughly two hundred yards from where I hopped the cable. I reached the Remains and kicked around, I looked in the old Bathrooms (basically a Pee stall) checked under the bleachers for change or dollar bills that may still be there, of course there wasnt any. And little did I know before I got there that a crane they had recently (couple months) been using to dig out sand from the river (for what I do not know) was still there. I of course looked it over, crawled in the cab, looked for keys etc. Well, not only was I getting BORED quickly, it was getting hot. It was a hot summer and having been indoors WORKING, like a good boy the whole summer until then, I hadnt realized how hot it got at around 11:00 am. So I decide that there had to be a better place to chill. I headed back down dirt path. The areas that the Buildings were located were Roughly one hundred and fifty yards away from the river. As I was heading back I noticed something that appeared to be sitting on the riverbank; I first assumed it was a dog. I whistled, yelled here Boy and all that and it didnt respond. As I got closer I realized it wasnt a dog and felt stupid, cause there were weeds and such growing at the bank and I just figured I was Whistling for WEEDS to come to me. As I got closer and closer it appeared to be a very Unkempt, long haired hippy of a man. But the Funny thing was I could only see the Bust of him (chest to top of head) so then I just assumed it was a Bum standing on a ledge in the river looking over the bank watching me. So I kept walking, actually strutting to let this Bum know if he tried to mess with me, he was going to get his ars whipped, but good. As I kept walking and not paying any attention to the Bum a strange sensation came over me (to this day I cant explain it) I looked up and thats when I realized it wasnt a bum, it was something else, what, I do not know but it wasnt human. At this point I was roughly 50 yards away, my mind was racing and my heart was beating, here I was almost face to face with a Big foot? So I did the only rational thing I could think of at the time, I ran towards. I know that, that doesnt seem to be the brightest thing to have done BUT in my mind and with the MILLION things running through it the one thing that didnt go through my mind was fear, NOT one ounce. UntilI was, at this point, roughly forty yards away and the closer I got, the doubts, if any that this THING was not human was completely gone. At about some thirty yards away I took my eye of it for just and I mean JUST a split second and it was gone and that is when fear struck me. I halted quickly. I dare say now I was 25 yards away from where IT was. I was petrified, I stood there for what seemed like hours, while I was standing there it was the first time that I really had the chance to reflect on what I just saw, and all I can remember thinking was. A. Why did it look like Chewbacca from Star Wars minus the black nose? B. Why did it have very light fur almost dirty strawberry blonde? C. Why no smell, dont they always stink? D.Why did I wuss out and get scared? I finally Talked myself out of being a big wimp and decided that if it was what I think it was I need proof. I BABY stepped looking left and right as quickly as my neck could turn the whole time I was walking to the river bank. I reached the River bank and scanned the River and River bank like my life depended on it. I roughly stood there for 15 minutes looking at the Highest point to where IT could have been standing looking over the River bank at me. I looked for tracks but all I found was sand slid into the river, I looked for hair and nothing. I even sniffed around and couldnt smell anything but what smelt like fish. I then jumped to the highest point  to try a gauge how tall IT was. Im 62 and have a reach of 76 and I had to bounce a little (not a hard jump) but bounce nonetheless for the tips of my fingers to be even with the River bank from the highest point IT could have possibly be standing.  I know I had to bounce at least 6 inches(any more and Im sure I would have slid into the water, so that puts the river bank height roughly 8 feet  and I was seeing ITS Bust so IT was (and its a guess) roughly 93 95 or more . I finally climbed out of the riverbank, walked to my car peering and alert to anything jumping out, but nothing eventful happened. Got in my car drove home, no one ever asked me if I laid out of work cause no one EVEN NOTICED!!! Needless to say I never laid out of work again., well not  without a good reason. <BR>",

These tracks were seen within a 2 mile radius in the northern mountains of North Carolina in a town called Glendale Springs, off the Blue Ridge Parkway. They were observed by several individuals including park rangers. Photos were taken by a resident of the town. These tracks seemed to cross over a split rail fence in one stride.

I think that this creature was probably searching for food in the deepest snow in these mountains in several years.<BR>",

    " On Sept. 9th I took my seven year old son trout fishing after school, around 4:00 in the evening. We had fished for probably an hour with no luck at this one big long hole with the front of the hole water moves swift and is 5 to 6 ft. deep. The back of the hole is shallow and slow moving about 15 or 20 ft across. So we decided to fish down to the next pot hole, and as we walked beside the creek I noticed across the creek there is sort of like sand bar where the water has eroded it off to a drop off not like a flat beach. In the sand bar I noticed the sand had been walked in and the sand had fallen of in the creek like an animal had forded the creek their.  On our side of the creek the bank is very very rocky with a lot of big rocks as big as cars and smaller line the creek and the surrounding area . About 15 ft below the sand bar on our side I was walking across some of these big rocks to fish this next hole.When I looked between the rocks and saw one BIG foot print in the wet creek bank sand. I dropped down in  between the rocks to look close at it .I am convinced that is was to wide to be a man or woman''s . I put my boot beside it and I wear a size 10 an a half and this was probably a 15 0r 16 and and about 2 inches wider than my boot. It had undoubtedly crossed the river from the sand bar to this spot. The other side of the creek is rock cliffs an straight up no way to explore any direction.",

    " While on vacation, my family and I were camping at Linville trailer lodge and campground in Linville North Carolina. On June 15th, 2010 we were all sleeping in our pop up camper. At 2:00 am I was woke up by the sound of an animal to the south east of our camper. Its calls were 4 short whoops followed by 1 double whoop. After listening to that for a couple of minutes I heard another one calling from the North West. Its call was 3 short whoops followed by a double whoop. While listening to that one, another from the North West started calling. Its calls were 2 short whoops followed by a double whoop. After a couple of minutes I could hear them calling and moving towards the north east. It sounded like they were with in 100 yards of our camper but I was the only one that got woke up. On June 17th we got ready for bed about 9:00 pm. around 9:30 pm I could hear the same calls as the second and third animals from 2 nights before, they were much further away this time. My 8 yr old daughter heard them also and asked what kind of animal makes that sound? I did not answer her. After we got home I got onto your web sight and played the whoops and knocks from the Sierra Nevada Mountains, my daughter came running from her bed room and said that is what I heard the other day.

    " I was sitting at Popular Crove Church waiting on my girlfriends parents to go to work so I could see her. I started walking up the dirt road then I cut up on Roten Creek Road still walking on a dirt road. When I was walking I had a funny feeling and the hair on my neck and arms stood up. I passed by a local old lady''s house, and saw car lights coming down the road from a distance so I ran down, to my left, and into the corn field. I squatted down and was waiting for the set of lights to come down the road, and as they passed, I saw another set of lights coming down the road, which was my girlfriends parents leaving.<BR><BR>I was still squatting when I smelt a sudden (bad) odor (like mildew). I looked to the left then I looked to the right and I didn''t see anything til I looked directly behind me. At the edge of the mountain where the cornfield began, there Bigfoot stood about 30 to 40 feet away from me.<BR><BR>He was starring at me with big dark eyes. He had an oval pointed head. I''d say about 6-8 foot tall and as wide as a refrigerator. His arms were down beside him. He had big fingers, and hair 4 or 5 inches long all over his body. He had a bow in his back. He just stood there. He didn''t show any teeth or anything. I remember trying to get my legs to start running but it was like I was frozen.<BR><BR>It took me about 10 seconds to start running (NOTE: there was lights coming down the dirt road the whole time all of this was going on but we were both out of sight.) I started running. I ran into a barb wire fence getting to the road, then went running up the road hollering. I told my girlfriend about it and told her not to tell anybody.

On October 18th 2013 around 5:45 pm, I left to meet her and her nephews to take them to a Haunted Trail (For Halloween) after she got off of work.

About 30 seconds after I pulled out of the driveway, onto the road, I looked into an open field on the left, they sell muscadine grapes (there is a dirt road that leads into the vineyard area) and about 30-40 yards off the road, and about 15 yards off of the dirt road/path there what at the time was a bear sitting on its butt, I saw it only for about 4 seconds while passing. I got down the road about 1/8 mile and turned around in a local church parking lot, when I got back, there was another vehicle turned into the dirt path, I slowed down and rolled my windows down, and the lady asked me \"Do you see that thing?\" which I didn''t see it anymore, she then pointed, I looked, and it was walking on two legs into the tree line. We then spoke for a few more minutes, before I left. I told her I turned around to get another look. I knew then it was not a bear after I saw it walking on two legs like a human.

    " I live near Asheville NC. I own a landscaping & Irrigation company. I grew up about an hour east. My parents had 30 acres that was surrounded by 6,000 acres of game land. I''ve played in the woods, hunted, and camped my whole life. Plus my business also allows me to be outside year round. <BR><BR>I was starting up a irrigation system in a large gated & wooded golf community in the mountains of Arden NC basically 15 mins from Asheville. This community joins Pisgah National Forest, approximately 300 square miles of forest. <BR><BR>This was around April or June of 2016. I was standing in the back yard facing the control box which is attached to the house. So my back was to the woods maybe 25 to 30 yards to the tree line. And I hear this large crash. The same sound a large tree makes as it falls through other tree limbs when its falling. I turned quickly to see a massive Beach tree rocking back and forth. Leaves were floating down but no tree was falling. <BR><BR>I''ve been in trees this size. I''m 6''2 250 pounds. There is no way I could make this tree rock like this. But i didn''t see what did it. So watched for probably 30 or 45 seconds. Nothing happened so turned to finish my work. Then it happened again but a different tree. This time I knew something was up. Bears don''t jump from tree to tree like that. So I walked to the edge of the yard and watched for a few minutes. No movement in the trees. The canopy is really thick here. The only way I could have really seen anything that was hiding would have been to walk to the bottom of the tree and look up. But I wasn''t about to do that. So after a while I walked back to the control again but I walked backwards. Seems silly but I felt whatever it was it was watching me. <BR><BR>When I reached the control I turned to face it. Then turned back to the woods again quickly to see if I could trick it or catch it jumping. But nothing happened. So I started working again assuming the show was over. <BR><BR>Then it happened again, a third big tree was rocking after the loud crash. At this point I was freaked out so ran to the truck and left. Rescheduled the job. <BR><BR>I''ve been in the forst my whole life. I''ve never been afraid in the day time. Bears don''t do that. They climb up and down. Cats don''t make loud crashes if they would have they would have run after the first one. What ever did this has to be huge. I couldn''t make those trees rock if i wanted to. Plus it was watching and waiting for the perfect time to jump so I wouldn''t see it. Bears here aren''t that worried about being seen. They know they can''t be hunted in those developments. You have to make them leave. This was something different. I wish I had the balls to walk to the base of the trees. But I don''t. I was afraid. I''ve been training to handle myself. I always carry a gun. But this wasn''t something I could handle. I just know . ",

We had a cat that wasn''t supposed to be in the house, so when he ran inside and hid under our bunk beds I had to go and get him. I bent down to pick him up from under the bed, and as I stood back up, I looked out the window that was right in front of me. As I looked out at the starry sky I was shocked, if not terrified, to see the dark outline of a strange figure walking past the window. <BR><BR>Because of the tree tops, I could only see the top half of the body, but I would estimate it to be at least seven feet tall.

I told my husband that it is a Bigfoot!!! <BR><BR>In a panic I drove away and my husband insisted that we turn around and go back. I was in tears from the fear, but we found an area to turn around and I do so.  As we approached that area, we saw it on the side of the road watching us. He was HUGE!!!! My husband got out of the car to get a better look and he couldn''t believe what we were looking at. It had to be at least 8-9 feet tall, covered in long black hair all over it''s body. It was massive. We were about 100 yards away and nothing was obstructing our view.

    " Shortly after laying down for the night during a backpacking trip in the Nantahala Wilderness, we heard a howl that lasted 10-15 seconds, with a change of tone for the last few seconds. This howl could not have been mistaken for any other animal and sounded very similar to recordings of other howls. In the next 2 hours we both heard random whoops also.  The next day while hiking we came across several very interesting signs along the trail. The first was spotting what looked like a game trail that crossed the hiking trail. Upon closer inspection, the tracks in the well traveled trail clearly were not made by bear or any other four legged animal.  The footprints on the trail had left deep impressions where the heel contacted the ground and footprints much larger than my foot were also seen.  The distance between the tracks was approximately 5 feet on average and the depth of the tracks where the heel had sunk down was 3 plus inches.   The ferns and weeds in the trail that had been pressed down were still green and flat which made me think the tracks had been made within the past couple of days. I followed the trail in both directions for approximately 150 yards and the footprints remained consistent in both directions.  After traveling the hiking trail further down the ridgeline for close to mile I spotted another trail that crossed the hiking trail. The footprints here were identical to what we saw at the first trail. I took pictures to gauge the depth and length of the prints.  I found a stick on this trail that had blood on it.  I regret not keeping it for evidence to see what type of blood it was.  The location of both trails had some similarities: both were located in gaps along the ridgeline and there was an unusually high amount of limbs and trees wedged in tree forks at both sites.  One other strange observation made along the trail was finding 3 large white mushrooms placed upside down near the trails. One of these was on a rock and another was found on the trail while following the footprints.  The area where we found these signs was the direction where we had heard the howl the night before.  <BR>",

    " I am a BFRO investigator in the mountains of Western North Carolina. Having lived in the mountains all of my life, I have enjoyed hunting, hiking and mountain things since I was a boy. So, I am very comfortable with being in the woods and for years have taken late night drives to see wildlife. For the past few years, I have been taking late night drives to my research are on good weather nights. It was Tuesday June 23rd, 2015; the weather was good and I decided to take a late drive to my research area. <BR>I was still on the main road taking my time and within 5 miles of my destination. I was not really thinking about Sasquatch but just enjoying the late night drive and some music.  As I was rounding a slight turn on the road, I saw a coyote on the right side of the road. I slowed slightly as my eyes panned back to the road and I then saw to my left the creature just off the road and behind the guardrail. My trucks side lights hit it just briefly where I could get a good look at it.<BR>My sighting was brief but I did get a good look at it. I could not believe what I saw! I went up the road and turned around as it caught me off guard I did not think to stop.  I was trying to talk myself out of what I saw. \"Could it been something else?\"<BR>The area on the left was very green so I thought I might have seen something else, maybe. As I approached the area I stopped and searched up and down for anything looking reddish/brown in color. Since it was June in the Mtns., everything was very green but nothing was brown at all. Bringing proof to me that it was a creature I saw.  It is very hard to describe the feeling I had at the time of the sighting and after. I was feeling very strange and could not believe what had just happened.<BR>This is what I saw.  Just past the guardrail and slightly off the bank of the road (this bank is very steep) I saw a reddish/brown upright figure. It had it''s back to me and I could see from the back and upper legs behind the guardrail. I am very sure it was on two legs with a most impressive width. The shoulders were very large and the head was slightly forward with a no neck type look.  The waist to shoulders made a very impressive \"V\" shape larger than any man I have ever seen. The hair was slightly long and had another color of gray/white underneath it with a main coat color of reddish/brown. Some of the back hair was shaggy looking. The left shoulder was slightly up and the arm was curled. The sighting was brief but I got a very good look at it. I could tell it was very tall. I did a sketch.<BR>After turning around and checking the sighting area from my truck, I pulled off about 150 yards below on the side of the road.  I got out of my truck to listen for about 10 minutes and then did a \"Howl Call\". I immediately got a response from a pack of coyotes. They were very close and below the road about 150 yards away. (This would be the side of the road the creature was on.) I tried driving back up the road to see anything and about 100 yards above where I saw the creature I saw a Wild Boar feeding on the side of the road. Later on I stopped at an overlook about 1/4 mile past the sighting and made another \"howl call\". I got an immediate response from an owl behind me close to the parking lot. Then just after this response I heard another owl call in the valley below me towards the sighting area. It was the loudest owl call I have ever heard! I have heard many different owl calls but this one was very strange. The volume of it was very strange and loud.<BR>I stayed in the area for 4 more hours with nothing more happening.  The next afternoon me and friend went back to the general area of the sighting and looked for tracks. We could only see disturbances as the ground was very rocky, steep and hard.<BR>I cannot fully explain my feeling after the sighting. I really noticed I was feeling strange when I had gone to get a drink a few miles away in a store. I notice I was sweating and feeling very odd. I think that I was slightly in a state of shock. I feel like this was due to me seeing something I had not seen ever before and something that was hard for me to process. I have been hunting and in the woods all of my life. I have seen every animal in our area in many situations. Trust me, I have never seen anything like this before.<BR>Important footnote:  This sighting happened just within about 6-7 miles from another reported incident that I investigated. BFRO report 49148 happened on June 29th, 2015; 6 days after the sighting I had. I feel like this is more than a coincidence. ",

I turned towards the figure but couldnt see anything. It was entirely too large to be a black bear and definitely wasnt an elk. I havent seen any at all this weekend. The figure was very black.
