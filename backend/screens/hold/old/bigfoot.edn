      " This is the third in a set of chronological reports that I am submitting regarding a series of encounters I had between 1970 and 1983 in Nevada, California, and Washington States.<BR><BR>This third encounter occurred in August 1972, when I was 12, at my home, roughly ten days after our encounter at the dry wash.  <BR><BR>I have previously described nearby Peavine Mountain and Lemmon Valley.  Our house was located on the East side of the valley.  It was in a new development at the time, tucked back in a draw among several steep hills.  The surrounding hills rose from 50 to 250 feet above our neighborhood and were primarily granite outcroppings.  The soil was coarse granite sand interspersed with boulders of various sizes.  Where there was vegetation on the hills, it was predominantly sagebrush.  In the draws, the sand was less coarse and there were a variety of grasses and other weeds.<BR><BR>We had just moved into the newly completed house a few weeks earlier and were getting to know our neighbors, all of whom had just moved into their new homes as well.  Like many of our neighbors, we were building a fence and otherwise improving our property.  At the time, there was only one thing to detract from the new neighborhood -- the presence of a pack of feral dogs.<BR><BR>The pack was composed of four large dogs -- two Dobermans and a couple of mixed breeds.  They were a matter of some concern because many of the new residents had small children and the pack displayed absolutely no trace of fear of people.  They would generally appear around dusk, when it began to cool, and boldly range through the neighborhood.  At night you could often hear them in the surrounding hills, barking and baying occasionally.  It didn''t take long to determine that they had no owner and one of our neighbors, an animal control officer for the city of Reno, told us that he had arranged for the county to do something about them.<BR><BR>Our home was an \"L\" shaped ranch, with two of four bedrooms in the back, at the top of the \"L\", and a garage in front, at the bottom right of the \"L\", facing the street.  We had partially constructed a cedar plank fence around the property, starting in back and working our way around the property clockwise.  We had completed the fence on the side of the property at the top of the \"L\", and had built a small section of fence connecting the back left corner of the \"L\" to the fence on that side.  This created a small cul-de-sac behind the house.  Along the side of the property to the right of the \"L\", we had set the posts and rails.  Along the front, where we intended to connect it to the garage, at the lower right corner of the \"L\", we had set the posts, but hadn''t yet put in the rails.  You could, essentially, walk right into our back yard from the street side of the house, but could not leave the yard on the back side without climbing over the fence.<BR><BR>On the night of the encounter, I had picked up all of the two-by-fours we hadn''t used as rails yet and I had stacked them horizontally along the base of the fence back in the cul-de-sac.  This was a precaution since they were pilferable and we weren''t the only ones building a new fence.<BR><BR>My bedroom was at the top, right corner of the \"L\".  The ground outside my window was about a foot and a half below the floor of my room.  My mother had already planted a small flowerbed of marigolds there.  To protect it, she had me put in one of those small, white-painted, wire trellises that reminds you of a bunch of coat-hangers welded together.  To put it in I had to heavily wet down the ground, then force it in.  Once the ground dried, the powdered granite and sand set like concrete.  It was about a foot high.<BR><BR>The incident occurred between midnight and 12:30 am.  It was late summer and I was awake late reading.  I had my window open, but the drapes were closed.  That night, the pack of feral dogs had been more noisy than usual.  Every so often, their barking would become particularly strident, drawing my attention away from my book.  I remember thinking to myself, over the course of fifteen minutes or so, that they were chasing another jackrabbit, then deciding that it must be a coyote, since they''d been going at it for longer than usual, then wondering if they might have a cougar at bay, since they were still barking and baying loudly, but seemed stationary.  <BR><BR>I was just turning back to my book, when I realized that they had started moving again, and were coming down the street in the direction of the house.  I started to sit up, intending to go to the living room window to see what they were chasing, but realized that they would be well past the house before I could get to the living room in front.  As I listened, though, the noise of the pursuit didn''t decrease the way I expected it to do as they chased their quarry past the opposite side of the house.  Instead it grew louder, and I realized that, whatever they were chasing, they were chasing it into our back yard.  I also realized that they might corner it behind the house in the cul-de-sac.  Excited, I started to get up to look out the window.<BR><BR>Before I could get up, though, their quarry rounded the back right corner of the garage heading in the direction of my bedroom at the back right corner of the house.  For just a second, I could clearly hear it running, as the sound of the dogs was still partially masked around the corner of the garage.  As it covered the twenty feet between the two corners, I heard three distinct, heavy footfalls -- one just as it rounded the garage, one midway between the garage and the corner of the house, and the third just under my window, where the wire trellis was set firmly into the ground.  This was followed by an incredible impact into the corner of the house.  The force was so great that I could hear the four-by-four upright in the wall crack and the whole room shook.  The impact and cracking sound came from a point about five and a half feet above the level of the ground outside.  Simultaneously, there was a secondary impact about seven feet above ground level across the top right corner of my window as viewed from outside.  The window rattled violently in the frame and I was sure it was cracked.  Immediately following the two simultaneous impacts, there was a forced grunt as if the wind had been knocked out of whatever it was and I could hear its body fall heavily to the ground.<BR><BR>My first thought was, \"Oh my God!  They''re chasing a man!\"  The footfalls were clearly bipedal, the height of the impacts was too high for it to be anything four-legged, and the sound of it having its wind knocked out was manlike, if somewhat heavy.  Also from the sound of its fall, it went from an erect to a prone position.  At the same time I recognized that something was strange.  The \"man\" hadn''t called for help, hadn''t made any vocal noises at all, in fact.  He had covered twenty feet in what was essentially two strides, and had hit the house at a point too high for all but the largest of men.  The secondary impact across the outside corner of the window was also too high for most people to reach, and the force of the impact, strong enough to make the four-by-four in the house''s frame crack, indicated much more mass than any normal person would have.<BR><BR>I didn''t spend any time really thinking about this, though.  Even though I had an underlying uneasiness because the sounds indicated that the guy was huge, I was sure the dogs were chasing a man.  The dogs closed on the man, snarling and barking.  I was afraid he was lying on the ground, injured or unconscious, and I realized that I had to do something.  I immediately threw my sheet off, jumped out of bed, and reached for the drapes, intending to throw them open and yell at the dogs -- about all I could do in the situation.  In the two or three seconds it took to do this, though, it didn''t sound like the dogs were mauling the man.  They were about three feet from the house, stationary, barking and growling.  It sounded as if there were only three of them, two very aggressive and ready to attack, and one that was barking the way a dog would if it were afraid of you, but ready to attack if provoked.<BR><BR>Just as my fingertips touched the drapes, the scariest thing I have ever experienced in my life happened (believe me, this is saying a lot for someone who has spent nineteen years in the military and lived through a parachute malfunction).  Somehow the man had recovered from hitting the house, having the wind knocked out of him, and falling.  He had somehow managed to stand up and get his breath back and just as I touched the drapes, from a point immediately outside my window, level with and about two feet from my head, He Growled Back at the dogs.<BR><BR>The growl wasn''t loud.  It was only about two and a half seconds long.  But it was the meanest, deepest, and most menacing growl I have ever heard in my life (to include those of trapped brown bears at Yellowstone).  It was almost as if he was keenly aware that there were people around, that he knew precisely how long he had to growl to get his point across, and that he didn''t want to make any more noise than he absolutely had to.<BR><BR>For the next several seconds there was absolute silence.  He didn''t make any more noise.  The dogs didn''t even make any sounds of movement.  And I was frozen in fear and shock, praying that he wouldn''t notice I was there, and afraid he would hear me if I moved at all.    <BR><BR>It was like that for several long seconds, then, all but silently, I heard him step and brush around the corner of the house.  <BR><BR>A second later the dogs were after him, but the head start was all he needed.  I heard the stack of two-by-fours tumble down and the sound of him hitting the six foot cedar fence as he went over it, followed by the dogs hitting the fence and then scratching at it and barking.  After a few moments the dogs stopped trying to get over the fence and raced back around the house clockwise.  <BR><BR>As I heard the dogs racing down the street, I relaxed slightly and gulped for breath.  I hadn''t even realized I''d been holding it.  I immediately choked.  The \"Thing\" had left an incredible stench.  It was overpowering.  It smelled like a combination of wet dog, stale urine, and rancid sweat.  There was also an acrid component a little like burnt rubber.  It was so bad that I staggered away from the window.<BR><BR>I stood there for a few moments trying to decide what to do.  The thing was gone, the dogs were gone, and all I would accomplish by waking my parents would be to anger my father.  I decided it wasn''t worth it.  I thought about going outside but really didn''t want to poke around out there in the dark.  I was struggling with what I had just experienced.  Whatever had been outside my window was manlike, but clearly was not a man.  I had no frame of reference to place it in.  I didn''t relate the experience to my encounter at the dry wash because I had so thoroughly convinced myself that that had been a man.  I closed my window (which to my amazement was not broken), got back in bed, and tried to read to get my mind off of the incident.  Eventually I fell asleep.<BR><BR>The next morning I woke after my father had left for work.  I looked out my window and could see that the flowerbed -- trellis and all -- had been flattened.  I got dressed and went outside.  The ground was scuffed but there were no distinctive footprints.  I choked down my apprehension and walked back into the fenced cul-de-sac behind the house.  The stack of two-by-fours was lying there toppled.  I looked at the cedar fence.  The scratch marks from the dogs'' nails were clear.  Caught on the top of one of the planks was a tuft of coarse hair.  I stepped up on the lower rail of the fence and looked at it closely in the bright morning sunlight.  It was dark black with hints of brownish red highlights and about three inches long.  It had enough oil on it make it shine if you looked at it closely.  I struggled with whether it had come from the \"thing\" or one of the dogs.  After several moments of consideration I decided it was possible one of the Dobermans could have had some three inch strands of hair, that the colors were within the appropriate range, and that one of the dogs might actually have managed to make it over the fence to leave it there.  I left it where it was.  <BR><BR>I went back to the window and examined it and the siding on corner of the house closely.  I didn''t see any damage from the impacts.  I decided that the thing had been running, hadn''t seen the trellis, and had tried to cut around the corner of the house too closely.  The trellis, strongly embedded in the cement-like soil, tripped it and it fell, throwing its left arm(?) up in an attempt to maintain balance (or maybe grab the roof to catch itself).  The primary impact would have been from its body.  The secondary impact could have been from the left arm slapping the side of the house across the corner of the window.  <BR><BR>I went in and told my mother about the incident.  I was still very troubled and wanted to know what I had heard.  I discussed it at length with my father when he got home.  He was uncharacteristically patient and explained that it had either been a bear or a cougar.  I couldn''t accept either of these explanations.  It wasn''t until about a year later that I ran across a tourist pamphlet in Oregon that was about Bigfoot.  I can''t express how relieved I was at the time to learn that there was a potential explanation for what I had experienced.<BR><BR>We never saw or heard the dogs again after that night."

      " I heard a scream very similar to the one located at http://www.planetc.com/users/bigfoot/sound.htm titled Bigfoot sounds from Art Bell radio show. This scream sounded like two seperate animals and lasted for about 22 minutes. Of all the calls I have heard, this one was the loudest and most frightening."

      " This was told to me from a neighbor which showed me a cast of a foot print which was big(didn''t measure it)I was living in Edgewood at the time, Maryland, about 15mis. away or so from where it happened.The people had dogs getting into thier trash and the owner bought a 22 rifle to get the dogs as he put it. He has a cement pad about 10 by 6 ft with a fence 6ft high around three sides of it. The trash cans were inside the fence.On night he heard noises out side,he got his rifle and looked out back.The porch light showed nothing near the trash cans but outside the fence he could see a shape of something so he shot up in the air.The animal ,which he could only describe as a big ape,got up and he could see it''s shouders and head above the fence.It took off as it rose up turning back towards the woods in a hurry.It tore up freshly planted bushes in it''s path. The ground left  no tracks other then in the soft dirt around the bushes.That''s the plaster cast the neighbor showed me.He gave it to the neighbor because he decided he didn''t believe in what he saw and didn''t want to be haunted by the sighting.They had the police there but I guess he made sure it was kept out of the papers.He just didn''t want his name out there. <BR>"

    " Hiking the Seven Sisters Trail from Mt Holyoke to the Notch in the Hadley / Amherst area of Massachusetts. My hiking partner and I got to Taylor''s Notch and could hear the wind ripping through making eerie noises. We both heard a lot of whistling  and breaking branches which I initially attributed to the wind going through the rocky ledges of Taylor''s Notch. We hiked over one large hill and the wind was lessening but we realized the whistling was closer and then there were whooping noises and calls along with the whistles. The calls were going back and forth and I realized we were surrounded. We kept talking loudly hoping to scare off any animals and kept my bear spray in hand for the next mile or so. Not sure what it was but highly unusual and did not sound like a grown or baby bear,canine, coyote, mountain lion, or fox. I frequently hike and spend time outdoors. I am at a loss as to what was with us that day. I am going back soon to see if I can find more.",

    " First of all, I feel the need to preface this report with some background information. I have been in the process of writing a book on Ape Cave near Mt St Helens. I contacted Jeff Lemley about getting some reports about Bigfoot stories to add to my book. I have kept in close contact with Jeff since the first contact and emailed him immediately after we got back from our trip.<BR><BR>I told my husband, Larry, that I wanted to go camping at Peterson Prairie for my birthday (August 15th) with my twin sister, Vicki and her husband, Jim K. I thought it would be fun to take in a cave or two, time permitting. My husband and I are avid cavers and enjoy spending free time exploring the wild caves of Southern Washington State near Mt St Helens and Mt Adams. We both felt it would be a good time to introduce my sister and her husband (and their toy red Poodle, Sparky) to the sport of wild caving.<BR><BR>The four of us drove our two minivans through the Dark Divide and arrived at camp late in the day on the 14th. Our favorite camp spot was still available so we proceeded to set up camp. As it turned out, my sister and her husband, took the safe way out and set up camp in their Dodge Caravan, while I pitched our miniscule backpacking tent 50 feet South of the camp in a small clearing surrounding by small pines. It was just enough room to pitch a small tent and still be able to tie off the guy ropes to keep the rainfly away from the tent.<BR><BR>As far as I knew, the night was uneventful until my husband spoke up the next morning. Larry told all of us that he thought he heard a Bigfoot howling (my husband is an extreme skeptic when it comes to anything related to Bigfoot). We all talked about it for a while and then decided to get ready to go caving in Cheese Cave, a local lava tube. Later in the day, we rode our bikes to some local caves and then went back to camp. Later, Larry and I left my sister and her husband at camp to rest while we set out to find Dynamite Cave. We drove around all of the dirt roads in the STR that we thought it was supposed to be located in. We parked the van at several locations. At one spot, my husband started walking down a remote trail with me following a short distance behind him. I stopped on the trail not far from the car because I heard something very large run through the bush to my right, just off the trail. My husband kept going, but I was too apprehensive to move. Whatever it was, it was huge; but it didn''t sound like an elk moving through the bush. Also, I felt like something was watching me. It was quite creepy! Since Larry had moved out of sight, I felt very vunerable and literally ran up to catch up with him. I kept telling him I wanted to go back to the car; but didn''t want to go by the one spot alone. He finally relented and we walking briskly to the car.<BR><BR>That night we all walked to the clearing due East of camp, next to the road which led to the group camp to watch the stars and anything else interesting in the clear skies. After turning in about 10PM, we slept soundly until about 3AM, when I was awakened by an incredibly loud howling, unlike anything I had ever heard in my life. Since I am an avid outdoorsperson, I have camped out and seen and heard most of the wild things that occur in the forests and mountains. This was like nothing I had ever heard before. There was absolutely no other sounds from the forest until a Barred Owl responded to the howl. <BR><BR>I woke Larry up to ask him about the howls. He said that it was the very same thing that he heard the night before. We both listened to it banter back and forth with the owl. After maybe 10 to 15 minutes of howling, the owl took off flying North through the trees. We could both hear his wings flapping as he was hooting. He was much closer to us than the thing which was howling; but the howling was much louder than the owl. <BR><BR>What happened next sent chills down my spine. I was laying on my stomach in the tent, needing very much to go outside and relieve myself; but unwilling to venture outside due to the howlings I was still listening to. Larry had fallen back asleep, so unfortunately, the thing I heard next fell on my ears alone. The best I could describe it was a howling turning into an Ape-like chattering. It sounded like someone was practicing phonics by contorting their mouth, while at the same time, reciting all the vowels. That is the best I can describe it. The sounds were incredibly loud and quite frightening sounding. I lay motionless until the sounds died down and I fell asleep.<BR><BR>I was awakened one more time around 6:15 to 6:30 in the morning. Light was already finding its way into camp which I could see through the mosquito netting at the head of our tent. This time I heard a pack of coyotes start up, followed again by that same howling sound. At this point, I was really getting freaked out; but was still not willing to venture out of the tent. As soon as it was light enough, I got up and ran to my sister''s van. I rapped on their window and asked if they heard the howls. Of course, they hadn''t heard anything; but were quite interested in what Larry and I had heard that night.<BR><BR>When I got home, I emailed Jeff Lemley to see if he had any wave files to listen to that might sound like what we heard. I listened to every owl sound on the web and nothing sounded like what we heard. A few days later, I got an email from Jeff about the other report four days before ours, only 6 miles North of us. As I told Jeff, both my husband and I would like to think that the sounds we heard were in fact, Barred Owls. Anyone sleeping in a flimsy nylon tent would probably convince themselves of the same. But then again...",

    " Approx. summer of 2000, I was on Negus Mountain in Rowe, MA (Franklin County) with my wife, sitting on the tailgate...we heard something in the woods, about 100 yards away, walking towards us.  As it got closer, it started to walk faster.  As a life long hunter, I at first told her not to worry, it''s a squirrel or something.  As this creature got closer, my ears and experience told me that this was a biped, only 2 feet crunching through the leaves.  My wife was so freaked out that we had to leave immediately before I could investigate more.<BR><BR>Fast Forward to 2006, I was driving to work one night for the 2300 job in East Deerfield, MA.  I remember I was running a little late, so I was probably speeding, and the time would have been 2230ish.  It was raining lightly.  In West Charlemont, at the end of so-called Tea Street Extension, there is a bridge that carries the road over the railroad tracks. This is about 2-3 miles (the way the bird flies) from the encounter above.  What I saw was something standing perfectly still behind the guardrail.  It was about 6, maybe 6 and a half feet tall, had long brown hair all over it''s body, and was stock still.  I drive this route almost daily (or nightly, in my case) for over 12 years, I know what belongs and what doesn''t.  This did not belong.  I turned around and went back, and it was gone.  Being late for work, I turned around again and went to work.  I have never had any doubt that I saw a Sasquatch.  I haven''t reported it because I don''t want people to think I am a crackpot.  I just recently told my father about it, who told me to look into any organizations such as yours.",

    " I am 45 years old, have spent my whole life in the woods. I have been hunting and fishing since I was very young. On June 28th my wife and I decieded to take a walk in the woods. We were heading to a secluded resivior located aprox. 2 miles in the woods. We came upon a spot in the woods that seemed liked someone was watching us. We heard a noise come from some bushes. I thought it was a grunt from a buck. We both expected to a deer come outof the brush. I said, maybe it was a Bigfoot. She told me to shut up and keep walking. We walked for another 15 minutes and realized we were on the wrong path to the lake. We stopped, ate lunch and headed back into the woods. We had stopped at some power lines and sat in some shade. It was over 94 gegrees that day, and this was about noon time.<BR>As we walked back, we both noticed some very DEEP foot prints that did not look right. They were clearly 5 toed \"Human\" prints. In between the prints, was some deer tracks. The tracks clearly looked like the Human prints were chasing the deer prints. We both looked at each other and said, why would someone be running Barefoot, in 100 degree weather in the middle of the woods on a Tuesady afternoon? There were no other people in the woods at that time. The tracks were not there the first time we passed this spot, the noise was, the tracks were not. At this point I became very concerned that what ever made the prints was still in the area. I grabbed a big rock and told my wife to take some pictures with her cell phone. The tracks were about 6 to 7 feet apart. I could tell the first print was a right foot, that jumped out of the woods. The sixth and final step was a left foot that looked like it pushed off into the woods. No other tracks were before or after these six prints. We both became very nervous and started talking loudly and whistling. I did not want to run into this \"person\". We became a little confused and ended up on the worng path home. We walked for a couple hours, no way were we going back the way we came.<BR><BR><BR>Did not notice any smells or sounds. Just very quiet. No animal sound at all.",

    " Hi, my name is xxxxxx, I grew up in Rowley, MA.. a small old farming town established in 1639.. when I was 10, I''m now 27, my friend an I were attempting to find a way through the woods from his home street to a plaza containing a dunkin donuts for the fun of it. like I said, I grew up in the woods and this is only a distance of about a half of a mile. We started out heading in the direction we thought was good and after a while we heard a noise in the distance.. at this point we were pretty deep into just new England forest when we heard something. in the distance.. (far enough to be a hard definite sighting but close enough to be odd as hell to this day) so we looked obviously and in the middle of the woods.. randomly.. were three.. THREE, tanned brown.. (not brown black, or brown brown, but brown tan) upright creatures, running through the woods together. AS IF THEY WERE TRAVELING!!!! they were close and tight and jogging along on the hill we were on about 400 yards away.. we just watched speechless and then decided it was time to give up on finding our way and head back. I don''t know if he told anyone ever, but we lost touch over the years, but that sighting will forever connect us.. I just thought anyone who follows bigfoot should know about this.. these 3 creatures were tanned and brown, upright, jogging in a line, and fully unclothed.. I''ve seen one other unexplained sighting, but this one was absolutely dumbfounded.. I don''t know if anyone has ever seen multiple bigfoots traveling together but I have. ",

    "I do recall now after reading some accounts - about a \"path\" deep in the woods about a mile long that ran parallel to the houses. It was about 500 feet back of my house along an old stone wall. It was covered ( canopy of trees) and very dark-even on bright days. I would occasionally walk through the woods and found this path. The entrance was through the woods 1/4 mile down the street and through a dense pine grove - you would then enter an open field and then enter this dark section of woods. I found an irregular path that rambled - but always wondered why there were many broken branches and samll trees and closed in areas(like small trees pulled together) and the rocks in the wall would be all over the place - some of them were good size. I always thought that maybe some kids used this path to school or built forts or something but I now realize it was too dense and not really in the right direction to the schools. I never heard any kids out back in all the years I have been here (almost 30 years)",

    " Twenty Five years ago (1979) I heard the most awful and terrifying screams for 3 nights in a row. We had just built a two story addition which is situated further back on a lot (about 150 feet) into the woods from the street. This area was considered suburban but was fairly rural at that time. There are houses built along the street that are on lots of 3/4 to 1 acre. We own several acres of heavily wooded land and our house sits back on the lot further than the others. The section of woods is borderd by 3 state highways and was about 1 mile (length) by 1 1/2 miles (width)of woods and some farmland fields. At the time there were only two dead end streets that penetrated this section of woods. Another country road separates this section on the west with a State park nearby (1/2 mile from the road). This park is several hundred acres of lakes and heavily wooded areas. The area now is filled with housing and development.<BR><BR>It was July and was very hot (90 degrees +) and the peepers were very loud. Each evening between 2:00 and 3:30 a.m. an extremely loud howling, screaming sound would start far away. As it came closer ( the screams lasted for 20-30 seconds each and occurred every 1-2 minutes or so) you could hear bushes and branches being swept out of the way with loud crunching and breaking sounds and screams that would get louder in intensity. The woods at that time were covered with thick vines and brambles that were about 3-5 feet high. It was extremely difficult to walk through any section of the woods that was not cleared. You just didn''t stroll through the woods, especially in the pitch black. When this \"thing\" came closer all the peepers and the night sounds completely ceased. The sound was so loud in volume that it actually caused you to \"freeze\" - I mean that it ran your blood cold!  I remember laying in bed not wanting to investigate because whatever it was - it was BIG and I did not want to find out what it was! It was not the sound of a bear, a mountain lion or a wounded deer.The sound had a human quality about it and was like - it was searching for something and had a sense of pain or distress abut it. It would travel parallel through the woods about 100 feet behind my house. On the third night I got up immediately and waited for this thing to get closer. I have a switch in the bedroom that would turn on some roof mounted flood lights that would shine in the back yard. We did not have a deck or anything at the time and the woods were about 25 feet behind the house. This thing was crashing through the woods and when it was right behind the house it gave out this huge loud moan. I was looking out the window with all the inside lights out and then I turned on the floodlights. The scream stopped and there was silence for about 5 seconds and then it crashed through the woods away from the house very quickly opposite the direction it came from. You could hear the crashing of a two footed creature. I heard the crashing sounds for about another minute and then it faded and was quiet. I was really spooked and went downstairs and started turning on all the lights and the outside lights. I noticed that all my neighbors were turning on their outside lights as well. This was unusual because no one left outside lights on and there were no street lights in this section of the street.There were at least 4 other houses that turned their lights on. I contemplated whether to call the police but did not. The next day while mowing the lawn, my elderly neighbor across the street from me came over and said \"Dave, did you hear those sounds last night? I have heard them for several nights and almost called the cops - if I hear it again I am calling the police - I never heard anything like that in my life.\" I agreed and it was good that someone else confirmed the incident to me. All these years I have only told close friends of this story and the kidding I take is unmerciful- but I know to this day what I heard was absolutely real. I forgot about it for many years until I saw some \"bigfoot\" documentary in the early 1990''s. They played a recording and when I heard it- it brought back the whole incident. It was almost identical to the sound! I have played the sound recordings on various websights and would say that it was pretty close to the Ohio or Pennsylvania recordings. I never heard anything after 1979 and I did not see anything. Perhaps others have given reports from this area and this report may be helpful. I am being truthful about this - I do not drink or do any nonprescription drugs - I am a church administrator in a Bible (nondenominational) church.  ",

    "  I am 61-yo and have been an outdoorsman all of my life doing numerous backpacking and mountaineering trips in the Cascades and Olympics. I have a degree in psychology from the UW and currently employed as an Investigator. <BR><BR>My 15-yo son and I made camp at twilight off FS road 25,  after doing a recon of the Lewis River area for hunting. It is a rain forest there with huge cedar trees and large moss-covered maples reminding me of the Hoh Rain Forest. We set up camp on the east side of a creek. We had my 4-Runner parked and set up a tent. <BR><BR> After a steak dinner, I made some howls in the manner of the \"Ohio howls\" that I had made that had called in a Squatch at Lake Ozette (report #65667). I am a trained vocalist and can project my voice considerably. After no response, we retired for the evening.<BR><BR> At approx 10 pm, we were awakened by a loud crack of a branch very close to our tent. I jumped out of my bag with a 400-lumen flashlight and searched 360 degrees hoping to spot the culprit. After several minutes and intense searching to no avail, we went back to sleep only to be woken by howls off in the distance to the south of us an hour later. I would guess that the howls were coming from a single individual approx a mile away from us. My son reported that he had heard footsteps later near the tent that night but failed to wake me. <BR><BR> In the morning, my son discovered a single footprint near the tent. I have photos. It is a very wide right footprint approx a size 13 that was very deep (1/2 inch) in the dirt. I am sure the print is still there as it has not rained since drafting this report. Despite a large rock in the near middle of the arch, the print is deep and was not affected by it. I could not make a print at all and I weigh 250lbs.<BR><BR> I have always been keenly interested in Sasquatch and was convinced that they exist after reading Dr. Meldrum''s Where legend Meets Science book.  I have had encounters after mimicking the Ohio Howl with remarkable success. I suspect the government has proof and is keeping it quiet to protect this cryptohominid with wilderness areas (Lone Butte/Indian Heaven). I am studying maps of an area I reasoned to be prime habitat and have a trip planned overland off-trail/road soon. Time to get serious... ",

    " My girlfriend and I were staying at her parent''s house near Marlborough, New Hampshire.  I am writing on her behalf because of my access to the internet.  I also have an interest in bigfoot related stories and lore and so am familiar with this website.  However, I have not had any experiences or encounters myself.  <BR>This particular night, my girlfriend was startled by an unusual howling scream while watching t.v. at approximately 11:45 p.m. (her father and I were asleep and did not hear anything).  The howling scream seemed to eminate from across the street in an area that is heavily wooded.  At the first scream she thought that she must have heared an injured person''s cry.  There were approximately four screams (although she is unsure about this), each about 5 seconds apart.  After hearing the second scream she went to the front door (about 10'' from her) and stood outside on the stoop where she heard the last two screams.<BR>She estimated the distance to the screams as approximately 400 feet, to the other side of the street where there is a solitary house.  I believe, however, that the screams may have been much farther away.  She says that they were ''very loud'' and stationary, i.e. they didn''t sound louder or fainter with each progressive one.  She also notes that they sounded as if from around the corner of the house, not a clear shot from her to the point of origin.  In other words, she doesn''t beleive that the ''animal'' could have seen her at the front door.<BR>The next day she described what she heard to me and I immediately thought of the recordings from your site.  Her description sounded alike.  After returning from our trip I played the recordings to her (over the phone) and she says, \"identical,\" specifically the 1978 recording from Snohomish County, Washington.   ",

    " Audio Experience only:<BR><BR>Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, wooo....<BR><BR>Sunday, September 12, 2004 at about 03:00 AM<BR>I was woken up from a sound sleep by a very loud noise.  I listened for a while and tried to figure out what could make such a loud, repetitive noise.  It wasn''t a coyote howl or fishercat screach, didn''t sound like any owl I know of, wasn''t a raccoon or tree rodent...  After 15 - 20 minutes, I went to sleep.<BR><BR>My dog woke me with frightened barking at 4:00 AM when the sound was twice as loud and I knew the critter was within 100 feet of the house.  Also, there were two responding calls, one sounded fairly close and one was in the distance.  I got up to make sure the sheep were OK in their pasture with an electric fence around it and there was nothing by the barn where the goats were.  I flashed the light over to the chicken coop and nothing was there either.  I flashed the light throughout the yard and into the trees to see if there was any clue or any danger to the animals.  I saw nothing and while I shone the light, the calls ceased.<BR><BR>All day I asked EVERYONE if they knew of any local animal that made the noise and repeated it all day long.  A friend suggested that I look it up on the internet.  I listened to all sorts of animal vocalizations with no luck.  When I finally typed in the words of the actual sound it was an identical match to this site!!!  I''m not saying I had a bigfoot encounter, but I definately encountered whatever the campers up in Lincoln, NH encountered last summer!!!  There may be a rational explaination and someone may know of an indigenous animal that makes that sound -- and trust that I will still try to find out what it is... but the sound will resonate in my memory -- as it was like no other animal/bird I''ve ever heard.  It was not too fast, nor garbled, it was incredibly loud and clear.  The dog was very nervous.",

    " I took a 3 day/2 night solo backpacking trip in Washington state, up the Ape Canyon Trail, around the base of Mt. St. Helens, and through the Muddy River drainage this past July 5th through 7th.   On the  first day of the hike at around 1 pm, as I made my way up the Ape  Canyon Trail, I was surprised to hear a series of \"whooping\" calls, a  series of 5 whoops in a row spaced at intervals of about 30 seconds to  1 minute apart, 5-7 sets over the course 10-15 minutes.  The calls (bwaaahh-bwaaahh-bwaaahh) sounded as if they were emanating  from the bottom of an oil drum, the tone being deep and bodily palpable, even though sounding maybe a mile or more away in the direction of the canyon, and somewhat north of the trail. It struck  me as unnaturally deep and projecting (although not overly loud) and unlike any animal call I had ever heard before (I have hiked and camped in forest and wilderness areas for many years).  I did not hear any  other calls during course of my hike, save what sounded like an  enormous owl hooting near my tent site on the edge of the Muddy River drainage on my 2nd night, at around 2 am.  It was very loud and I was not inclined to get out of my tent for a look-see.  One other thing I found intrigued me though.  On a game trail that slips off of the main trail, just down hill from a ground spring adjacent to the trail 1-2 miles from the trailhead, I came across a couple of downed trees approx. 4-5\" in diameter, twisted or snapped off and laying across the trail in a cross-x pattern. The trees were placed on the trail between the spring and a small meadow farther down the hill.   There were no signs of a lightening strike, no evidence of chopping or sawing was apparent, and the trees looked otherwise healthy and normal, and looked as if they had been pulled over and broken off toward the top of the tree.",

    " When I was about 10 years old my father took me and a friend camping up in Indian Heaven. We parked and then hiked about 3 miles uphill to Lake Wapiki there. It was beautiful mid August and hot. While hiking up to the camp spot I remember having a sense of someone looking at me from the forest. I do have a big imagination though so I didn''t think to much about it.<BR> We arrived at our camp spot and set everything up. We were camping next to a large dried up creek bed and I remember looking at it and following it a little ways down. Picking huckleberries and exploring the rest of the area, I spent the rest of my day just having fun.<BR>  That night, after I and my friend and Dad had gone to bed, we were awakened by a stampede of deer or elk or something. There were at least 10 because it lasted about 20 to 30 seconds and they were running right through our camp. Scared the hell out of me. I remember my Dad getting up and making sure we were all right. Everything was fine and so I slowly fell back asleep.<BR> Next morning I woke up and looked around and it looked like some of our cooking gear was scattered about the camp, probably from the stampede running right through. And then I saw it what makes me believe in Bigfoot. There in the dried creek bed was a huge footprint. And i''m not talking about a human print. Though this foot print could have been made by a man, it was way too big and wide. I estimate a size 20 and it was like 4 to 5 inches across. Huge foot print. Scared me half to death.<BR> I was thinking about it and I think a bigfoot had scared the deer or elk into the stampede. So there is my story about bigfoot. I believe 100% in bigfoot. I know this story isn''t all that. It''s not like I saw him or anything but what i saw made me believe.<BR><BR>   <BR>",

    " I put together a mountain bike trip with a cousin for a weekend in Central Vermont near the town of Plymouth in the Calvin Coolidge state forest. <BR><BR>We decided on a Lean-To shelter called TinkerBrook on the outskirts of the forest near the backside of Killington Peak. One reason for this location was because of the steep topography the area offered for a mountain biker. Also, not to many people visit this shelter according to the Rangers I''ve talked to before due to the hike in and lack of 4x4 access as well. The place offers nothing more than a view of a steep forested ravine. The shelter is right on the edge of this ravine as well.<BR><BR>We travelled up Shrewsbury road which intersects RT100 south of Plymouth and then heads west almost straight up the nearest mountain in a series of switchbacks. We then parked our vehicle on the bend in the road where tinkerbrook shelter trail starts. The trail/road is heavily blocked off by boulders and easy to miss. We packed up the bikes and headed down the old trail/road to the shelter. The shelter is about a 3/4 mile off the forest road we parked the vehicle on.<BR><BR>We set up camp for the night in the shelter and did a look around. The place offered no trails to ride on and the ravine was so steep that you needed to climb out of it using the roots of the trees in it. The place was very isolated.<BR><BR>We headed off to bed around 9:00pm and left a campfire going near the opening of the shelter. A few hours later (12:00am) my cousin woke me up saying that he was hearing and feeling knocks on the shelter. I told him to go back to sleep. Then I heard and felt the noises myself.<BR><BR>The sounds were like something big pushing against the shelter. I thought it could of been a moose or bear and decided to go around back to see. I took a flashlight and went around back within a minute of hearing the noise again. There was nothing there to see.<BR><BR>This continued a few more times during the night until maybe 3:00am. I felt the bumping sounds near my side of the shelter on occasion. We didn''t get much sleep and at one point I even pulled all the firewood close to the opening to keep a large fire going.<BR><BR>In the morning we looked for any damage to the shelter and found nothing. We also looked around for any sign on the ground (footprints, loose rocks, scrapes and hoofmarks) but found nothing.<BR><BR>We decided not to stay another night and headed out. <BR><BR>",

    " On July 3rd, 2016, at around 7AM I was fishing at Norwich Pond in Lyme, CT.  I caught my first fish within minutes of arriving.  When I brought the fish to shore I heard 3 distinct knocks coming from behind and above me. There is a rather steep, high (30 ft?) slope along the access road near the boat ramp. I turned around thinking it was people walking down the road.  Nothing there...  I threw the fish back and recast.  I caught another within a few minutes.  As i brought this one to shore, I heard another 3 distinct knocks from the same spot and again turned around to see if someone was there.  No one! This boat launch/pond is about 4 - 5 miles in from the main road and the only houses around were on the other side of the pond, the opposite direction of the knocks.  I am pretty sure it was an encounter with Sasquatch even though I did not see or smell one.  The knocking was too \"human\" to be an animal and there were NO people around.",

    " There is a small pond located in the wildlife management area in Harwinton. I have frequently visited this place throughout my youth, and adulthood to fish, camp, hike, bike, and hunt.<BR>The pond is spring fed, and is located in a flood conroll area. A town built dam at one end helps contoll the water level, but at the time of the incident the dam was poorly built.<BR>In late summer the water level in the pond would drop drastically, and create a higher concenration of fish. The best time to go fishing was at night when temps. were cooler.<BR>On this one particular night I decided to go moonlight topwater bassi''n alone. I parked my car at the entance gate around 9:00pm, and proceeded on foot down the service road. The moonlight was intense, and afforded me the luxury of saving my flashlight batteries for most of the treck. The trip from the road to the pond is approx. 3/4 of a mile, and takes you through several fields wich are cut in the summer.On the way i startled some deer that were around a salt lick, they ran off in the opposite direction of the pond.<BR>I walked through the final field, and over a stone wall, onto a path that leads directly to the spot on the pond where i wanted to fish.The area from the stone wall to the pond is wooded, and recquired use of the flashlight.<BR>The path, and woodline end in an area of land that juts out into the pond, forming a point. Due to the low water level, it was another 50 yds. walk to get to the waters edge. I fished off of a couple of rocks that jutted out even further.<BR>I had been fishing for approximately an hour, and havig some luck. The moon was full, and almost directly overhead. I was out in the wide open, and could see very well all around the shoreline. The woodline around the pond was spaced from the water at least 30yards plus in all directions. The moonlight did not penetrate into the woods, and so I could not see into them. I felt as though I were on center stage to anything that might be in the woods wathing me. All of a sudden out of nowhere a loud and deep sound eminated direclty from the woodline where I had entered the area. My knees went weak, and I nearly fell off the rocks. I turned to face the area in a ducking position trying to see what it was. The sound was again repeated after a short pause, and then nothin. I pointed my flashlight in the direction of the sound,but it was too far and too weak, not even an eyeshine. This was all that I heard.<BR>The sounds were as follows: WWRRUUMMMPFSFSFSFSSS!!-twice in succession, then a short pause (10 sec.) followed by the same WWRRUUMMMPFSFSFSSS!!-Twice in succession.<BR>The sounds were deep, and came from something large, (200+lbs.) They echoed across the pond! They were definitely directed at me, something was letting me know it was there.<BR>I found it odd that pryor to and after, there were no sounds of walking in the woods. Watever this was made a stealthy approach, and exit. I never heard anything again.<BR>I stayed and fished nervously for another hour, and left the area scared but without incident.<BR> <BR>",

    " My brother and I camped overnight in High Point State Park, New Jersey, the other night. Driving around the park, the camping sites were labeled with numbers. We wanted to set up in a place as far away as we could from the other people. I myself, have known the existence of Sasquatch to be real for quite some time. Not from a personal experience which was yet to come, but because of watching so many people tell their stories of encounters, and just seeing the genuine fright and truthfulness in their eyes when they tell their stories. My brother however, always laughed at the subject of Bigfoot, and was a complete skeptic. So, my brother and I has set up camp on the edge of what I''m assuming was the only lake in the park. We walked through the forest in the daytime, and indeed found many peculiar structures and tree breaks I had seen before on Bigfoot TV shows. As night fell, we made a fire, and watched the numerous stars reveal themselves as the night got darker. Around 12 o''clock at night I went over to a rock right by the edge of the lake and looked up at the stars, while my brother tended the fire. I''m an astronomy fan, so before I knew it I had been sitting there for two hours when I checked my phone and it said it was nearing 2 in the morning. Just then my phone ran out of battery. While sitting on the rock, I began to feel a weird sensation that someone or something was watching me, I checked to see if it was my brother but he was staring into the fire. I dismissed this feeling and told myself I had just brought it on myself. I looked back up at the stars and got lost in some train of thought when all of the sudden, something made a very loud noise that could only be described as a very large man exhaling aggressively towards me. I jumped up and ran to my brother, and we heard the thing walk towards the forest, all the while breaking branches and continuing to make the same aggressive noise I heard so close to me. It got quiet, and my brother and I were standing looking in the direction where all the noise had came from when it made the noise again. Now, I don''t speak Sasquatch but that thing was telling us to get the heck out of there. I don''t get scared easily at all, and I was shaking like I never had before. I felt so much negative energy and decided I was too scared to stay outside, so we went to the car and sat inside, praying whatever made that noise didn''t come back. My brother described the sound as sounding like someone ripping a tent. Whatever the noise was, absolutely no common animal could have made it. After a sleepless night, when it got light out again around 5:30, we built up the courage to go back where we heard the noise to see if there were any indications of what made it. And when we got there, I was shocked. There was a makeshift bed made from giant leaves that was fit for a very large creature. I could see the exact spot where the thing that had made the noise was watching me, and where it walked away, as there was a clear path of flattened grass and plants leading up the forest. The area was wet and muddy, and indeed there were footprints. But, as I was taking pictures the path leading from the bed to the upper forest, it happened again. The thing made the same exact noise, this time it was so close, I nearly fell. We ran back to our campsite and listened. But nothing made a sound. We stayed there for about 30 minutes until I decided to go back and see if there were fresh prints or anything I could take back as proof. I took more pictures, and i was standing on the trail leading back to our campsite looking at the pictures I had taken when again, the thing made the same noise! This time it was on the side of me that I would have to run past it to get back to the campsite. As soon as I heard it, it felt like my heart literally dropped and my legs became wobbly, but I summed up my courage and once again ran back to the campsite in fear. It was only about 10 seconds away, and when I got there my brother was standing there wide eyed asking if I had heard the noise. Whatever it was, it was not happy and we heard it walk up into the forest breaking branches and exhaling aggressively as it headed deeper into the forest. At this point my brother wanted to get the heck out of there, but I needed to see it. I went up to the road right before the forest where we had heard it go in, and looked around, but saw nothing. I was so confused on how the heck it ever got so close to me without me seeing or hearing it walk at all. While I was walking on the road, I saw my brother walk up from the campsite looking around. When he spotted me, he sighed in relief and told me he though I was getting attacked because he heard a bunch of human like screams coming from the forest. I walked towards where he was and started to hear them too, but by the time I reached him the screams started to sound like some kind of weird chatter. My brother, the skeptic, was so scared he told me were packing up and leaving right away. I have no doubt in my mind that we just happened to pick a campsite right next to where a Sasquatch was sleeping, and he was just not happy about that. I know what we heard was a Sasquatch. My brother entered a skeptic, but left a full believer in Bigfoot. ",

It was very dark and as I was walking past Stephens State Park and then the old Saxton Falls area, I could hear something that sounded like it was on 2 feet stalking me in the woods on the ridge side of Waterloo Rd. It got very interesting when I started sprinting, it also started sprinting keeping up with me for what seemed like at least a mile. When I would walk, it would walk. It was loud as it went thru the woods as I stayed on the road hoping for a car to pick me up. Eventually I did get a ride near a few houses after passing an old Tavern on the river side of Waterloo Rd. ",

    " Have been out scouting research locations for snake studies on google earth and found an area that we really wanted to check out which was an open paleodune ridge that offered plenty of basking/nesting habitat that the snakes we were researching liked to use. The hike there was pretty rough, walking through knee deep wetlands at points and wrestling with tangles of greenbrier and other thorny bushes to get to the location which was about a mile and a half back into the woods. Upon finally arriving at the site we were able to settle down and start looking for good spots that the snakes we were looking for used. As we were walking up one of the ridge fingers, we came upon an abandoned hunting stand that looked like it could be used as a shelter. I was a little unnerved because we didnt really wanna run into someone out there especially if they werent expecting company. <BR>As I was looking around my friend went back behind me to look around or use the bathroom while I continued to look. <BR>I began to hear bipedal walking in the swamp below us, what sounded like sticks breaking and snapping. I was pretty freaked out thinking it was a hunter so I yelled down at it saying hello? Anyone there?. No response as I continued to look I saw part of a dark figure go tree from tree. Long enough to know I wasnt imagining it, but not long enough to identify shape, size and detail. My memory fails to remember exactly how tall off the ground it was but the encounter lasted several seconds, from when I first heard the walking, saw the dark flash and when it subsequently disappeared or stopped in the swamp. After this I rounded up my friend and we headed out of there pretty quickly not knowing if a nearby hunter was there or worse, some crazy dude was stalking us. <BR>A few days went by before I really began to realize what I could have seen and it just made little sense that someone was out there  messing with us. <BR>Have since returned to the location to look some things over, large game trails surround the dune. But other than that, not much further evidence was able to be found.",

    " The town of Cranbury, NJ held fireworks on July 5th this year (2000). My wife, our two children (ages 6 and 2), and I had driven from our nearby town to watch the fireworks from our vehicle. When the fireworks ended (shortly after 10:00 PM) we decided to take a short drive. We headed North on Rt. 535, and although it was a warm night we still had our windows down because of the fireworks. After approximately one mile, as we were passing a stand of trees on our left (speed was approximately 50 mph) I could make out a shrieking sound coming from outside. After we had passed I slowed down and asked my wife if she had heard the sound. She said that she had heard it, but with the noise from the wind rushing through the windows it hadn''t registered. <BR><BR>I decided that the sound was too odd and urgent to ignore, so I made a U-turn at the next possible point and slowly made my way back to the section of road where the sound came from. As we approached the stand of trees (now on my right), we began to hear the shrieking sound again. I stopped the vehicle near to the point where the sound was coming from. The shrieks would last about 4 or 5 seconds with a one or two second pause in between. Our immediate impression was that it was like a young woman in sheer terror or agony. After a very brief moment we decided that no, it sounded more like a hawk or an eagle. Then, again we thought it could be human, because it was just too powerful to be coming from a small animal. <BR><BR>Unable to determine what the sound was, I decided to honk the horn to see what the reaction would be. There was no change in the shrieking so we decided that there probably wasn''t a crime in progress, because the perpetrator would probably have stopped, or the victim would have intensified or vocalized their pleas. At this point about 20 seconds had passed since we had returned to the area. The sounds seemed to be coming from the far edge of the trees, about 15 yards away, so we were unable to see where they were coming from because of the dark. We decided that to determine if something or someone was in danger or hurt I should step out and yell into the trees to see if the shrieking would stop, which I did armed with my sons wooden baseball bat. The first time I hollered the shrieking faltered and the second time I hollered the sounds stopped altogether. Total elapsed time since returning to the site was probably less than 30 seconds.<BR><BR>I got back in the vehicle and we waited several minutes and the sound didn''t continue. We went for a short drive and stopped at the area a few minutes later but we didn''t hear the sound again. My wife and I have discussed the incident several times and have never come up with a satisfactory explanation as to what could have made those sounds.<BR><BR>I grew up in Canada, where I spent most of my summers camping in the wilderness, so I can easily identify most animal sounds and responses. This creature didn''t seem to behave like an animal would when approached by a vehicle, a horn, or myself, until I hollered extremely loud two times. The sound was distressed, extremely loud, bordered on human, but was definitely not human, and I have no explanation for it. <BR><BR>",

The only thing I can say for sure is, it really did happen and I will do my best to portray the event as I remember it. <BR>  I grew up in a middle size town, a few miles from both the Jersey shore and the edges of the Pine Barrens.  My neighborhood & town were undergoing a growth spurt and wooded areas where I played as a kid were now strip malls or homes.  My house was on a corner lot and the neighbors house directly in front was a summer cottage (they were not there at the time).  I was 18 in 1989 and recently graduated from high school, with a strict midnight curfew.  My friend dropped me off on time with the passenger side of the car facing the front of my house.  I was outside of the car talking to Scott through the passenger side window, when we both heard a rustling sound near the trees on the corner of my neighbors property, about 30 feet away.  There was a street light on the opposite corner, and I could not make anything out beyond it.  We didnt think much of it and continued to talk.  The rustling returned a little louder, and with a sound that I remember as something being dragged on concrete such as a stick.  <BR><BR>At this point I asked Scott if he saw anything over there.  At first he replied no, then he hesitated and said he sees something like a big dog that is sitting by the trees.  Not wanting to be bit by some rabid dog, I got in the car.  We went up the road and turned the car around on the opposite intersection.  Once around, we were facing my house, and there was what appeared to be a large grayish dog directly under the street lamp.  We started moving very slowly towards my house, and as we got closer it really didnt appear to be like any dog I had every scene before.  When we were about 50 feet away, I turned to Scott and asked him to turn on the high-beams.  It is here where things happened very quickly, and I will try to capture it as best I can.  To our horror, what we thought was a large dog stood up and began to run on two legs.  It crossed the car and ran on an angle at first towards the middle of my house, but then quickly changed course and went around the dark side of my house.  We were both yelling, what the h**l, was that repeatedly.  The creature was very tall, his head was taller then the top of the windows on the house so I estimate around 8-feet.  He appeared to be a light gray in color, but it could have been the lights reflecting off his hair.  His arms were long and lanky, and sort of swayed forward and aft as he ran.  The creature had amazing speed/agility, and ran with what one would consider to be an odd gait.  His head was tilted forward and he might have been slightly hunched over.  His head swayed between looking forward and looking at us.  I will never forget the way his eyes reflected in the headlights.  The total time we had eyes on the creature was between 3-5 seconds.  Once he disappeared, the car accelerated around the corner and Scott slammed on the brakes.  Expecting to see the creature in the headlights, there was nothing but dark road..he was gone.  <BR><BR>Not wanting to get out of the car we proceeded to Scotts house a few miles away.  After a quick phone conversation with my parents, they ordered me home.  They were waiting out front when we got there, and we tried to explain what we saw.  My parents would hear none of our tale and assumed we were either drunk, or on drugs.  We were both rather shaken by the event, and my parents began to question their original assessment.  Over time came the inevitable ridicule of family and friends, and with their mocking I never really wanted to discuss this with anyone again.           <BR><BR>It took years before I was comfortable being alone, especially at night.  After spending time in the military, I came to the realization that he was as scared of us, as we were of him.  While I no longer have the fear, there isnt a day that has gone by without me thinking of that night.                  <BR>",

    " 2 weeks ago i went into the pine barrons in manchester nj ,deep in forest to shoot a pistol. i left the gun in the car and scoped out the area before i started shooting. i started down a trail and when i turned the corner i heard heavy heavy footsteps run away from me and smell a skunky/homeless person type oder. i looked around area but saw nothing. then i walked in another direction and found a stream or pond.  then something threw a rock into the water making a good size splash. i now went back to the truck and got my gun when i went back to the trail. i saw nothing but thought this might be a bigfoot. couldnt stop thinking about it so i went back a couple days later with a bigger gun and an axe. when i got to the spot where this hapened i heard a loud call like choom choom choom choom. this startled me and i cocked the hammer. i then heard footsteps coming tawards me in the thick vegitation. it came within 15 feet away and stopped. i could not see it through the brush. with my gun pointed in its direction it threw a large stick that landed along side of me.  i said \"hello ?\"  any body there, but no reply. i almost emptyed the gun into the bush but desided not to because i cuoldnt see the creature. i could smell it ,feel it, here it, and it threw something at me twice! i backed off and walked back to my truck the whole time ready to shoot if it atacked me.when i reached the truck this thing let out another call only much louder and much closer choom choom many times. a small bird on a tree branch began to act crazy. i took this warning and left. this sunday i went back with food, i took food to the spot where it threw the stick and backed away. then i heard some vocalizeations and got one of them on mini disc recording. sounds kinda like / coo coo kaa kaakaa coo coo ka kakka. went back to the trail to see if food was gone and was met by more stange bird behavior. many birds fleww rapidly out of trail as if some thing scared them out. when i looked down the trail i heard a loud snap of a tree or branch being broken. i backed away and soon after heard some low moans and groans, much too low to be a person. i also smelled the same oder again. this thing has an exeptional abilty to hide. all three times it was very close to me but for some reason i could not see it. i am convinced this is a sasqatch or more than one of them. i can take you or researchers to this place in nj pine barrons. this story is not a hoax and i dont beleive a person would be dumb enough to throw sticks and rocks at a man with a gun! i saw alot of good size trees (5or6inchdiameter) broken in half.",

    " <BR>In mid July, I was sitting at my computer at night, playing a computer game, with the television on behind me.  I was watching my sister''s dog while they were on vacation, and she was laying down in the other room.  At perhaps 7pm or 8pm I heard a howl in the distance, very far behind my house.  This is not uncommon, since there is a heavily wooded area where there are hills, and bears often live in the area.  A call from a mother to a cub is not unheard of, especially in evening hours.  <BR><BR>I made sure the dog was in the house and then went to the back and shut the back door.  I was not scared of anything getting in, but the dog often will run through a screen door to get to honking geese passing by, a neighbors dog or even a rabbit if it sees one in the back yard.  I heard the same, distant howl again a few minutes later and dismissed it.<BR><BR>I went back and played my video games for another hour, and then I heard the sound again, but it chilled me more so then I can ever explain in words to another.  The noise was not a bear, nor could any bear ever make such a sound  Bears make sounds which are deep and even grunting, however this was one that can only be described as a ''screaming howl.''  <BR><BR>What shook me so much, was that the sound litteraly was just outside my window, perhaps 20 feet or so, and was so loud, I litteraly almost fell out of my seat, it shocked me so baddly.  In the summer my windows are open, but to discourage bugs I keep the blinds closed.  My window is perhaps 8 feet off the ground on the side of the house, just to give a feel for the area.  <BR><BR><BR>Immediately my heart raced so fast, it hurt.  I knew for a fact, all I had to do was draw the blinds open and I could see what it was, since it was still light out, yet I could not.  I was paralyzed for the first and only time in my life.  I waited, expecting to hear the sound again, yet did not.  Finally after about a minute, I went out of my room and went into a more central room in the house trying to get away fom the sound, yet I would be damned if I would go near one of the screen doors.  In my parents room I found my sisters dog, and this animal, who usualy will bark and growl at anything, was laying in a corner, curled up and it had deficated all over the floor.  As soon as it saw me it just whimpered.  I closed the door and I myself sat down near it and waited for perhaps 10 minutes and after that, finally gathered enough courage to shut and lock all the doors, and didn''t hear or see anything afterwards.  The dog refused to come out of the room the entire night.<BR><BR>I am a 23 year old male who is 6 feet tall and 260 lbs, yet I was terrified plain and simple.  I had no idea what it was, and I still do not to this day.  I did not tell my parents of relatives, because they will simply say it was a bear, and perhaps it was, but I have NEVER heard a bear, nor any other animal make such a sound before.  ",

I pulled up to the house adjacent to the road leaving the truck running and lights on. I could smell a skunk like smell but thought nothing of it. I loaded the machine on the trailer, chained down one side crossed in front of the truck and noticed red eyes at about 75-100 ft down the road looking back at me they seemed taller than 6'' , just out of range of head lights. I quickly got the other side truck and chained the other side down and ran back to cab of the truck and saw the same eyes stairing back. I got into the cab and told the other person with me I had seen something. I looked up and the eyes had moved off into woods to the left. My problem was there was no way to back down the road and I had to trough where this thing was standing. I started the truck up the hill past the point I had seen the eyes and continued past to the in the road and prayed I could 10 point turn this thing turned around and get out of there. Upon pulling onto the side road and backing up and trying to get the truck turned around I saw those eyes 30 ft off into the woods looking back at me, eye level. This truck is a medium duty international 1954 series eye level is about 7 ft. I got the truck into gear and started down the road as fast as I could. Not looking back until I was several miles down the road. I told my friend I saw bear or wolve as to not alarm them.

    " I had parked my Volkswagen beetle at the junction of Rte. 17A and the Appalachian Trail, intending to camp out overnite along the trail.  I then hiked south on the trail about 4 miles, along a ridge that overlooks Greenwood Lake until I was perhaps just above the New Jersey line.  Since I had hiked this section of trail before I knew of an ideal camping site - a large outcropping of bedrock that rises about 10 feet above the surrounding terrain, and has a sheer drop off on the west side with a small swampy area on that side.  I unrolled my sleeping bag and bedded down as soon as it got dark, enjoying the magnificent view of the sky before dozing off.  About midnight I awoke for some unknown reason, and shortly after heard the most horrifying high pitched scream I had ever heard out in the woods, perhaps a 100 yards to my southeast.  I scrambled out of my sleeping bag, and quickly put my boots on.  Then the scream repeated itself, and I was positively terrified, as I knew it was miles in the dark to my car, and I had only a small flashlight.  Thinking to scare off, what I assumed was an animal, I screamed back at it, and was aghast when it returned my scream.  Several more screams were exchanged and then silence.  With my heart racing, I gathered up all the stones I could find in depressions in the rock I was camping on, and began throwing them in the direction the loud scream originated.  Then, to my horror, another scream came from a direction south-southwest of me, which astonished me as I heard no noise of movement, and in those days had extremely good hearing.  I hurled rocks in this direction, with more screams being exchanged.  This process went on for another hour, and then quiet, but I stayed up all night.  In the morning I checked the area where the noise had originated, and discovered it was covered with dry leaves, which made me more puzzled why I heard no noise. ",

    " My sister and her two children, my wife and I and our two dogs went to Nuclear lake in Dutchess county for an overnight camping trip. We set up camp in a field next to the lake a few hundred feet off the applician trail. We had two tents and went in them to sleep around 11:00p.m. My sister was feeling uneasy so I sent my male dog to her tent to sleep with her and the kids. My older dog, my wife, and myself were in my tent. I turned the opening of my tent to face my sisters tent door so she felt less stressed. An hour went by and the kids my old dog and wife were sleeping. Suddenly I heard foot steps coming from the woods heading toward us. It was a very dark night but I saw no flashlight shine. Then my young dog in my sisters tent started to make this whine/growl and I could clearly hear a person walk behind my sisters tent, but still no flashlight shine! All the while my sister was awake and my young dog freaking out almost crying and he is a pitbull not afraid of any critter. I KNEW it was a bigfoot and told my sister not to worry because she hates the woods and couldnt sleep. The next morning she looked very tired and we only spoke about it a month later on the phone. She said she knew it was a biped and couldnt sleep all night. My wife, my two dogs and I are trail runners and twice a week do 6 mile runs on this section of the Appalacian trail. It is remote and rugged and I have Moose dropping on my fireplace mantle from that area and bear sightings are common. A few miles up the trail is a large beautiful swamp also. This is not my first time I had the feeling bigfoot was around. My wife and I are in the woods more then anyone I know. We hike and back pack all summer and log 25 miles a week in the woods trail running. I made a report a few years ago when we were hiking up Buck mountain when a bigfoot was smashing trees and making that loud click noise like I can do with my tounge but 10 times louder. I know a woman who had a daytime visual in st. lawrence county n.y. and I also know a man who had a visual in penn. when he was hunting deer. What is the real story on bigfoot. Are they so slick that no one can get a good picture or do they just scare people so much that the powers that be dont want the cat out of the bag. I wont go in the deep woods alone anymore and I was never afraid but now I am and hate that feeling. I''ll give my name and number and I sure wish someone would call me. thanks.",

So we asked them to stop but nobody responded we proceeded to head into shore when we noticed another big splash. So then we stopped and we noticed a foul smell, like a wet animal. We then looked towards the bushes and a tall thin tree was shaking very fast back and forth. Then we noticed a big bolder thrown through the air toward us, it hit the water. That''s when we realized what the splashing was.Then we noticed a man like figure with red beady eyes when we flashed the light at the bushes about 2 feet above the bushes was the eyes.

We foolishly figured it wuld be an hour up and and hour back and we''d be home by supper and didn''t take a flashlight. It took 2 hours up and the sun was beginning to wane. Now my husband had a habit of walking very fast sometimes out of my sight and I kept yelling, almost crying,\" Wait ,wait for me!\"As it got near dusk, the road was darker and darker and I finally grabbed and held on to his arm so I wouldn''t be left alone and behind. Then we heard something big crunching up the ground just off the road in the woods beside us and following along with us.If we stopped, it stopped. I couldn''t tell if it was one or more but I think just one. aAll down the Mtn until we got to where the road kind of levels out for at least an hour or more that thing was in the woods following.He figured it was deer or a bear but would those animals do that?

    " On June 10, 2006 I was driving with my brother on a back road (unpaved) in the Adirondack Park. We were heading for a trail head that led into the Hudson River Gorge. This area is almost dead center in the park and surounded by many mile of unihabited and very rugged terrain. <BR><BR>It was late morning on a clear day. I was driving as fast as i could on this road because we had to get back to town by a certain time.<BR><BR>As we turned a bend I saw a very large, brown, furry, object lunge into the dense woods up the road at the next curve about 50 yards ahead. It was obvious that the creature was in the road and was startled by my speeding SUV.  <BR><BR>I told by brother, \"Hey, there goes a moose.\"<BR><BR>We reached that spot in about 3 seconds, and i slamed on the breaks - expecting to see the moose right there in the bushes.<BR>At that spot, through the bushes, was a decent sized clearing and then more dark woods that went down a hill.<BR><BR>There was nothing there at all. Everything was still. We started off again and took our hike.<BR><BR>The more I thought about it, the more I thougth I just could not have been a moose.<BR><BR>First of all it was the wrong color - a light chestnut bown. (The color was very visible because the sun was shinning in the area. It was a striking shade against the ligth green of the brush.) Moose are never that shade - they are always a very dark brown.<BR><BR>Second, the size and shape were wrong. This thing was huge - at least 7 feet tall. And the shape was not like a Moose rump. The more I thght about it, the more it seemed like it was the upper back and head of something.<BR><BR>Finaly, if it was a moose, it would not have utterly vanished so quickly. My vehicke got to that spot in just seconds. Moose, at least the ones that I have seen, don''t tear off into the wood. We should have seen it in the clearing.<BR><BR>It wan''t a bear, either.

    " My memory of this is a bit foggy, as I was I believe seven when it happened and am 37 now. At the time my family was living in Cazenovia NY. I would often hike way out in the swamps behind our house with a friend to make forts etc. We would tear the bark off of dead elm trees to make paths for what seemed like very long distances. One day a friend and I were quite a distance out in the swamp chopping away at a rotted fallen tree with hammers when we heard a loud noise. Looking around we saw a very large, dark form that appeared to be a man walking through the swamp very near us. I will never forget the surge of adrenalin and abject fear that I felt. We dropped everything and turned and ran as fast as possible home without looking back. My parents were angry as I had left a hammer there. I refused to go back for quite a while until my older brother accompanied me. I didn''t think about this incident too much over the years until later when I have heard people describe bigfoot sightings in terms of ''It looked like a very big man wearing a black raincoat''. This is exactly the description I would give. I don''t know, it just seems odd. Why would a man have been alone out in a swamp like that and never said a word to us? Makes you wonder.",

    " This is a follow up to my original message as I wanted to add some significant insight to an incident that occurred to me in 1960 at age 14. As I stated previously stated I was a caddy at the time and the foursome I was with was just walking off the green of hole 13 on the private course Club in Syracuse, New York.  As I was walking across the green to replace the pin I heard something falling through a tree directly across from me. You could hear it pass through the tree as the boulder made its descent to the ground. The large rock almost hitting one of the golfers. There was much consternation over this and it was automatically assumed that it came as a result of blasting at General Crushed Stone located behind the golf course on Rock Cut Road. I never heard a blast but there could be no other explanation as large rocks don''t just fall out of the sky. However, the rock being hurled into the air by a dynamite blast at the quarry just doesn''t hold up in many ways. First off my friend''s father worked at the quarry at the time and he said blasting was not large enough to propel a single rock that far as the charges used to quarry the limestone were not that great. Plus this was a single large boulder if it was a blast there would be a shotgun type of pattern of smaller rocks with it, not just one rock sailing into the air. Secondly, the rock that I saw was not a freshly quarried rock which would be gray in color this rock was a surficial rock that was stained from the soil it did not come from a blast site. The boulder was at least 20 pounds in weight and 4\" by 8\" and 3\" thick. It was flat on the top and bottom and stained a yellow brown color as is common of rocks on the surface in that area. However, this rock came down out of the sky vertically as you could tell by the sound of it falling through the entire tree, cutting branches and leaves as it fell it had to have been lifted quite high into the air to come down vertically like it did. It did not smash into the tree on a horizontal trajectory and bounce off the tree. As I stated previously at the end of the game I met up with my friend  who lived on Rock Cut Road at the time as we were going swimming in the spring fed wash ponds at the quarry. The way to get there was to go back to hole 13 and cross the fence into General Crushed Stone property. We were trespassing which at the time we didn''t acknowledge.  We stopped and I showed my friend the rock that came out of the sky and both of us believed that it had to have been a blast at the quarry.  We walked on down a grade on a path and that is when we heard a guttural growl off to our left. It was a fearsome growl and I for one shot off down the hill as fast as I could go. We assumed it was an animal. However, what animal growls at a human when the human is not confronting it or even knows it is there? I don''t know of any and I certainly don''t know what type of animal living in Central New York would or could make itself know in a threatening manner. Normally animals of all type will shun and form of human contact or confrontation. This occurred no more than 100 feet from where the rock had landed under the tree. Plus if you were to place a clock face over the tree that the rock fell through and draw a line out from where the rock had landed which was between the 3 and the 5 those two lines would encompass the vicinity of where the growl came from. As I have stated I never saw anything out of the ordinary and was certainly not aware of \"Bigfoot\" or anything like it being seen in New York State. I had heard of the \"Abominable Snowman\" but that was worlds away. I can''t say this is a \"Bigfoot\" encounter, however, two events occurred that is very similar to what others have experienced in Bigfoot sightings. The large rock being hurled at individuals and done so to scare more than injury plus the deep growl the likes of which I had never heard before or since and couldn''t to this day equate it to one particular animal. The only thing I am sure of is two events separated in time by only a couple of hours still stand out in my mind these many years later as if they occurred today.  ",

    " The town of Albion is small, there are woods, fields & streams just on the outskirts of town. With the time being around 2:00am in the morning, there were no sounds of any traffic or industrial sounds. The weather was excellent; no clouds, not the slightest breeze. My girlfriend and I had turned in for bed at around 1:30-1:45 am. We were talking to each other, just little chit chat when we both heard a far off howl/moan! At that time of night and that there was no wind to disturb the trees and hamper what we heard, it sounded like it came from the south maybe a mile or a mile and a half. The sound started low and kept going up in pitch for about 5 seconds. We both looked at each other and said \"What the hell was that?!\" Now what really freaked us out is that it did it again, only at around 6-7 seconds! It was like, \"Ooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh-----\"<BR>   Now I consider myself an excellent observer with a very keen ear. I can hear things that most people either don''t, or just overlook. What we heard was NOT anything mechanical nor was it a whistle. It sounded like it traveled over some distance; not like it was down the street. I am very fimiliar with all kinds of traffic noises that are associated with small towns. Even before we had heard it, we both had noticed how silent it was for quite some time.<BR>   After the howl/moan, there was an echo. The sound went up in scale and didn''t go down like a siren or anything like that. It wasn''t a cry for help or a wolf nor any coyote (I have heard a coyote three times, once from only 200 yards)",

    " First let me state I am a college educated person with two degrees.  One in psychology and one in fine art.  Like many persons who have had this type of unexplained experience, it has made a mark on my psyche that has been permanently etched despite the ridicule poured on me (by persons who in fact were not there). Scientifically one may NOT deny or affirm the existence of a thing about which we have little information.  For instance, in the 1600''s if one were to speak of electricity and television they would be deemed mad and a witch.  Now you read this by just such means as were previously thought non-sense.  We know it is fact now.  Some day, I believe, this rare ape will present us with irrefutable evidence of it''s existence like being a little too slow in front of a mack truck or something.  Enough of that.<BR>Here''s why you''re reading this...<BR><BR>In the winter of 2001 while surfing the net for images of \"western art paintings\" the BFRO web site popped up with Western New York Bigfoot Sightings.  I had to laugh.  You gotta be kidding me.  Then to make it even better there are these \"listen to the bigfoot\" wave/sound files to download.  So curiousity made me do it.  I''m laughing my butt off here.  So I hit play.  <BR><BR>Suddenly I shut up  -   I am in SHOCK.  My hands began to shake and the adrenaline glands almost blew my head off.  The sound of the \"howl\" is exactly what I encountered one evening the previous September of 2000.  So now I play the other \"scream\" file.  Alright, now I''m disturbed.  That too I heard within 100 yards of my home that same summer, about 5-6 times on different occasions.<BR><BR>I never had any thoughts about sasquatch before.  This gave me pause.  It suddenly gave me a flashback of living near the Tonawanda creek in upstate New York and seeing a large (12-15\") barefoot footprint in the snow along the creek/riverbank just upstream of the north pembroke hotel(magadore hilton,ha).  Barefoot in the snow ? What kind of a jerk does that ?  There were, I believe, four of us kids there.  I was about 11 or 12 at the time.  We often played in those woods however that day we had an uneasy feeling and cut our trip very short and went immediately home.  I thought maybe it was a bear track like a hind foot although I knew it was too human.  No one even mentioned Bigfoot, it was not something we ever talked about.  Now that memory is freaky.<BR><BR>And there''s more..<BR>I now live in the woods and am very comfortable here near Allegeny State Park.  There are literally thousands of acres of forrest surrounding my home.  I am comfortable chasing 350 pound black bears out of my yard, sitting in the woods and having coyotes walk by, hearing screach owls etc.  THIS sound was unlike anything I had ever heard.  Sometimes at the approach of archery season I need to convince disrespectful persons that no tresspassing actually means them.  This night I thought to encounter a coon hunter whose howling dog was moving towards my position down through the valley.  The sound wasn''t just right for a baying dog but what else could it be ???  Now at the time this howling started it was probably a mile off (more later) and at dusk/dark.<BR><BR> I have the pleasure of having a wolf-dog that is not too much pooch you might say.  Great animal, very mellow even when on walks at night and the coyotes start up yapping less that 100yrs away.  He just looks and say''s \"punks\" and moves on - nothing phases him.  This night he was like stone focused on the direction of the loooooong howl.( I get the creeps remembering it).  Never before or since have I seen him in that state even in the presence of black bears.  His ears were fixed and I had to drag him under protest back into my cabin.  I was afraid that he might attack an expensive coon dog when I confronted the ''hunter''.  So now the wolf is in the house and I leash up my german sheperd, grab a spot light and a very serious russian weapon.  I take off in the direction of this howl which I can tell is coming toward me and know there is a field which leads up into the woods near where we should meet.  I get about 80 yrds in that direction and notice that the howling is now going to pass above me in the woods so I redirect my course for a more appropriate intersection point.<BR> <BR>Normally my sheperd is pretty bloodthirsty which I do not encourage, just her nature.  Tonight she is cowering between my legs trying to pull me back home to safety.  I''m thinkin'' \"wimp dog !!!\" and she''s really making me angry.  I am looking for the coon hunter''s tell tale spot light in the tree tops or through the woods -nothing.  Meanwhile I have entered into the thick of the woods cresting an embankment of about 35 feet above the road.  Oh Boy !  That aint no dog.  What the ----- weapon''s up laser sight on - this is bad.  When you have an attack dog, a nasty weapon with o so many bullets and a spot light (which started to go out, thankyou very much) and you''re still scared.  You just make sure the safety is off and focus on that little red dot.  <BR><BR> The thing was traveling at such a speed through the woods it didn''t seem real.  I thought the dog had to be running but when I heard it from around 120 yards away on the same level, NOBODY could convince you it was a dog, wolf, coyote etc.<BR>  I don''t scare easy, that was terror.<BR>Still I never thought \"bigfoot\".  In fact I researched all the wolf sounds I could find and none of them matched what I heard the night before.  I thought that is why my critter was so interested.<BR>  I just chalked it up to a \"maybe wolf\".  A neighbor who is about 85% deaf and a true hermit woodsman (83 years old) asked ME if I heard \"that howling the other night\".  This guy could almost sleep through an atomic bomb. Another fellow who is a Korean war vet who saw too much action also told me about this strange howling he heard two seperate nights.  He stated that he intentionally stayed up one night to see if he could figure out what it was.  He said that he could never figure out the noise or creature that made it.  Understand that this guy has camped out in a tent or camper in these woods for over 15 years.  Frankly he''s seen or heard almost everything around here.  Yet another neighbor ask me about the noise.  Her first comment was,\"It seemed a lot louder than it should have.\"  Now know that she owns a kennel and is an accomplished singer musician.  Let''s just say she understands acoustics.  Incidentally there is a great deer trail just about where I believe this noisy beast to have traversed the valley.<BR>",

''If it''s a hoax, someone did a good job...''<BR><BR>By Melanie Conty<BR>The Corning Leader<BR>--------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>Rathbone - Bigfoot may be stomping around town, according to people who found huge footprints, hairs and uprooted vegetation near an area pond, area residents suspect.<BR><BR>Officials at the New York state Department of Environmental Conservation and Cornell University are examining the findings, and said they do not know who or what they''re from.<BR><BR>\"If it''s a hoax, then someone did a pretty good job of setting this thing up,\" said Michael McKeon, a DEC spokesman in Albany. \"And if it''s not a hoax, then we''ll have to see if Bigfoot''s out there.\"<BR><BR>The prints were each 15 inches long, five inches wide and embedded at least an inch in the mud, McKeon said.<BR><BR>They were spaced over 40 inches apart and casts taken showed bunions on the feet.<BR><BR>McKeon said he didn''t believe the claims at first, but now is not so sure.<BR><BR>Nellie Ferry of 6788 Hardscrabble Road spotted the prints Aug. 9, when she and her husband, Joe, were fishing at a neighbor''s pond.<BR><BR>A few days later more showed up, and then on Wednesday more appeared on the pond''s other side.<BR><BR>\"I''m not saying (Bigfoot) is what this thing is, but we''re trying to get an idea,\" Ferry said.<BR><BR>\"The DEC said it''s not human, but it''s not an animal.\"<BR><BR>Neighbors in this rural area about six miles outside Addison say they are intrigued and a bit anxious about the situation.<BR><BR>They report hearing noises - and sometimes a stench - coming from the remote pond.<BR><BR>\"My daughter rides her horse up there,\" said one woman.<BR><BR>\"That''s our back yard.

Now, I don''t feel so safe.\"<BR><BR>Many of the neighbors don''t want their names used.<BR>\"People will think we are crazy,\" she said.<BR><BR>Friends and area libraries have been providing Ferry with books and videotapes on Bigfoot, who has been spotted throughout the United States since the 1940s. A narrator of one videotape claimed to show actual footage of his Bigfoot sighting. The animal was about 8 feet tall, 400 pounds and extremely hairy. Others on the tape said Bigfoot has a pointed head, red eyes and looks \"like the devil.\"<BR><BR>The species is believed to exist on fresh fish and vegetation, and there has been no evidence that it eats red meat. Wolves allegedly roll around on its footprints and are quite receptive towards its stench, described as a combination of sewage and musty, wet cloth.<BR><BR>Sightings have been in Alaska, California, Vermont, and Florida, and upstate New York, the last here in the Adirondacks in 1972. Believers say about 1,200 Bigfoot exist in the United States.<BR><BR>Ferry said whatever has been walking around the pond has pulled up cat tails and eaten their roots, and lately she has heard howling and other unusual sounds from the woods at night.<BR><BR>McKeon said he does not believe there is yet cause for alarm.<BR>\"It''s not something that we think is a real problem,\" he said. \"There''s no reason for people to panic.\"<BR><BR>This advice, however, did not calm Ferry. \"I am getting nervous over it,\"she said. \"I mean, I would like to see it to find out what it is.\"<BR><BR>",

    " It was during 1997, late summer or early fall and my mother and I were visiting my Grandmother upstate. It was about 10pm and we were sitting outside on the back deck looking at the stars and listening to the night. We had made sure all the outside lights were off so we could see the stars better. My mother was sitting on one of the benches facing the house, and I was sitting on the steps facing the back yard. It was so dark, I couldn'' see more than a foot or two beyond my own feet.  We had been out there for a little while, and had not been talking, so it was pretty quiet. Suddenly, from about 20 to 30 feet down the yard, there was the strangest noise I had ever heard. It was kind of a cross between a scream, grunt and a donkey brey, not overly loud, and lasted for about 5 seconds or so. A second or two later, it started again, only closer, so I jumped up to go in and turn on the light, but accidently let the door close. When I got the light on, nothing was there. I grabbed a flashlite and scanned the yard, but saw nothing. Mom and I just looked at each other and ran into the house! The next day, I went to where the noise had come from, but saw no evidence that anything had been there.",

    " My mother, brother, and I had recently moved to a secluded community on the outskirts of land known as White''s Woods. We moved in September, and it wasn''t until that summer that strange noises were heard. In July of ''96, at around 2:30am, no earlier than 2, never later than 3am, strange whistling could be heard from the woods at the fringe of the neighbourhood. It sounded like \"whooooOOOPPP, whooooOOOPPP,\" with the rise at the end of the whistle. It was a very high, shrill sound. My family and I are not outdoorsman, so I assumed it was a bird. It happened always in the early morning, several hours before dawn and always from the same location. We simply assumed it was a bird.<BR>     The following year, from July to August, always at the same time and in the same location, the whistles could be heard. This time, branches could be heard snapping. I went to school at the University of Pittsburgh. On campus, there lives a peregrine falcon, and I was lucky enough to see it take two pigeons, and there was a commotion when this happened. Assuming an owl took a rabbit, I took these occurances as eery yet explainable. However, what happened the following year is what gives me pause.<BR>     My brother and I, having put up with these sounds for two years, thought we would investigate if anything happened the third year. Sure enough, at 2:30am, in July of the third year, the whistler returned. My brother and I are fit men. He was 28 at the time and I was 30. We play a lot of baseball, so we grabbed our bats and headed out. there are no streetlights in the area. And once outside, the whistling seemed to fill the air. It was very loud and quite easy to pinpoint. About 100yds from our house, something was whistling amid the brush and trees. The height of the sound was about 7ft (high off the ground yet discernable to know it wasn''t coming from the trees). My brother and I investigated, baseball bats in hand. About 25yrds from the whistling, something strange happened. The whistling continued in it rhythmic, rising cadence, but as we approached, something growled underneath the whistle. I don''t know how else to discribe it. The whistle continued with a growl at the same time. The growl sounded wet and we were so close we could actually hear it take in air. The whistle growl sent us, baseball bats in hand, running for home.<BR>     The whistler returned the following year, but only once. We did not investigate. It hasn''t returned since. After the pre-emptive investigation, it came back only rarely. And now it seems to be gone.",

It was about 10:00 at night and my brother and I heard a noise that neither one of us has ever heard before. We grew up in the country and spent alot of time in the woods, even sleeping out with buddies when we were younger.Whatever it was was in the woods about 30 yards from us and it was screaming loudly and you could hear it breaking pretty good sized limbs. This went on for about 30 seconds or so, long enough for us to hustle to the cabin. I yelled for my dad and he came out on the porch and heard it as well. He said it was something he never heard either. We have combined 70 plus years hunting between us and none of us ever heard anything remotly like this before.

    " I will post my story, although I am not sure what it was that I heard.<BR><BR>I was counseling at a summer wilderness camp one summer after college and was up late one night talking with two campers and a co-counselor.  We were sitting in the middle of a dead-end dirt road, surrounded by a small farmer''s field, small lake and very thick woods and hills.  We heard a horrible screaming  coming from the woods next to the field, about 50 feet away.  We all jumped up and immediately shined out flashlights in the direction of the sound but did not see anything.  The night was too dark and our beams too dim.  The girls got scared and ran into the cabin to hide.  My co-counselor and I stood outside for about a 1/2 hour listening to the screams, which came at intervals throughout the entire time.  I have never heard anything like it.  It sounded like something screaming in death.  I cannot describe it; it was a very large sound.  I am an outdoorsperson and know the sounds that most animals make, and I had never heard anything like that before and had never heard anything since, until I was browsing around on your website and discovered your recorded sounds.  I downloaded the most recent scream (not the howl) and it sounded exactly like what I heard that night.  I listened to it over and over again to be sure that it was the same sound and although I am not certain what it was that we heard that night, it certainly is the same scream.  We heard it for only about a 1/2 hour that night; there were no answering screams.  I heard a similar scream about a week later from a distance away.  This time I was alone.  ",

    " My 7year old daughter and I decided to take my girlfriend out camping on the 4th of july weekend of 2007.My girlfriend had never been camping before and I wanted to give her the full effect.<BR>   I live in Warren Pa and that is in the Allegheny Forest. <BR>   We decided to camp out near the resivior by the Kinzua Dam. That first night, we were alone. Onebody near our site for atleast a quarter mile or more. Kat(my daughter) fell asleep and the two of us sat up and chatted. Off behind the tent, about 100 yards maybe closer, I heard a thud like a stick smacking a tree. Our yorkshire terrir heard it too. Then it was louder, more distinct like a base ball bat hitting a tree. My girlfriend was nervous, I could tell. I told her I had heard such a noise on a tape of Big Foot. She didn''t like that I said that and got alittle scared. I told her it would be ok and that whatever or whoever would not come near the firelight. She still was uneasy. We heard it for about 15 miinutes as it got further away from us.I thought I heard a weird howling too but I just chalked it up as a coyote or wolf. Though I have heard big foot howls and this did sound similar. I still wasn''t sure. All in all I figured it was telling us that this was his place and that we should not be here. <BR>  I had to lie to my girlfriend so she could sleep and said it was most likely a skunk or racoon. Though I know niether of those could hit a tree like that.<BR>   The next morning, I decided to look around and went out into the forest about 75 yards or more from the camp. I could still see the tent through the trees.<BR>  I found afew old logs broken over.A few trees in the distance looked bent over as if someone had done it by hand(typical sign of big foot markings) but I never told my girlfriend. We stayed another night there but we had very noisy campers about 80 yards up the road trying to fight with another camper about the noise they were making. <BR>This was last year. Now, I went on google earth and was looking at The Kinzua Dam In Warren Pa. I noticed an orange dot near the dam just passed it to the east I believe. I clicked on it and it said 1999-10-?? I tried the link and WHOAH!! was I excited... A big foot sighting right there!!! I loved it. <BR>   I am thinking on going back to the same place to camp this summer. Just myself, my girlfriend, my daughter and our dog. I love it out there. even if it does creep my girlfriend out lol.. There is something about big foot that makes me want to hear or see more. maybe even capute it on film or video.",

We arrived at a campsite about 7:15pm and as we were sitting on a picnic table, we looked out over a small pond and noticed a leaf on a tree fluttering very fast, as if someone was intentionally doing it. There was absolutely no wind at all. To the right of this leaf was a very large black mass moving back and forth methodically. It was between a couple of medium size trees, blocking out the background behind it. The sun was hitting the exact spot, and you could clearly see a large black mass of at least 7 feet tall, and 4 feet wide just swaying back and forth...we both witnessed this from about 30 yards or less, and my wife said the face looked like a gorillas...all I could focus on was the immense size of the body...this is not the first time we had encountered something.

Personally I didn''t believe or didn''t want to believe what I had just heard. But within minutes we all heard the 2nd knock and were all speechless in what we had just heard. After talking about it for a couple minutes we heard another but this time it came from the other side of the river, speechless yet again we all just looked at each other and within seconds we heard another but this time it was right being us and close. That''s when we knew we had to leave.  As we were packing our fishing poles in the car we heard 4 loud aggressive knocks within 30 yards of were we parked. We immediately showed the poles in the car and left.  After getting several miles down the road we stopped and said let''s go back and try and get it on video because know one would believe us.

    "Just noting that my friend spent the night before at the campsite alone and felt very uneasy.Part of the reason I am reporting this is due to the existing report about the Kennard Dale students in southern end of the county. I don''t remember hearing about those sightings while they were happening in those years. I do remember on the back page of The York Dispatch (now defunct)a picture of a state trooper (I believe) standing almost spread-eagled with his crotch just above the snow with his legs stretched out in some melted out prints that were found in the snow down in that area. I think the year was 1978 for some reason not earlier seventies. Maybe you can confirm this. Some alegged the prints were Sasquatch . I rememeber he (the trooper) was grinning into the camera because he could only just barely match the stride of tracks. If I remember right I believe there was an accompaning story about a local high school teacher taking students out on a field trip and haviing rocks rolled or thrown at them from an unknown assailant from an above forested ridge area.",

    " Hello,<BR><BR>My name is Doug and though I am very reluctant to post this story; I am going to do so anyways. The area that this happened  could not be a more unlikely area for a bigfoot occurance then or  especially now with all the development of the farmland in the last 25 years which has been extensive and at a phenominal rate. After reading many (if not every last report on this website) and coming across more that a few that have happened in improbable areas (bigfoot running down neighborhood streets and sightings/ vocalizations near condo areas), I decided there just might be some merit in submitting this for review. A skilled researcher might be able to shed some more light maybe.<BR><BR>My friends parents owned a small somewhat defunct farm with (I''m guessing maybe 15-20 acres of land -not the best judge on that) They had 3 horses; 2 mares that were allowed out in the field areas; a stabled stallion, and a pony I believe. The barn was in dis-repair and part of the roof had collapsed years earlier. There was a large pond that was almost completely enclosed with an impenatrable thicket of briars ringing almost the whole cirmcuference of the pond, except for a small area that was kept open for access for the horses to water. Much of the property was overgrown with these same briars that tended to make big circular mounds here and there in the field. The house sat close to the road; the barn to the left and further behind. The extreme left side of their property was bordered by a small stream that edged along a small (100 ft x 30 ft) stand of very dense pine trees. These pines (species unknown) tend to have a very dense understory of almost horizontal dead, dry, branches due to years of growth an minimal sunlight. The lower end of this pine grove had a mowed lawn area (next door neighbors property who were also related to my friend family) You had to access the camping area through the neighbors propery as the overgrowth of briars and other weeds, brambles, trees made it impossible to get there directly for the E------- property. The pond in relation to the campsite was to the left if you were looking back up towards the road; with the stream running between. The dense pine grove then lay between you and the road; unless you skirted around it through the neigbors backyard.<BR><BR>This is what happened. No sighting but a vocalization.<BR><BR>We had gone down to the campsite had built a fire and been down there for about an hour. During this time we all felt uneasy even though we had been there before many times. This is a long time ago but to the best of my memory we had been joking; probably made something to eat over the fire but something felt really wrong this time. \"Wrong\" is the best word I can use to describe. I remember I felt like I couldn''t just sit down by the fire and stay with the conversation though. From back in the pine grove was the occasional, deliberate braking of branches that were just a little too large (to the sophisticated human ear) and just had the sound of being \"up off the ground some ways\" This would start and stop. We would listen and comment on it. First we thought maybe the mares had gotten back into the woods, unusual but this later was confirmed not to be so because we found out the next day that they were stabled for the night. We then thought it might be some older boys who were trying to scare us into running. It would be quiet for awhile then there would be a sense of movement closer to where we were and then receeding. We shined a flashlight and ventured back alittle ways but saw or smelled nothing. The sounds began again this time definately agitated, insistent with a very permiable feeling. We started to get un-nerved  moved out into the neighbors backyard. The sound grew louder, with traceable movement and then this ear splitting scream cut right out into the night. One loud shriek louder than anything should have to be. It just cut right to the core of your soul. Like so many reports I''ve read on this website, it''s virtually impossible to do it justice with a human description precisly because it sounded so inhuman. We just ran like hell back to the house, left everything behind. No sense of being followed at all. No visual sighting (I almost wish). No bad smells or odors. In terms of other reports this pales, I know. But this is what happened and I never forgot it. We knew what Sasquatch were at the time, but no one ever heard of sightings east of the Mississippi to the best of my memory then. We kind of joked that maybe that''s what our unseen friend was. Years later when I read and saw the reports from the southern part of York County (report on file with your website.) did I ever give any serious thought.",

    " Was out late one night walking my Beagle before retiring for the night.  We live in a somewhat rual area, the village of Orangeville has a population of about 600 or so.<BR><BR>Because of the town make up at that time, very few people were up at that hour.  so, in walking west up the road with the mountain to the north of us, all the hoses on the hill were dark and quiet with ony a dog or two barking.<BR><BR>I had walked my dog about 300 yards up the road, about 200 yards away from the closest house.  At this point the woods coming down from the mountain are right next to the road.<BR><BR>We had just stoped and were beginning our walk back to the house when my dog stoped and looked up  at the mountain.  His hair on his back stood up and he started growling.  I looked up to where he was staring and didn''t see any kind of movement or hear or smell anything different.<BR><BR>After about 10 seconds I tried to coax the dog into heading back to the house, but he did not move. About 30 seconds after the dog first stoped I heard a howel / scream of something that I have never heard before.  It seemed to come down off the mountain, it didn''t sound close by, so I figured the sound to come somewhere in front of us about 1/2 or near the top of the mountain.<BR><BR>The sound, similar sounding to the one at http://www.bluenorth.com/klamath_recording.htm made all my hairs stand on end, and my dog made a protective stance between me and the sound.  The sound lasted for about 20 seconds or less with the echo through the woods.  Several of the dogs on the hill also began barking when the sound came down off the moountain.<BR><BR>At the time I had no idea what I had heard, I coaxed my dog to move and we went back down to the house and turned in for the night.  Since that night I havn''t heard any other sounds like that.<BR><BR>The next morning when I took the dog up for his morning walk, I stoped in the area where we had heard the sound.  the dog acted normally and I looked for any kind of animal tracks but didn''t notice anything along the road edge or just inside the woods.<BR><BR>It wasn''t untill a few months later that when I was watching Sightnings and they played the recording of a possible Big Foot scream from Washington state that I realized I had heard the same sound in Pennsylvania just a few months previous.<BR><BR>At that time I really didn''t know of anyone to report it too, and also figured no one would beleive that I had heard such a sound.<BR><BR>It wasn''t untill a recient TV show on TLC about bigfoot that I dediced to do some more research and find a location to log my sighting.",

    " Our family was driving home from vacation last August when I saw something unusual in a cornfield. We were roughly 40-45 minutes north of Bethany Beach, Delaware traveling on Route 1 passing through farm country at the time.  We had rented a minivan and my husband was seated upfront driving with his Father next to him in the passenger''s seat. They were busy talking.  My daughter and mother-in-law were seated in the row of seats behind them.  My mother-in-law was reading a book to my daughter at the time.  I was seated in the very last row of seats in the minivan and sat on the passenger''s side of the car.  <BR><BR>As we were driving along and everyone else was busy either talking or reading, I was looking out the window at the passing countryside.  We were going through farm country at the time and as we drove past one corn field, something caught my eye.  The thing that initially got my attention was the fact that the corn stalks were now dried and yellow and it appeared that something dark brown was standing there in the middle of the corn stalks.  The roadway was slightly elevated above this particular field so I was essentially looking down onto the tops of cornstalks rather than them being level with the van.  <BR><BR>Having an interest in the subject of Bigfoot, I immediately went into observation mode and noted the following:  What I saw was medium to dark brown in color, it was taller than the cornstalks, it appeared to be about 3 feet wide and I may have been looking at a head and shoulders and it definitely wasn''t a piece of farm equipment, a scarecrow or a human.  In fact, I noted that there were no humans around on the farm at the time.  I was able to observe this for roughly 5-10 seconds as our minivan drove past this large field.  The brown \"thing\" was roughly 300 feet in off the road in the cornfield by itself.<BR><BR>I quickly tried to note the general location of where we were at the time.  I do not live in Delaware and was not familiar with the precise location.  However, not long after that, I spotted a sign for the Milton, Delaware exit off of Route 1.",

Prior to 1936, it was a large privately owned family estate (since the 18th century) and partially owned by the defense department in the early 20th century. The refuge area has largely been left untouched and never encroached by development, large scale farming, logging, or citizens. Farming was limited during the 18th century as the family line became very wealthy and used the massive area as a private estate for family members from the 19th century onward.Specific Location: Central Tract (extremely secured, gated and guarded area that is off limits to all citizens that are not employees)This area has been dedicated to bacterial, viral, pesticide, endangered species, natural resources, and migratory bird research for over 50 years. This tract is nationally famous from Rachel Carson''s \"Silent Spring\" book and the research which uncovered and revealed the extreme dangers of DDT and other pesticides. There are many old small research buildings trickled throughout the center portion of the tract. Surrounding the core of research buildings there are lots of very rare trees (true Chestnut trees, next to genetically modified Chestnut trees) and endangered plants. Beyond this core to the east are many mitigation research ponds and closed areas which breed endangered birds. The majority of the central tract is dense forests, streams, rivers and ponds.",

    "Yes, there are many incidents in this direct area. Most of the accounts are within a 5-10 mile radius. These accounts seemed to have started in the 1970''s when regional mass development began outside of DC and north towards Baltimore along the I-295/I-95 corridors.I will list some of the accounts which I am familiar with:1. During the 1990s a man driving home from work very early in the AM, spotted a dark bigfoot like creature hunched on the side of route 198 just off of I-95. As he drove past it stood up and ran off along the road jumping the guard rail.2. During the early 2000s, a lot of sightings of a large brownish black creature along the ******** River from I-95 downward into the ****. Government biologists from **** investigated and confirmed it was a black bear. However, many observers said it was bipedal and not on all fours. Many locals around the **** claimed whatever it was took \"refuge\" in the ****.3. Sightings during the building of Arundel Mills Mall in 1999, reported a large dark haired creature on the construction site. This report can be found on many sites and newspapers. This location is 10 miles north.4. On my first day on the job at the ****, I met with my direct manager, a senior staff member, and he said to me (his exact words), \"We do not discuss Bigfoot around here. Got it?\" (I realized instantly he was covering some thing up). He then said, \"We have a citizen in the area that from time to time sends us audio recordings and \"evidence\" that a Bigfoot lives on the ****. He often puts in for permits to come in and investigate. Never speak to him if you see him around the visitor areas.\"5. During my first driving tour through the refuge, a biologist from **** made the following statements to me. (We had reached the security gate which closes off River Road to everyone.) The biologist said to me, \"This is where the Bowie goatman lives you know? or a Bigfoot. That is if you believe in that stuff. And by the way welcome to your research area, have fun.\" I responded with, \"No matter, nothing in nature scares me.\" He then looked seriously at me and said, \"Until you get to see one.\"6. One day, several weeks after starting my work at the refuge, I was eating lunch in the office area that we share with **** police. One of the police said to me, \"Hows it going out in the hinterlands?\" I said, \"Fine. No one bothers me and its quiet out there.\" He then said something to the regards of, \"Seen anything creepy or odd yet? That is a strange area.\" I said, \"No\" (however I had already had strange experiences out there, but I did not want to mention anything in case he was testing me). He then mentioned briefly, \"I saw something like a huge dark bear walking on two legs one late night out on River Road, while doing a very rare drive through. I never went back through that place at night again. Only in the day light now.\" I just smirked and mildly laughed and said, \"Bowie goatman, eh?\" He said nothing after that.",

    "I have one major noteworthy aspect that I feel may be of importance. Before writing this report I did not of even think this was important, but now I do see a correlation.Earlier that same day, in the early morning (at dawn, this is when I started my work everyday), I began for the first time, data collecting on the island which the sounds came from.As I was collecting data on the edge of this very channel between the islands, the loose muddy bank gave way beneath my weight and I fell loudly into the water. I dropped my Geo XT GPS/CPU unit as I hit the water. (Luckily, it was waterproof) As I went under I finally could touch the bottom and push off. The water was about 7 ft deep. Before thinking, I dove back under to retrieve my GPS unit which was day glow yellow (thankfully). Then I struggled for about 2 or 3 minutes grabbing roots and anything to help me climb out.Once I got back up on solid land, I laid there for a minute catching my breath. I was covered head to toe with mud. I started laughing aloud and talking to myself, as I must admit, it was funny. I gathered all my equipment that had remained on dry land and carried everything down to the wide open rock covered beach on the large moving portion of the river.Being as there was no one else out there, I removed all my clothes and washed them off piece by piece in the river. I laid all my clothes out on large rocks to dry under the bright sunlight. I did keep my underwear on however, but nothing else. While my clothes were drying I sat on a large boulder and ate my lunch.I put my clothes back on later even though they were still damp. I remember later that day returning to the office and telling my story. Everyone kept commenting with humor that I smelled like the river and earth. At that time I figured silently to myself, \"what the hell I should just stay the night out there, being my scents were completely gone and I smelled as pure earth.\"So I returned back out there around 5pm after everyone left for the day and my evening story began.",

    " I was camping on the largest of the river islands on the ******** River in the extra restricted area of the ****''s Central Tract. It is an old growth forest. The understory was mostly clear of bushes and brush. I would from time to time camp out overnight there. I always camp with nothing more then a sleeping bag on the ground. While on the refuge I would not light fires, not cook food, not play music; just pure silence, meditation and observation.<BR><BR>Late on this one evening in late July, I heard wood knocking or clapping in the distance from the south portion of the river. I instantly thought of Bigfoot (I must be honest, especially after all the activity I had observed throughout the months prior). I had a large stick with me, so I slapped it against an old tree. At first I heard no reply. I repeated the banging once every few minutes until I did got a response of knocking back. This was in the same location as before. It then returned to silence until about 15 minutes later when another knocking occurred.<BR><BR>About an hour after the wood knocking I heard definite bi-pedal footsteps walking very slowly. The footsteps were obviously coming from something which was being very cautious. The creature was approaching from the south where the wood knocking sounds were coming from. I assumed that it was on the next island downstream (which is separated by a narrow deep channel of water 15 ft across by 6-10 ft deep). I remained silent the whole time as to not scare it off. The next thing I heard was a loud \"kerplunk\" of something falling or dropping into the water channel.<BR><BR>Around 15 minutes later I heard a few faint footsteps walking away back to the south (these steps were not as gentle or cautious as before). It sounded as if it were tired of the game or just leaving because it investigated what I was doing. The rest of the night was silent.<BR><BR>Following morning:<BR><BR>The next morning I went over to the next island at the break of dawn. I found no obvious footprints or evidence. However, I did find possible large prints but they were not overly revealing.<BR>",

    "This individual occurrence was on a riverine island on the **** River located in the center of the restricted, non-access preservation area. The island is completely old growth forest which is mostly brush free and wide open under the dense canopies. The old trees (sycamore, white oak, ash, tulip poplar, red oak) are all 40-90 inch DBH (diameter at breast height) with the lowest branches being ~30 ft. or more off the ground. The age range is 150-500 years old.The canopy is so full that it restricts sunlight to the forest floor. Even during the brightest day on the island it feels like dawn or dust. The ground is full of rich black soil and a nice bed of fallen leaves. Scattered throughout the floor are various forms of edible and poisonous mushrooms. Where holes in the canopy allow sunlight in, there is patches of low bush berry, green briar, and other shrub like vegetation.The entire fringe of the island where sunlight reaches all day is full of smaller trees (pawpaw, young ash, oak, birch, maple, sycamore, cherry, holly) and under which is dense shrubs (ivy, lespidesa, barberry, green briar). Beyond the islands edge to the east side is a ~10-15 ft. wide weathered rock covered beach on the river side. On the opposite side to the west is a muddy steep bank which drops into a deep channeled branch of the river (10-15ft deep).This island very commonly has deer and wild turkey passing through and nesting down.Also an abundance of box turtles lives on this island. The river side were muddy is packed with fresh water clams.",

    " My friend and I had been searching for a place called Dickerson quarry in Dickerson Md, and had just located it on a map. We had to park on some railroad tracks by the aquaduct and walk through some very dense sticker bushes and overgrowth to find the place. To describe the quarry, it is located in the middle of the woods. It is about 75 yards long and about 30 yards wide with very tall cliffs, about 50 to 80 feet tall in some places. However there are a few places where you can walk down to the waters edge. As we were approaching the quarry, we heard this very loud screeching sound coming from about 25 yards away in the overgrowth. It was very loud and it actually startled us when it first started. The only way to describe the sound would be to say it sounded like a pig getting slaughtered. We stopped walking and waited but it stopped, whatever it was. We continued walking and found the quarry, hearing the strange sound several more times, always coming from a different place. We made a survey and located a place to go down to the waters edge to sit and rest. As we made our way around the quarry we heard the screaming again. Actually coming from the area where we wanted to go! We were not too alarmed though, being curious and stupid. We made it to the waters edge and sat down and started to look around and check the place out. I had picked up a stick off the ground and got out my pocket knife and started to carve on the wood. Suddenly there was a very large splash in the water. It sounded like a person had just jumped in but when I looked up could see ripples in the water where something had gone in. Figuring it was a rock falling from the cliffs we began talking again. About 5 minutes elapsed and we heard another splash. This one bigger and it was very far away from the edge. I asked my freind \"Did you throw something in?\". He said no, he was looking at me. We looked around to see if anyone was there that we didnt see but there was no one anywhere. We sat for about 5 more minutes talking and then heard another big splash. Neither of us saw what made it but the disturbance in the water was so big we guessed it had to be something big! We started to think that someone was in the woods and didnt want us trespassing and was trying to scare us off. However as we started to really think, we became aware there was no way anyone could throw any rock that big, that far. So we made the choice to go ahead and leave. As we were climbing up and out of the quarry another splash came from very near where we had been sitting and also sounded very big. We reached the top and started to make our way to the car. We only walked about 20 feet when something came crashing through the tree branches and hit the ground near us very hard. It sounded like a 20 pound rock hitting the ground. At that point we both stopped walking and turned and really looked hard into the woods. Neither of us saw anything. As we stood there listening, I swear Ive never heard the woods more quite in my life.  We started to walk again and the objects being thrown at us started to get alot more accurate. I remember saying to my freind \"What the hell is going on?\" His response was to tell me GO!!! We took off running and reached our only real obsticle, a creek about 10 feet wide where we had to cross on a log. I went first and he was close behind. As we where halfway across the log something landed in the creek about 5 feet from me that had to be the size of a paint bucket. <BR>I didnt see if it was a rock or what but it was big. At that point I jumped for it and hit the ground running with my freind right on my tail, neither of us looking back. I have never really felt scared like that, but that day I had the thought that we might meet something that was beyond nature and not live to tell about it. <BR> Our journey into the woods took about 30 minutes due to the high growth of pricker bushes, Our journey out took about 3 minutes! We reached the car and the only after the adrenaline wore off <BR>did we realize we both were bleeding nicely from running top speed through summer overgrowth. <BR>At the time, I didnt know about the connection between the rocks being thrown at us and the screaming to bigfoot, but it sounds like a classic case. Ive only been back a few times since then and only in the winter where I can see for 100 yards!!",

There were also prints found in other areas of the state park and near Bel Air road. There was even a story I heard about a whole family on Whitt Rd. (right down the street) that had seen an 8 ft. tall creature on their back porch one night watching them eat dinner. When they started screaming, it took off. Also, all my friends and myself have grown up in the woods, and for years weve found mutilated remains of deer strewn everywhere (possibly by cougar) but I have doubts a cougar could do this sort of thing. I''ve also heard stories from a man thats lived in the neighborhood his whole entire life, and when he was younger his friends and him seen what they believed to be a sasquatch numerous times around the power lines, but it''s been a long time since I''ve heard the stories, so I don''t remember the exact details, but I can still get in touch with the man.",

It lies near the road, Piney Orchard Parkway, and railroad tracks but they are still used. Approximatley 2-3 a.m. we heard groaning and splashing in the water nearby. this was later confirmed later that morning though. When I heard the noise I thought it was one of my friends. So I peaked my head out to see but it was too dark so I yelled to \"shutup\" and the being ran away. Once again I thought it was my friends just playin around so I wasn''t concerned and I didn''t investigate.<BR> When the sun rose we started packing up and notice huge footprints in the sand that led into the trees coming from the water. The stides were enormous, we could fit one of my shorter friends who is 5''4\" between the prints easily. The size of the foot was very large about a size 19 or 20.

    " I came across your website, and decided to look for reports in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. After reading the posted reports, I thought I''d share the following:<BR><BR>I resided in the Annapolis area for approximately 8 years, from 1969-1977, and lived in numerous areas in and around the city.<BR><BR>In 1972-73, I was living in the Saferan (sp?) area, outside of Epping Forest, on the outskirts of Annapolis. This area was a wooded peninsula extending into the Severn River. <BR><BR>During the summer of ''72 or ''73, I was 10-11 years old. One evening I awoke because of the summer heat. My bed lay roughly 2 feet from and parallel to the bedroom window. The bedroom window was on the ground floor level and faced a roadway lit by a single street light in this area. I recall having just awoke and sat upright in bed, looking to my left at the floor fan. I recall thinking that the evening was very, very hot. As I sat in my bed waking up, I turned to my right, looking directly into the window. What I saw can only be described as a large head, with distinct hair covering it; it was much, much larger than any human head. I recall seeing the thing''s eyes blinking at me, from a distance of 2-4 feet. I also recall seeing the teeth in it''s mouth. The eyes and the teeth contrasted sharply from the darkness of the rest of the head. The light from the roadway was behind and to the thing''s left, so I wasn''t able to make out any distinct features, other than the eyes and the teeth. There were no sounds other than the fan. This thing was making no threatening moves, in fact it was doing nothing other than looking into my bedroom window and seeing me looking at it. After maybe 10-15 seconds, during which time I went from trying to comprehend what I was seeing to being very, very frightened, I lay back down on my bed, rolled off the bed to my left and crawled out of my bedroom on my hands and knees to a bathroom. My mother found me sometime in the bathroom. When I relayed the story to her, she told me the curtains were closed and to go back to bed. I know the curtains weren''t closed, but, thanks mom.<BR><BR>For what it''s worth.",

    " It was in at the end of August 2003. My self and a friend were fishing the Potomac River. We Were fishing between mile marker 57 and 58 off the C&O Canel. We parked in the town of Knoxville Maryland and crossed the rail road tracks to get to the river. We were fishing in a brach of the Potomac that was about 600 meters long before it went back into the river. We got to the spot around 8:00 AM we had our backs to the Potomac when fishing the banks of the branch. Behind us was the Potomac. There was an island that was about 600 meters long and about 200 meters at it widest point. The island is a hill and you can''t see the Potomac from were we were fishing. We were only there about Five mintues when heard what sounded like a dying deer. My friend heard it too, I said it sounds like some one shot a deer and it was dying. This whole time we were walking down the river and fishing at the same time. As I got farther down the branch of the river my friend said what is that alful smell. I said it must be that deer. <BR><BR>My friend said that is the worst smell I have ever smelt before. Then we heard some thing moving behind us on the island. I was thinking that deer is not dead yet. I started to walk across the water (which was about three feet deep) to the other side to see it. As I was walking I could smell it and it was getting worst. My friend said what is it, I don;t know I can''t see any thing but I can smell it. He started walking over towards me. He was walking with the river (south east) I was standing in front of a hill and could not see over it. Wear he was walking from he could see over the hill. I was about 50 meters down river from him. He said John I see some thing, I said is it a deer. No I think it is a bear. I started to walk back and towards him. I was hoping it was not going to atttack us. I said lets go some place else. <BR><BR>I wanted to fish not get attacked by a bear. He was walking to me and I was walking towards him I said lets go. Then were heard it again and I said that dose not sound like a bear.He said No but it might be a bigfoot. I said all the more reasons to go some place else. As I got to the bank acrossed from the island I got up on land to see if I could see it. He was still in the water but walking towards the bank wear I was standing. I could not see any thing but I did hear some thing walking on the other side of the hill. I said maybe it was a hunter and he killed a deer and now he is coming over the hill back to his car draging the deer. The steps were getting louader and I could smell the smell with every breath. At this point I am ready to run. I was a 4:18 miler in college and I was hoping my feet don''t fail me now. <BR><BR>It stopped and we could not hear it any more. I would have ran like hell if I would have seen a bigfoot. That might have been the day I went sub 4:00 in the mile. We left and talked about all day long. We still talking about it. He likes to tell the story I don''t go up that way much.",

    " This was at Davison US Army Airfield, Ft Belvoir Virginia. This was a while back so please hang in there with me.<BR><BR>From late 1977 to Dec 1979 I was assigned to Davison as a Military Policeman. The airfield is not that large and I am pretty sure it''s still an active military installation even now. The airfield is pretty much surrounded by a wooded area and part of the airfield is on a small swamp. When I started working there I was chided by other MP''s to be careful of the so called \"DUSAA Swamp Monster\" it was called. <BR><BR>We had to have a walking 2 man patrol a couple times a night walk the perimeter fence inside the field area. There were countless times while on those walking patrols that I occasionally made, where sounds were heard not only from the swamp area but also the wooded area along the south perimeter fence. By sounds I mean you could hear branches breaking, not small branches mind you, but I mean a VERY LOUD audible CRACK, you''d hear dogs barking in the distance and occasionally some kind of animal - which after hearing recordings on the net of a Squatch - they sounded AWFUL familiar! <BR><BR>Randomly I also had to pull guard at the main gate which is right there on Route 1 - the main entrance to the airfield. I''ve had the crap scared out of me more than I like to think about at that gate at night - you''re there all by yourself in a small wooden gate shack with 1 street light right above you and that''s it. Anyway, to the south in the woods I''ve heard bangs (what you all call knocks) and animal noises, I''ve seen deer running like all hell and jump the fence on to the air field in the middle of the night getting away from something and only 1 time, and it was 1 time way too many, when I saw a deer following the fence at about 2 AM one night and I heard something in the woods, I yelled out and I saw the red reflection of 2 eyes staring at me back from the blackness just inside the trees just out of range of the street light - I still see those eyes when I think about it and it''s been what... 34 years!!!  <BR><BR>One night, about 10pm, or there about, I had a civilian motorist come to the gate off highway 1 and ask me to call the State Police, I asked why and he said this big BIG hairy thing... yup he said thing ... walked across the road in front of him and headed onto Ft Belvoir property and he almost hit it. He thought at first it was a man in a gorilla suit but it was way too tall to be a man. This guy was shaking like hell too. I told him that it''s probably gone by now and the [troopers] probably would not find it. I had heard of other reports by motorists and even the State Police about sightings along Route 1 between DUSAA and Ft Belvoir.  This happened year round, almost any month of the year.",

    " I''m an experienced outdoorsman, for what has been most all of my life. I was always 100% confident while in the woods, even at night. <BR><BR>It was mid August of 1985, myself and a good friend went camping in the George Washington National Forest. One of the most heavily forested areas around. At the time you would be hard pressed to find more desolation in Virginia than what we had. We drove up a fire road well past the few houses in the hollow. We made camp in a fire break between the mountains, but close to the bottom of the west ridge. I knew this little spot from previous adventures in that area.<BR><BR>After making camp, we went back down in the valley for some fishing, shooting, and some time in town. We got back to camp around 9:30pm. It was pitch black out, no moon that night. We couldn''t see a thing without the car headlights on. We finished unloading the car, and got a fire going. We sat around the fire for an hour or so. We had dinner, just some canned goods. We started talking, having a couple of beers, and enjoying the wilderness. Close to 11:00pm I personally noticed the woods were strangely quiet when all sorts of creatures should be making their presence known by now. <BR><BR>During a break in our conversation I heard the first of many howls. I looked at my friend and gestured to be quiet and listen. Then he heard it too. He asked \"What the hell is that?\". I shrugged and whispered \"I don''t know. I''ve been romping around these woods my whole life and never that before\". We zeroed in on the location of the howls, and they were coming from the west ridge. I estimate they were between 300 and 500 yards away. As I sat silent listening we began hearing crashing through the woods above us along with heavy footsteps. At some point I looked at my friend, who was a city boy and said \"That''s no bear, no human, and it sure as hell aint no siren.\". I could tell it was big, and I mean BIG! It was most deep, long, and carrying howl anyone could imagine. No man, animal, or machine could ever emulate this!<BR><BR>After 30 - 40 minutes of listening to this god awful howling. We decided to investigate. My friend was a well trained active duty Marine and I''ve never seen him unnerved, but he''s looking to me for answers I just don''t have. We both armed ourselves. We didn''t use the flashlights, because giving away your location is the first mistake. My friend had the 12 gauge, and I had a high powered rifle. In any other circumstance we would have had zero fear because we had brought a lot of firepower with us. But we were both visibly scared.<BR><BR>As we moved from camp and onto the road the fire light faded and we were in complete darkness. We kept close as we walked north. We separated a little and get some space between us so we hear more clearly. I was about 20 feet ahead of him. Even though our eyes had adjusted, we still couldn''t see any part of each other. I couldn''t see him from 5 feet, so we used sound to reference our locations. By now we realized this thing was pacing us to our west side way up the hill. The howling would pause at moments, and we could still hear crashing through the brush, and the occasional howl. I suspect we went up the road about 150 yards or more.<BR><BR>I whispered something like- I think we''ve gone far enough. It''s pacing us, and getting closer. He said something to the effect of- No kidding it is! We concluded camp was the safest place to be for the night. We made our way back side by side this time, and making no attempt to conceal our location, because it no longer mattered. it knew our exact location. I could tell it was no more than 200 yards away at this point, and closing in. The sounds of footsteps and breaking branches were more clear, distinct, and closer by the minute. It wasn''t paralleling us anymore, it was coming down at us in a slow zig zagging manner. I think we both knew the guns were pointless this moment, it was so dark we only would''ve shot each other by accident. <BR><BR>When we got back to camp we clutched the guns tight as we sat by the fire and listened. We kept pouring more and more wood on the fire as a deterrent and source of light. The little flashlights we had were never meant for the situation we had on hand. As we sat the howling went on and on. Sporadic at times, but never-ending. I started thinking to myself this has to be a protest to our presence. Anyway, we decided to wrap it up and go to sleep. As we lay in our sleeping bags in the tent we could hear this thing go on and on, howling and walking through the forest until we finally fell asleep sometime after midnight, or maybe even 1:00am. I knew full well it was no bear! Bears don''t howl, and could easily walk up right up on you in total silence.<BR><BR>Fast forward to roughly 1996/7. I''m sitting on the sofa with my wife, and we''re watching TV. Some show comes on about mysteries, unexplained etc. They play the Ohio Bigfoot howling. I shot out of my seat, pointed at the TV and looked her in the eye and said \"That''s it! That''s EXACTLY what I heard that night!''. She said something like- Baby, \"you''re white as a ghost!\" Sit down. I remember the white as a ghost part very well. <BR><BR>I wouldn''t go back into the woods by myself again for over 10 years, and only in daylight. Still, it would be over 20 years before I could sleep in the woodlands again. I had to do it. I was the father of a Cub Scout, and couldn''t let down my son. Aside from that I''ll never sleep in the woods again. I was 18 at the time, today I''m 52, and I know I was being stalked. ",

    "Yes. In the past few months two of my neighbors, one just up the road saw one cross the street just up from his house early one morning. This is what prompted me to say something in the first place because he is thought of as a reliable person who can be believed. He does not want to be contacted. A man who lives down the road around the corner reported a sighting to J B''s deli about a few weeks later. he had no idea about the other reports. OTHER STORIES from Report # 12910: There is a load of them from this area across the Smith River down by Hiouchi and Gasquet. A forestry employee saw a Bigfoot on HWY 96 up river in full daylight right around the time mine started showing up, a man down my road saw one early one morning cross my road, a forestry employee saw one at the mouth of Elk creek and the Klamath River, which is close to me...I live on I Creek just up river from there. A few of my neighbors say they have smelled them but not seen them. There is so much more and this thing is continuing.OTHER STORIES from Report # 20720: Yes, but I am not at liberty to discuss them because the woman who saw it was a Forestry employee. There are however many stories I have been told by the locals since then describing many fascinating things about who they call \"bushmen\", and \"oma\".",

    "I hate to have to bring this up but I am going to mention it. I am brand new to this Bigfoot research stuff, and I am unaware for the most part about competition or conflicting opinions of researchers. I want everyone who is serious about Bigfoot to know about it because I think there really may be something here resembling and acting like a sasquatch. If this is true then my motivation is driven by my desire for everyone to know about it and to have a chance in being involved in something new? Have you been able to have a potential oppurtunity to study one in this way here? If it does come here seasonally than would this be the first time this oppurtunity has ever presented itself?",

    " My name is [TH], and I have lived in an old Mining Camp, in Northern California for the past two years. During that first fall I would hear a strange whistling call that would come from a Sequoia tree that stands out in about 2 acres of blackberries that surrounds my yard. The berries run down to a thermal spring on the property that itself runs down to I creek, which is around 50 ft. further up the hill from that creek.<BR><BR>I thought this was a stray bird of maybe a tropical sort perhaps lost by someone. It would call to me in a guttural clicking sound followed by a series of sing song chirping whistles. I would call back, and then it to me and so on and so forth for around 20 minutes to 45 minutes before it would stop. It was always at dusk towards night and so I would call it a \"night bird\".<BR><BR>There have also been numerous times that I smell a strong wet garbage smell that shows up suddenly in my yard and house. The latest incident is taking place around every few days now, at least for the last three and one half months. This smell shows up in the late spring and usually stays around off and on through the last apples falling from the fruit trees on my property. I rent.<BR><BR>I have sensed something looking at me from the steep hill across the road from my house that comprises my back yard. Sort of like the feeling one gets when a puma is near. <BR><BR>The other night I had an incident where the creature I am talking about banged on my trailer at around four in the morning. When I went outside on the porch to see if it was somebody, I had every single hair on my body go up instantly. I just knew that whatever it was; was right there. I beat feet into the house and locked the door. The early morning smell was so strong that I couldn''t even sleep. It smelled like a garbage dump. I have been around lions and have had the hairs on the back of my neck go up, but never anything remotely like this.<BR><BR>I have heard very heavy thumps coming down the hill behind my house late at night many times during these same seasons. They sound like very heavy footfall. There is one particularly loud thump that I can hear that I think I have identified as this thing as it jumps from the road next to my house down into the my yard on its way to the creek.<BR><BR>I have seen it twice now. The first time was around four in the morning when I walked out of my trailer onto my front porch. The door squeals so it makes a lot of noise and when I opened it I must have startled the thing.<BR><BR>At first I thought I had just seen the biggest bear of my life until it registered in my head that it was running on two long legs, crouched over. I noticed that it was swinging two very long arms. It was the fastest moving animal I have ever seen. [In 2005] I reported it to a place here called J.Bs deli and was put in touch with [Carmine (Tom) Biscardi -- a.k.a. \"the Great American Bigfoot Research Team\"]. They came and investigated and now I have a live video feed coming from two spots near the creek.<BR><BR>The second time I saw it was at around one- thirty in the morning a few weeks later. I noticed the apple tree in the far corner of my yard going berserk. The big branches were really shaking hard. I had a night vision scope so I took it outside and looked through it but the tree settled down and I did not see anything so I sat the scope down. When I looked back over there I saw a human form from mid upper arm up walking towards the creek at the edge of the berry bushes. The bushes are around six plus feet tall, and this thing was perhaps two feet taller. I saw large rounded head on very large rounded, thick shoulders. It seemed to have very little neck. I could see that it was hairy and got quite a good view because it was silhouetted by a light on my neighbors porch.<BR><BR>My daughter was staying in a tent out in the yard a few nights later and was awakened by some whistling and then by something hitting her tent. Like something had been thrown.<BR><BR>There has been a print found on my property also. It is around 19 inches long and about 8 inches wide. I have never seen anything like it, but it looks like a giant human footprint to me.<BR><BR>These incidences are ongoing. I think this thing summers here. What do you think? Also, do you have any suggestions on your experience as to how I may be able to study it or observe it here?<BR>I would be delighted at any input. <BR><BR>Excerpts from Report # 12910                                           October 27, 2005<BR>OBSERVED: I have new possible evidence on the hill behind my house that I and a few friends of mine have found, and we desperately want someone more qualified to look at what we have here. I would appreciate talking to someone ASAP so that I can connect with you for a possible story.<BR><BR>For two years I have heard a whistle and chuffing sounds coming from the berries bushes in my yard. I thought it was some lost big tropical bird. I would call back to it, and it would call back, and so forth. I have had some bad odor incidences including one that woke me up from a dead sleep and gagged me.<BR><BR>A volunteer found a footprint up the hill behind my house and some friends of mine, [T. C.] and [N. M.] found additional footprints and hand prints in an area up the hill from my house that appears to be some form of crude camp. I have been there three times now and the second time I went there I observed that some 4-5 inches around 4-5 ft. long branches have been brought from some where other than that location and laid in a sort of rectangle fashion around a depression in the earth. There are more of these depressions without branch borders in the area. <BR><BR>There are snapped trees at @ the 10 ft. level; there are \"huts\", for a lack of a better term made from big branches. Some look older and some look recently made. There are also snapped trees and tracks that seem to form a path from this site down the hill towards my house. [N. M.] Found two pretty fresh handprints that appear to be coming out from one of the \"huts\". The finger tips are spread much farther a part than a human could have done. We found three separate footprints there that did not seem to be very old, maybe a couple of weeks, but no more.<BR><BR>I saw the Bigfoot three times now, once at 4 AM in the morning, and twice at 1 AM in the morning. It was very dark each time except once it walked in front of a light and I got a good look at its height and silhouette.<BR><BR>Excerpters from Report # 20720:                                        August 09, 2007 <BR>It was four thirty in the morning as I opened the sliding glass door to my trailer looking east towards my yard and I Creek; I thought to myself, that''s the biggest bear that I have ever seen. As it stood up from the blackberries in my yard it was eating, I saw two long arms and two very long legs. It began to run north towards the path I have that goes thru the berries to the creek, and I said to myself'' \"that''s not a bear\". I knew I had just seen a Bigfoot. WOW!!!<BR><BR>I saw it run towards the creek and I heard it crashing through the bushes down there. I did not follow. I''m not usually a scared kind of person, but I did not follow because I was scared. I had never seen anything like that in my life. I live in the woods and I have seen lots of bears and large animals. I  consider myself good at estimating, so I estimated it as 10 to 12 ft. tall and it probably weighed somewhere in the neighborhood of 1200 lbs. no lie.<BR><BR>Later that day I went down and looked on the trail the way it had gone. I found horse hair ferns that had been torn out from an area of about a thirty foot radius where something had torn them out and made a large \"bed\", for lack of a better word, there on the ground near a natural spring that comes out from under a maple tree. I walked down to the creek and found the tops of two very large footprints in the sand at the very edge of the creek. The prints disintegrated into the water as I watched them, but I was pretty freaked out by then.  <BR>          <BR>On with the story...<BR>Every night for a whole summer I would smell it in my yard, it smelled like a mixture of wet dog, garbage and sewer...if you can imagine that.<BR><BR>One night the smell woke me up gagging. I thought it was a bag of garbage I had left out on the porch that night. You see, it is so much easier to stay in a sort of denial when you see these things. It really is too hard to believe what you are encountering. Anyway, the cameras were up in my yard at that point and I had these computers in my house so I sat down at the computer and started looking at my emails. <BR><BR>There is a window right next to my sliding glass door where my porch and stairs are. I heard a small sound behind me at that window while my back was turned away at the monitor and when I looked I saw a huge dark face in that window. The face was tilted slightly and I could make out the shiny spots at the brow and bridge of the nose. It was very dark outside and what I saw was the reflection of the things face in the light from the dining room. I looked at it and it looked back at me for a few seconds and then it turned away. A few seconds later I heard a loud bang as it slammed something into the end of the trailer. I looked later and found a big dent.<BR><BR>I got up and ran out onto the porch. I actually thought it was pranksters. I got out on the porch and noticed how dark it was in the yard at that point. I yelled, \"Get out of here!\" I thought that would scare away any kids that might be in my yard when suddenly every hair in my body stood on end. Have you ever been around a lion when the hairs on the back of you neck stand up, Yeah kind of like that, but about 50 times stronger?  I suddenly thought...man, this thing is right here in the yard with me. I promptly panicked...ran inside...and locked my door.<BR><BR>A few nights later I saw it walk across my property. There is a field light across my property in my neighbors yard and I saw it backlit as it walked down to the creek. I saw a tall figure...@12 ft. tall with large mounded shoulders and a sort of conical shaped head. I saw very long arms swinging as it walked. I could only see the top portion of this guy because it was walking by 8 ft. tall blackberry bushes.<BR><BR>I went up on the hill behind my house with a friend and we found a footprint up there. It freaked me out too because I wasnt expecting to find anything to tell you the truth. We made a cast and I would very much like to have that cast. I heard it is in litigation.<BR><BR>I have been up the hill above my house since then and I have found places with big holes in the ground where \"beds\" have been made. Some of them have crude frames in them made from 12 inch diameter snapped off branches that are crisscrossed to form frames. I thought that was strange. In those places there are numerous foot and handprints.<BR>",

    "There are two water features on this property that may be of interest. A large crerk,\"I\" Creek, and a thermal spring that creates a nice pool where it emerges from the base of a maple tree in my yard. The spring winds down through the blackberries about 50 feet where it falls into the creek. Note that there are many trees and willows in the yard that through years of weight from blackberry vines have bent over and now form many \"rooms under the foliage. Some of these are quite large.ENVIRONMENT from Report # 12910: I have around one and a half acres with a spring and a creek. The wilderness to the coast at Crescent City starts across the street from my house. There are lots of blackberries and fruit trees on my property. There are bent willows trees covered in blackberries that make nice places for big animals to hide... (I.e. bears, cougars, and Bigfoots).",

Thinking it was his friend he called to him and his friend stepped out of the bushes infront of him with a frightened look on his face saying it wasn''t him.

    " After finally getting my twelve campers to sleep I left them with my co-counselor and took the short walk to the showers.  The time was 11:00 pm and everyone was asleep or at least in their cabins.  It took me 3 minutes to walk to the showers and on the way I didn''t notice anything unusual.  After my shower I stepped outside at approximately 11:25 to walk around to the other side of the building.  At this point I recall the sounds of the forest being stilled or a little subdued.  I also noticed that there were no sounds of the junior staff coming from the bunk house or pool as was usual that time of night, but it didn''t make much of an impression on me as I entered the other side of the building and grabbed my laundry basket.<BR><BR>  Coming back outside and rounding the building I heard something that stopped me in my tracks.  It seemed to be coming from a wooded area west of the bunk house and my initial thought was that it was junior staff playing around, laughing, and yelling.  But the sound seemed to be coming from one individual and was carrying very far.  It was a really loud howling changing into a type of whining bark and then ending almost like a hoot.  It was a sound that puzzled me because I am knowledgable in the sounds of wildlife and had never heard anything like it.  I also knew somehow that it was impossible for a human to make that sound, yet it sounded eerily human.  <BR><BR>Since I only heard it once I sucked it up and started walking out of the circle of light streaming from the shower building and towards the girl''s cabins.  Of course my cabin was the last one on the end and of course most people had forgot to turn on their porch lights.  None of this bothered me though until I heard the noise again.  It was a little closer and louder and it frightened me that it wasn''t just a one time thing as it immediately \"called\" again after the second time.  I wasn''t afraid I was going to get attacked or anything but it would be nice to be indoors so I started walking faster.<BR><BR>  The sound was repeating itself again and it sounded as if whatever was making it was getting still closer and paralleling my path.  I finally decided to break into a run and quickly reached my cabin, entering it.  The time that had elapsed from when I first heard the \"call\" til when I entered my cabin was probably a minute and a half since I ran some of the way back to my cabin.  I also didn''t hear anything else after I got inside but that may be due to the fact that I put on my discman to calm my nerves.  Also, the number of \"calls\" I heard in the elapsed time were about seven, some flowing into each other near the end.<BR><BR>  The next day I told the camp director and a few other counselors what had happened but they brushed it off as being a turkey or a dog and even though I didn''t know what it was, I knew it wasn''t one of these two.  Being a prankster and practical hoaxster wasn''t on my side because many thought I was joking.  When I wouldn''t relent with my story I was poked fun at and so I think anyone else that may have heard anything may have been discouraged from saying anything.<BR><BR>  I didn''t make this report sooner because I didn''t discover the website until a few months ago and I have been searching the internet for sound clips of wild animals to maybe rule out or make a possible connection with what I heard.  Everything I listened to was worlds away from what I heard, except for sound clips of supposed Sasquatch that were available on this site and some others.     ",
    :environment
    "The sound was coming from the forest to the north of the Ranch, the area we would take the campers to hike, where there was nothing man made for about a few miles North and West of the Ranch area. In the immediate area I recall there being an old trail and delapidated bridge over a canal some say was constructed under the direction of George Washington. The area was thickly wooded and to the East a 1/4 of a mile was the Ranch bunk house, ropes course, and stables. South about a 1/4 of a mile of the area were the boy''s cabins, the lodge, the nurses cabin, and the girl''s cabins.",

What I saw was the SAME animal you showed in the Dec 31, show [NY State]. It made the hair on my neck rise, and a chill go down my back, I still feel that fear even today.

I am constantly in the woods and have seen and heard every animal that is in these parts of the woods, and I''ve never heard anything like that before.

    " It was late July 2007 and my wife and I had brought our newborn baby daughter home just a few days earlier. It was about 1 AM and I was in the living room of my house watching television after pulling 2nd shift at work. My wife and baby daughter were two rooms away sleeping. She had opened the bedroom window earlier to let a little cool air in. All of a sudden a scream came from that corner of the house that stood me right up off the couch. I ran to the bedroom to find my wife sitting up in the bed as wide eyed and shocked as me. When I finally gathered myself enough and went outside to investigate, I found nothing. We kind of forgot about it until watching Finding Bigfoot several years later. They played what they thought were howls of the creature recorded on tape.

    " At around 11pm on July 26th my wife and I we''re night fishing on the backwater of cranesnest river in Dickinson county Virginia. My wife''s head was hurting so she decided to take a nap we had heard something large walking in the woods but wrote it off as a bear or deer as both are plentiful in our area. She had been asleep for about an hour when I heard a large knock about 50 yards up in the tree line then about 15 to 20 seconds later several hundred yards up the ridge there was another knock. Both sounded as if someone had taken a 4x4 post and struck a tree with it. Then about 10 min later there was a splash in the water about 20 feet away from our boat. This splash sounded like something weighing 20 or 30 lbs had struck the water waking my wife. It''s not unusual to hear large fish jumping at night but this was different after the splash no more than a couple minutes had passed and there was 2 more knocks. And they were closer than the first one. <BR><BR>We pulled anchor reeled in our lines and as we were leaving we heard 2 more knocks. My wife said she heard the knocks up on the ridge but I didn''t hear those, just the sound of a large animal walking up the river same way we were traveling as if it was following us. When it came to a shallow cove where it would have had to swim we stopped hearing the walking sounds.<BR><BR>This is the second time we encountered this animal we had an experience about a month and a half earlier we heard a big animal walking around and had big splashes in the water as if it were throwing things at us on that night as well.<BR>",

This area is frequented by large amounts of hunters during the fall which should have made the deer stay very far away. We also had a large campfire.

    " I live in Tazewell VA. Last Friday on June 20, 2014 me and my son was cutting hay on my dad''s farm in Thompson Valley near Route 16. It was close to 3pm and the sun was mostly out. I was cutting hay way ahead of my son, the field is half surrounded by woods and near the Clinch Mountains. I had made a pass by the corner of the field on a hill side and my mowing cutter is heavy so it slid down the hill while cutting, and left a strip of grass about 60 foot long before I seen it. So I raised the cutter and turned my head to back up and re-cut and out of the corner of my eye something caught my attention. I turned my head a little more and I saw something real dark or black and tall and slim with long legs running on an angle away and down the hill real fast . Now the beast was not on our side of the property and the slim patch of woods where I seen it was only about 4 ft. wide. The sun was bright so I saw it for the 3 to 5 seconds real fine! Below where it ran and beside one the upper ends of the property are thicker woods! At first it did not dawn on me what I just had seen because we were trying to get the hay cut before it got too late. But as I was going on and thought about why was a man there and ran off when I stopped the tractor to back up! Then it dawned on me it was to tall and it was blackish in color, and the 3 steps I plainly saw it make was the distance between 3 fence post. We put our fence post around 10 feet apart so that would make it about 25 to 30 feet in length in 3 STEPS! I then knew what I saw was human shape but too big for a human and if it was someone I would have saw colors for the pant and shirt, there was no colors just dark. I forgot to mention the bigfoot I saw was around 100 yards away so the first time I passed it not seeing it, and when I stopped to back up with the tractor It must have thought I saw it and that''s when it ran off I guess? I stopped to tell my 17 year-old son what I saw, he is 6ft 2 and slender. He crossed the fence where I saw it and stood there till I walked to the place I had seen it and I knew it was much taller than him! We found no hair or foot prints just cow and horse. And one horse hair. I am a christian man.  would not lie and tell this occurrence of my life if it was not so. That image is burnt in my mind till the day I die! I would have to say it was around 7 foot tall! And fast!",

The animal then proceeded to moan again, however this time, I also heard a growl. After the second moan, I then heard what I can only describe as a series of moaning howls. <BR><BR>The howls sent a cold chill up my spine.

    " It was the summer of 1983 or 84 and I was working for a company during the summer months trying to pay my way through college.  I worked 58 hours a week so I had little time to do anything else besides work.  I had purchased a tent and decided to go camping one Saturday night (it was in August as best I can remember).  Because of the hours I worked, this was the only night I could go camping (I also went to church on Sundays but I had plenty of time to get up and make it to church  service did not start until 10:00 AM).<BR><BR>After arriving home from work on the Saturday (date not known exactly) I planned to go camping on, I packed my backpack with all the necessary items for the short stay including my new tent.  I left the house and hiked the mile or so to the area where I planned to camp.  Also, my dog accompanied me.  He was a fairly large collie dog weighing about 80 pounds.  This dog was very intelligent and to my knowledge was not afraid of any animal (this is an important fact to this incident).  I had never seen him back down from a fight.    <BR><BR>The area was forest (a mix of pine and eastern hardwoods) and consisted of 1,050 acres.  I knew this area well because I had hunted it for approximately 4 years.  I also hunted a farm directly adjacent to this property which consisted of 450 acres.  This area is surrounded by old farmland as well as other stretches of forested land.  I made camp on top of a ridge that was relatively flat for the area.<BR><BR>After setting up my tent and camp, I made a fire pit (It was the dry months and I did not want to start a forest fire) and started a small fire to cook on. At approximately 9:30 PM I turned in for the night.  At around 10:00 PM I was awakened by an animal call I had never heard before.  I can only describe the sound by saying it was big and had the lung capacity of a lion or an elephant.  It literally shook the forest and my chest.  <BR><BR>I have pretty much heard everything there is to hear in the eastern forests (life long hunter and geologist  I have literally spent years in the woods) and this was so completely different there was nothing at the time I could compare it to (recently, I heard the male gorilla recording that was posted on the BFRO web site and it sounded eerily similar).  <BR><BR>At first I was unsure of what I heard because I was half asleep.  The first time I heard the call it came from about 20 yards off to my left.  15 seconds later I heard the same thing directly behind my tent still about 20 yards off.  By this time I am setting up putting on my pants and boots.  Again, about 15 seconds later, I heard the same call off to the right of my tent about 20 yards off.  My hair was literally standing on end.  At this point, I was somewhat concerned that I was not hearing my dog bark or growl.  He was sleeping outside the tent and appeared to have left.  I grab an eight inch hunting knife and a wimpy flashlight I had with me.  When I pulled the tent flap back to shine the flashlight on whatever was making the noise, I noticed my dog backing up with his tail between his legs, the hair on the nape of his neck sticking straight up growling just barely audible.  <BR><BR>He could see what was making the noise but I was unable to make out any thing besides trees with the flashlight I had.  Whatever was out there, the dog kept his eyes on it.  I believed to this day that dog would have protected me to the death.  As I have already stated the hair on my body was standing on end and I was extremely afraid (I am 6 1,  220 lbs and dont scare too easily).  I believe whatever was making the sound was doing so in a threatening manner.<BR><BR>I left all my gear and only took the knife and flashlight for protection as I hiked the mile back out of the woods.  My dog constantly looked back.  He walked beside me the whole way out and would not leave my side.  I had to cross a couple of fields and I never saw anything following us but there were also stands of trees that ran beside the fields in the direction my dog was looking.<BR><BR>After church the next day, I went back and got all my gear and it was exactly like I had left it.  There was also food that was left untouched.  I scouted the area for tracks but found none.  As already stated, I was in thick woods and there was a heavy covering of leaves and such.<BR>",

    " My sighting occurred while working as a security guard on top of a mountain in Logan WV. I was working the graveyard (11pm-7am) shift on top of the mountain at a strip mine that was closing. The company was in the process of moving all of the expensive equipment to another site. I had a little trailer as an office and several large pieces of equipment and machinery surrounded the trailer. The location was sort of in a sinkhole that had been created at the top of this mountain..due to blasting. <BR><BR>I had just made a tour of the area,checking the equipment (probably 200 square yards total) and scanning the woods that surrounded the area. It was around 3am. I found nothing unusual and went back inside the trailer and turned on the radio to listen to a talk show that I had been listening to each night. I started to put on a pot of coffee when I realized that there were no filters. A little building outside kept all the cups, filters, coffee, condiments,  etc., so I walked out to the building and grabbed a bag of filters when I heard a rustle in the brush about 20 yards behind the trailer. I went inside the trailer and grabbed my flashlight and went outside to check out the sound. At first I saw and heard nothing. Then to my right was the sound of something taking off and running through the brush toward the mountain.<BR><BR>The beam of my flashlight caught sight of what I thought, at first, to be a black bear which are quite common in this area. However, as I looked closer, I saw what appeared to be a large bi-pedal animal squatting behind a large thicket about 25 yards from where I stood. The beam from my flashlight raked across its body. It shielded its face with huge hands and then ran off into the night. <BR><BR>Thirty five to forty minutes later, while sitting in the trailer (with the door firmly locked and pistol in hand..lol)  looking out the window, I heard what can only be described as a scream that absolutely chilled me to the bone. I have goosebumps now just thinking about it. <BR><BR>This was about 16 years ago. I have tried many times to convince myself that it was a bear. Deep down I know what I saw that night was not a bear or any animal that I have ever seen or heard, before or since. I really do not know what it was that I saw that night..and have never told anyone until now because I know that most people will just think I am crazy. I don''t make any claims as to what it could be but since then I have researched the \"Sasquatch\" legend and read many books and features on the legend itself. <BR><BR>The only thing I can tell you is this; when listening to a sound recorded in Ohio (I think) it sounded almost identical to the sound that I heard that night. The sound, more than the sighting scared me the most! It was like nothing I have ever heard before or since, except the recording from Ohio. After about another hour on the hill, I got up the nerve to jump in my car and get the hell off the mountain. I never went back to work there again. <BR><BR>I talked to a guy that worked that area for years and he said that he had never seen anything but had heard some very strange screams, he attributed them to mountain lions or bobcats what I heard was no feline. Anyway, I am glad to see so many others have had similar experiences. Keep up the good work. Maybe someday we will find out just what it is that roams our mountains and forests. Who knows?<BR>",

    " It was the summer of 1975, and I was about to enter the eighth grade at Stratton Jr. High School. My best friend had moved away from our neighbor hood in Beckley to Stanaford Acres in the spring. He had invited me to come out and spend the weekend with him in hopes of planning a fishing adventure down to Piney Creek. On Saturday morning, he and a common school friend of ours, and myself ,left out on foot at approx. 7:00am. With fishing gear,lunches and other necessities in hand, we made our way through the woods, past Kliningsmiths Pond, and over to the branch that would lead us to down to Piney Creek which was about a 3 mile hike. After spending the day fishing and doing things that teenage boys do we began to head back up the mountain. As we walked and talked, moving along the rail road that snakes its way through the gorge, it became apparent to us that we may not have been alone. Eerily we all had the feeling that someone, or something, was watching us, and following us from a distance. Paranoia began to set in, and we began to pick up the pace. By the time we reached the branch that we we''re to follow back up the mountain,time was slipping away, and the thought of getting caught in the dark became apparent.After an hour or so of hiking up the branch, the sun had lazily rolled over the mountain top, and although it was still early, it was begining to get a little dusky in the hollow. We had just stopped to take a breather when we heard rustling on an old logging road about 300'' feet above us. I had an old Red Rider BB gun with me, like it would have done any good, and it was rattling in my hands has they trembled. Maybe someone was watching us. Just in a matter of minutes, large boulders, the size of a washer or drier, came down, one after the other, headed right for us. We froze like stone statues, scared to death. After regaining our composure, we let up that hill side as though our feet were not even touching the ground. Thats when, against my better judgement, I turned to look back, just in time to see a large black shape disapear over the hillside. We ran all the way to Sams house, which was still a good mile and a half away. As the years went by, we looked back on that day and laughed at one another, joking about how scared each one of us were, and tried to come up with a reasonable explaination. I don''t know if what I saw was a Big Foot, or a figment of my imagination. But to this day, any time I''m hunting or fishing, on or around the New River Gorge National River,you better beleive that I''m looking over my shoulder.",

    " I grew up in the outskirts of a small town of Wellsburg, in the northern part of West Virginia. In the northern panhandle, ever since I was little we would ride our dirt bikes in the old strip mine, that was called center hill. Well years passed and that old mine was reclaimed, well we would still ride over there even though we were not allowed. It was summer because we where out of school. Id say it was probably 1989-1990, me and a friend went trail riding. <BR><BR>There was a flat area, and along the trail was a high wall, on the other side was a drop off, and a road. We would ride that trail to the gas line and cut up over the gas line to the road and go home, or we would turn around and go back through the trails. On the way through the trails there was a pit, we called it the sulfur pit, because it would turn your clothes orange, the color of the water was orange and deep on one side and shallow on the other side. It was like the rest of the trail it butted up against the high wall. <BR><BR>On the day I''m talking about,  I was on my bike and my friend was on his 4 wheeler. We went through the pit and was playing around. We ended up getting the 4 wheeler and my bike stuck. It took a long time to recover the machines. <BR><BR>Later that day we saw something walking on the top part of the high wall. It was not walking on the edge it was walking like along a tree line. We stopped and watched this thing walk to a tree and crouch down. I dont think it knew we were there until we yelled out at it for help. <BR><BR>The guy I was with said it was a friend of ours but we were out there where no one would be walking, even during hunting season. I think he said that so I would not flip out. You dont just walk out that far even during hunting season, cause if you get something there is only two ways to bring it out, up over the high wall or down the high wall. <BR><BR>Im getting nervous just writing this... We continued to yell out to this thing with no response back from it. We yelled out the name of the person that he thought it was several times.. no answer. We even yelled out if it could come down and help us. We did not know what it was.. So probably a good hour went by, and we were still trying to get his 4 wheeler unstuck, the next thing we know this thing gets up and walks the same way it came from. It was big and had long arms down its side. Walked upright like a person. <BR><BR>We watched this thing the whole time it was there, and it watched us working. We did not know what it was or what was going to happen. We did not know what it was going to do.. After it was out of sight we went back to getting his 4 wheeler out. Finally we got his 4 wheeler unstuck and my bike and got out of there. We had to ride the same direction it had walked. A couple days later we saw our friend that was supposed to be over there and he said it was not me. After that nothing else was said about it. We rode and hunted over there a few times. I stopped riding there when I started racing. <BR><BR>A couple years later (1991) when I was a freshman in high school, I took my girlfriend at the time over there. We were just out walking, and a hill that you had to go up to get to the path that went up into the woods. We got to the top of of this hill and heard the brush move, then a grunt noise, and a growl. I turned to her and told her to walk down the hill then run. We left there as quick as we could. <BR><BR>At one point I remember being at my friends house (the same one that got his 4 wheeler stuck) and we were talking with his mom. She said to me  you know there''s a Bigfoot over in the strip mine. I said No, really?!\" She said that her son saw the foot prints. I hunted that area a few times, rode dirt bikes over there and always felt like I was being watched. I have never told no one, just in the past year I told my girlfriend of 8 years. This is the first time I have come out and told anyone my story of what I saw that day, and the other time I was over there. ",

    " It was a warm June afternoon when my dog Sadie and I went for a walk back in the woods on our property. After we walked threw the woods on our property i decided to take the gravel road the mile or so back home instead of traveling threw the woods again. I got a half mile away from the house when i kept hearing something like a rock or a branch hitting against a tree. At first i thought it was just animals or my husband goofing off in the woods to scare me. When i reached where i thought the noise was coming from i stopped and was looking up into the woods, but i couldnt see anything, so i proceed to yell, ha ha very funny because like i said i thought it was my husband. Well the banging got louder then stopped completly. I got the feeling something was watching me so i told Sadie lets go girl and started to walk a little faster. Just then a fairly sized rock came whizzing out of the woods and just missed me. I stopped looked in the woods because i couldnt believe what just happend, but i still couldnt see anything. So, i really started to pick up the pace just then another rock came flying out of the woods and just missed me. By the time all this happend i was at the bend in the road and i looked up in the hollar where the last rock had come from when something i can not explain let out the awfulest low growl then scream i have ever heard. It scared me and Sadie so bad we took off running and i dont think i felt the ground under my feet i was running so fast. I told my husband about it when i got home and realized it was not him he had been there the whole time. A few days later he convinced me to take him back where it all happend and along side the road was a foot print that was fairly large but shaped different. I have not adventured back there since then and really dont care to.",

    " My encounter happened in West Virginia at Glade Run Pond in Webster County within the Monongahela National Forest.  This is a rather remote area.  The pond is located well over a mile behind a gated forest service road off of a gravel county road that runs deep in the national forest above the Cranberry River.<BR><BR>It was likely the summer of 1985.  My best friend, Mark, and I decided to hike back to the pond to go bass fishing and camp for a couple days.  The weather was very nice and the first day had come to an end.  I had caught a bass and it was on a stringer staked to the bank of the pond.  We enjoyed a big fire (started with the aid of a Zippo can of lighter fluid), nice meal and good conversation at our own private paradise buried deep in woods.  The day ended typically with not another soul in sight.  <BR><BR>It was not long after we had lain down to for the night in our sleeping bags that we heard a bizarre howl or yell a good ways up the mountain above us.  It was like a woooooooop, woop, woop, woop sound.  It was a strong, very substantial sound.  The call was repeated a few times and then all became silent again.  We looked at each other, lightly illuminated by the campfire through the tent, and said, what was that?!  Even though we both grew up in the woods camping, hiking biking, hunting, and fishing, neither one of us had ever heard a sound like that before.  Unnerved, we eventually calmed down enough to start to fall off to sleep.  <BR><BR>Then, just inside the woods behind the tiny clearing where we were camping, we heard the call again.  It was jarring!  At a distance of less than 50 feet, the call of this creature blared though our tent!  WOOOOOOOOOOP, WOOP, WOOP, WOOP!!!  We both about died right there.  The sounds being belted out were not from an owl or fox or bobcat or any other creature we were familiar with.  Plus, this thing obviously had big with powerful lungs!  After the first couple calls, I decided that I wanted to see what was going to kill us instead of lying there like a sandwich in a wrapper.  So, I started to reach for my flashlight.  As the nylon of my sleeping bag made a slight sound, Mark clamped down on my arm like a vice grip and firmly whispered through his teeth, dont move!  I told him I wanted to see it.  Again he firmly whispered, dont move!<BR><BR>After a few minutes of bone chilling monster calls being directed toward us point blank range, all became quite again.  Eventually we felt comfortable enough to talk and could not determine what we had heard.  The only thing that we could think of was Bigfoot but the thought of it made no sense.  It took us a while, but we somehow eventually fell off to sleep.<BR><BR>The next morning we awoke in disbelief.  We reviewed our mental notes and realized that we had not shared the same nightmare but rather the same reality.  We had certainly heard something that we could not even begin to rationalize.<BR><BR>As we made our way out of the tent, the world looked the same.  It was a nice morning.  We decided to start a fire and fix some breakfast but our can of Zippo was not readily available.  Then we noticed a small pile of stones where we had left it.  Underneath the rock we discovered our lighter fluid.  Neither of us had covered the can up, and yet, there it was, covered neatly with a pyramid of rocks near the fire pit where we left it.  This was really odd since we were alone while camping in a place that is not readily accessible during the day, let alone in the night.  Plus, the covering of the can would have had to happen in the middle of the night since we were up half the night scared for our lives while the devil himself yelled at us.  We could only guess that a bigfoot had become offended by the smell of kerosene and covered it up himself.<BR><BR>A short time later we made our way down to the pond to do some fishing.  The first thing I did while down there was to check on my catch.  However, my fish was gone, stringer and all.  We each know that losing a fish and a stringer is not uncommon.  However, combined with the event, we thought that a bigfoot could have made off with our fish.<BR><BR>We each left there that day convinced that we had encountered a bigfoot at Glad Run Pond.  We have told this story over and over through the years and it still gives us chills.  My eyes even tear up a bit when I make the woooop sounds.  We each are still avid outdoorsmen.  The hours we have spent in the woods hunting and fishing and camping are substantial.  We even had mules for many years that we used for long multi-night camping and hunting trips into the WV wilds.  We still go to Glade Run Pond from time to time.  However, we have never heard that same sound or had a similar experience again.  Whatever happened that night will never be forgotten by the two of us.  We will be telling this story to our great grand children!<BR><BR><BR>",

On a mid-summer night around probably 3am, I had driven home, which was about a half hour drive. We had no neighbors and there were no lights on as I pulled up. I parked with the left side of my vehicle facing towards the wilderness line which was about 100 feet uphill. I got out of my car and closed the door. Immediately after my car door closed I had the loudest, most intense scream I have ever heard in my life call out from near the wood line. I ran for the door of the house and once inside I grabbed a shotgun, floodlight, and went back to look outside for it, from inside the screen door of course. I never saw a thing or found a sign of anything. This was the first of three times this happened to me, my mother who lived there as well and also worked late had it scream at her several times(she said 4 or 5) as well, and my brother had it scream at him once.",

    " In June I was backpacking the Allegheny Trail going south bound. I had hiked up the trail following the yellow blazes. As I got to the top and started the trek along the ridge line I noticed some of the blazes getting harder to find with what looked like attempts to scratch them off. I say this because I would find the paint chips and bark at the base of the trees. It was raining on and off with a strong wind blowing West/Northwest. The trail had quit a few blow-downs and up-roots but I also would come across smaller trees broken off or up-root laying across the trail opposite the wind direction. I was hiking toward a shelter along the trail using my map book and came upon it late in the afternoon. The following morning I was awoken by a loud noise nearby. At first I could not identity the sound but then I realized it was to Flat Creek, stones being \"clacked\" together. The sound would at first be close by and then a few seconds later would be repeated farther away until it was almost out of ear shot and then it would return getting louder and louder passing by and diminishing in the other direction. It was in a north to south direction back and forth several times and then it stopped. Soon after that I felt and heard movement on the outside of the shelter and something stepped heavily on an old plastic tarp that was left spread out along the side of the shelter at that point I yelled \" get out of here\" and I did not hear any thing more. It was very unnerving.",

    " A friend and I were out training my red-tick coon hound on Saturday Aug. 2, 2008. We drove up a familiar dirt road. We drove to the end and were on our way back when the dog had struck out of the back of the truck. I got out, turned on my mining light, and walked to the back of the truck.<BR><BR>I opened the tailgate and let the dog loose. I stood beside the truck watching the dog sniff around in the road for a minute or so. I was shining my light around in the woods around me, when I saw a set of eyes looking at me. The eyes were a bluish green color and appeared to be 5-6 foot off the ground. I stood and watched it for at least 2-3 minutes wandering what it was. I hollered at my friend who was still sitting in the passenger side of the truck to come and look and tell me what he thought it was. We both stood there watching it, trying to figure out what it was.<BR><BR>The creatures eyes would blink every now and then but it did not show any fear toward us or the dog. It was about 40 yards or so from us just enough so you could not see its body. We wanted to get a closer look so we decided to walk toward the creature. <BR><BR>We only had 1 flashlight and for us to get closer we had to cross a small ditch and a broken down fence. I was trying to hold the light on the creatures eyes, and hold the light so my friend could see so he did not fall. As we struggled to get across I noticed the eyes disappeared. We hollered for the dog to come with us and we walked approx. 40-50 yards to where the creature was standing but did not see anything. <BR><BR>We stood there for about 5 minutes talking and letting the dog sniff around, but he acted a little nervous. We started walking back to the road. When we got back to the road we were about 60 yards from behind the truck. As we were walking back to the truck, I was hollering for my dog to come on, and I shined my light up in the woods where we left from, and the set of eyes returned.<BR><BR>We looked at it for about 15 seconds then noticed a second pair of eyes this time, The second pair of eyes were orange- red color and seemed to be taller than the first set. At this time we were spooked and made our way swiftly to the vehicle. When we got to the vehicle, we got inside and I shined my light out the window and both sets of eyes were staring at us blinking and showing no fear. <BR><BR>I started up my truck and hollered for my dog to come on let''s go. The dog jumped in the bed of the truck, I jumped out, ran to the back, and hooked the dog up. I ran and got back in the truck, I shined the light out the window on the creatures, still staring at us, and my red-tick coon hound seen the creatures standing in the woods and started barking with every breath.<BR><BR>The creatures continued to stare at us blinking and showing no fear. We decided it was time to get going. We started driving down off the hill. We drove a couple hundred yards and the dog was still barking with every breath. From the way the dog was acting, I felt they were following us. I shined my light uphill beside me and sure enough, there they stood. I watched both of them follow us for about 1/2 mile.<BR>",

I''d go onto the place after the workers left for the day at 3PM.<BR><BR>It was rather hot and plain nasty so I usually headed out after 4 -5 PM. This day they were at the far end of the valley (or \"holler\" as the locals call it-I''m from CA originally). I was armed as there are wild dogs, bears, and a black panther running round back here.

I also had a very \"something is watching me\" feeling so I wasn''t what you would call happy, just taking note of where things were and enjoying the view.<BR><BR>The trail followed along this ridge and would take me near where I had all the strange feelings. I stopped as the feeling of being watched was getting a bit too much when I heard a tree fall, just on the other side of the ridge not more than about maybe seventy yards away. I was wondered just why in the hell would a tree fall but something told me not to investigate and to get off that hill.<BR><BR>I decided to turn around to call it a day. I walked maybe ten yards when something loped between two trees on the ridge to my right. My first thought was some loggers or forestry guys were still on the property. It looked to be wearing Carhart brown clothes. I went maybe twenty more yards and then it hit me: I had been on that ridge a few days before, I knew where those trees were and if, IF it was a man he had to be around seven to eight feet tall.<BR><BR>A day or two later I went back to the ridge where I saw the thing and took a good look. I never felt any real strangeness on this side and didn''t then, but I did confirm that whatever I saw was very big. I also could swear I saw the right arm and leg but not the head, thinking back it was kind of leaning forward as it walked along so the head was behind the tree when I noticed it.<BR><BR>",

    " On August 30 2012 between 9:07-9:45pm. I was traveling to my father''s home in the Moyers area of Pendleton county, WV. I decided to stop along side of a small road, county rt 25 Moyers Gap rd. I stopped half way up Hoover mountian when I heard an unusual howl sounding like three woops (I''m pretty certain it was three). Being familiar with both wild animal sounds and those of farm animals I was startled because I immediately thought of sounds I''ve heard Bobo make on the show. I cupped my hands around my mouth and attempted to recreate the sound i just heard. I gave three loud woop sounds in medium tempo. After about 5-10 seconds I heard two woop sounds coming from the same direction as the first down over the mountain to my left. Again I cupped my hands and let out two loud woop sounds in about the same tempo as i had just heard. This time I heard a sharp crack of wood and a different type of howl, it sounded angry or frustrated maybe? to me. Unfortunately, a white gmc pick up truck began coming down the mountain. The loud crack and howl were the last sounds I heard that night. I waited for about 45 minutes in the truck I was driving, several times I attempted to get responses by making woop sounds none of my calls were returned again. I was so excited by this encounter. I will never forget it",

    " A buddy of mine and I had wanted to hike and camp in the Dolly Sods Wilderness in West Virginia, in the Monongahela forest. Basically, it was a weekend camp, hoping to spot game and look for trout water. Any thoughts of Bigfoot, (there had been previous reports) were largely in the back of my mind, although the prospect of possibly encountering or seeing evidence was exciting to consider. <BR><BR>The area is quite remote, and the terrain fairly rugged. We had parked the truck on a forest service road, and hauled our gear into the woods. We spent the early afternoon scouting about, after pitching our tent in a small glen surrounded by pine trees. We spotted some deer and raccoon tracks along an adjacent small stream, and looked for whatever sign we could find, then headed back to camp. As we sat there, the atmosphere of such wilderness led my thoughts to Bigfoot. To amuse myself, I got up and started to peruse the woods a bit. About that time, I heard footsteps behind me and turned to see a couple of men walking down a trail carrying garbage bags on their backs. They stopped at our camp and my buddy and I talked with them a few minutes. They had been collecting ramps. Ramps are like wild onions. And they had a good haul, about 40 lbs worth between them. Half jokingly and half serious I asked them if they had heard tales of Bigfoot in the area. Their eyes kind of flew open for a second, then they gave me a look like I was crazy. They didn''t say anything for a few seconds, then looked down at the ground, kind of averting their eyes. I quickly told them about the reports I''d read, but they seemed like they didn''t want to discuss anything. We talked a bit more about ramp selling and Appalachian festivals and such; and I asked them where the ramp patch was and they told us it was on the backside of the hill fronting our tent. Soon they had to leave, but curiously enough, as they were walking away, one of the men turned and said, \"Y''all watch fer them Bigfoot now!\" in a matter-of-fact kind of way. Well, after awhile, my buddy and I decided to take a little foray up one of the trails, and had an enjoyable time--spotting hawks, many birds, bobcat sign, squirrels, and even a Great Horned Owl. We also heard a Barred Owl. We sat in the woods and talked, and planned to do some predator calling after nightfall. I think it was about six o''clock by this time, so we headed back to camp get something to eat. We rustled up some food without cooking anything and the sun was lowering, the night was soon to be coming on. We were debating where we should go try to predator call. Not long after, I head what I can only describe as howls and chatter-like sounds emanating from behind a hill. My buddy had gone back to the truck to get a flashlight we had left behind. As I listened, I could differentiate three separate sources for the sounds. It seemed like they were near each other, not calling to each other from a distance. I also noted that hound dogs were barking off to my right and in behind me from maybe a half-mile away. The howl-like sounds lasted only 30 seconds or so. I just sat there astounded. My buddy soon showed up, and I asked him if he had heard anything. \"Hound dogs\" he replied. I didn''t say anything more to him about it, because I thought he might think I was gettin''nervy. Anyhow, I was primed for excitement that night. After supper, we sat up until late listening to the sounds of the night. Nothing unusual happened. Finally, went to sleep, but I''ll admit I was catnapping most of the night. The next day passed much as the previous one, spotted wildlife and nice hike up to the \"plains\", and then back to camp. We milled about the camp area, and planned to predator call that night....After predator calling, without much response except for two owls, we cooked up some ramps and potatos and talked ''til about midnight. We never bothered to make a fire. After the day''s hiking, a good sleep was welcome. About 2:30 a.m. I was awakened by the sound of our cookware being rattled. I lay there listening, and heard a buck snort. Then he stamped several times. The buck was after the ramps we had leftover from supper. Alright, I thought, back to sleep. I lay there waiting to drift off, listening to the buck mill about the camp. Then, I heard the buck snort loudly. Suddenly, I got an innate sense that something sizable was peering at the tent...I felt a presence there in the pines, which were about 15 feet away. The buck, after slowly moving away, finally bounded away from the glen. I fumbled around for the flashlight, not wanting to awaken my buddy. I couldn''t locate it. Of course, I was still listening intently for whatever was there in the pines. I heard no movement. But that feeling of being scrutinized was raising the hair on my neck. I deliberated what to do. I had no weapon, except a machete. No means of startling what I felt had to be Bigfoot. It was just standing there, there was no discernable movement. I was ''paralyzed'' as to what to do. Finally, I decided to do nothing, just lay there. I''ve had bears sniffing my tent and checking out my campsites before, and found that not confronting them is a good policy. I lay there waiting to see what would happen next. Maybe five minutes later, I heard tree branches moving and a few twigs snap. Then, nothing...I drifted off to sleep. Next morning, I awoke eager to check out the pine stand and campsite. I told my buddy about the buck visit, and decided to tell him about the strange presence lurking in the pines. He listened without saying anything. I wanted to look around, and evidently my buddy''s curiosity got the best of him, and he joined the search. After a few minutes, I found a footprint. It was about 16 inches long and maybe 5-6 inches wide. The big toe was quite clear, and the other ones just slightly less defined. The big toe was maybe two inches wide. The soil where the footprint was dry, kind of grainy not loamy. It was hard-packed and there were pine needles surrounding. The footprint was visible but not deep in the soil. My buddy was quite intrigued by the footprint. We talked about what I had experienced, and dawdled over the footprint. But, it became evident my buddy didn''t believe tht Bigfoot had made the footprint. Or better stated he wouldn''t accept what he was looking at. He even smudged the toes to make it undiscernable. Of course, I was caught off guard by that and made somewhat peeved.<BR><BR>Further thoughts: In retrospect, I feel kind of stupid for not having tried to look at the creature. At the time, I thought I was doing the right thing, it could have precipitated an attack. However, I could sense the largeness of what had to be Bigfoot. *I noticed the breathing,the inhalations of the creature as well, which further informed me of its size. ",

My daughter and her son left around 3:30 so it was just my son and I and the 2 dogs. He fly fished and I just relaxed and read at camp.<BR>At dusk we started a fire, ate and had a glass of wine.  I did a couple wood knocks but did not hear a response. Around 9:00 we went to our tents with a dog in each for the night. At 1:30 in the morning the dogs needed out to do their business so we did also then back to bed. My son snores terribly so my sleeping was intermittent. Our tents were between two trees about 8 feet apart and a foot from each other and the trees. I awoke sometime in the night and raised up because I heard the dog moving around. He was staring out the window towards the Lake. He did this several times that night, didn''t bark or growl. I heard nothing that night except my son and the dogs snoring.<BR><BR>September 15<BR>Awoke early and we decided to take a hike to Blankenship Lakes and Meadow. Spooked a Rough Grouse on the way and met 2 Bow Hunters on the trail. They had no luck but said where they were camped at Blankenship was busy with coyotes during the previous night. When we reached the Lake one of the dogs Maggie would not leave Bob''s side so we continued on. Got back to camp around noon.<BR>When dusk arrived we made a fire and I decided to do a call, one loud Whoop and immediately across the lake we got a return whoop and Elk on both sides of the lake started bugling back and forth to each other. Also a coyote yip then it was quiet for awhile and then more Elk bugles and a loud knock on the hill behind our tents.<BR>By this time my son was wide eyed and couldn''t believe what he was hearing. I had told him of all of my expeditions and reports from others so he was a believer but had never experienced it for himself. We decided to go to bed and he immediately went to sleep snoring right away. I on the other hand was awake and listening when I felt something heavy stepping on the side of my tent where my arm was lying , I slowly moved my arm not making a sound because I didn''t want whatever it was to know I wasn''t sleeping. I felt my head being pushed down also as it went by and a loud swoosh on the tent fly. I was petrified and tried to call out \"Go Away\" but nothing came out. I was mute, but continued to try and say something to wake my son up. He and both dogs were snoring. After it passed my tent I continued to hear soft bipedal footfalls around our camp. I did not sleep all night. Around dawn I heard another wood knock. We got up , packed up and left. Very memorable trip for us, shook me up but I still want to have a sighting and will keep doing this.<BR><BR>Note: Actual names edited by the investigator in order to protect the identity and privacy of the witnesses.

    " I have never told this to anyone because I didn''t want to hear the jokes, but it was mid July 1987.  I was heading toward the beach in my sports car, top down music blasting.  It was around 8:45 pm so it was still light, sort of dusk dark.  I had my headlights on cruising about 60 mph  when I rounded a corner and there in the road stood this large hairy thing.   I slammed on brakes and swerved around it, but I must have glanced it because it bounced over the passenger side of my car.   I slid the car around and stopped where my headlights were about halfway on the thing.   It got up and came at me.  I was about 25 feet away from the thing and the smell was horrible. It hung in the air like a wet blanket.   It was about 7 to 7.5 feet high, reddishbrown matted looking hair,  its face was hairless and he looked ticked.   I put the car in reverse, backed up and threw the car in drive and took off.  As I was spinning around I looked in the rearview mirror and it was right on my cars rear end.  I heard a loud bang. About that time my car caught traction and took off.  I left the creature running down the road after me.  I have never been so scared in all my life.  After I got to my destination I checked my car.  The passenger rear quarter panel  was dented in with hair on it.  And my rear spoiler was shattered where he had hit the rear of my car.    I told my friends, family, police and insurance that I had hit a stray cow.  But it took weeks to get that smell off of the outside of my car and the inside still had that smell.   It was a under smell, like sewage and something else.  I was 27 then, I''m 38 now.  I have not been down that road since.   I will drive 45 to 50 miles out of my way not to go that route.",

    " Shortly after laying down for the night during a backpacking trip in the Nantahala Wilderness, we heard a howl that lasted 10-15 seconds, with a change of tone for the last few seconds. This howl could not have been mistaken for any other animal and sounded very similar to recordings of other howls. In the next 2 hours we both heard random whoops also.  The next day while hiking we came across several very interesting signs along the trail. The first was spotting what looked like a game trail that crossed the hiking trail. Upon closer inspection, the tracks in the well traveled trail clearly were not made by bear or any other four legged animal.  The footprints on the trail had left deep impressions where the heel contacted the ground and footprints much larger than my foot were also seen.  The distance between the tracks was approximately 5 feet on average and the depth of the tracks where the heel had sunk down was 3 plus inches.   The ferns and weeds in the trail that had been pressed down were still green and flat which made me think the tracks had been made within the past couple of days. I followed the trail in both directions for approximately 150 yards and the footprints remained consistent in both directions.  After traveling the hiking trail further down the ridgeline for close to mile I spotted another trail that crossed the hiking trail. The footprints here were identical to what we saw at the first trail. I took pictures to gauge the depth and length of the prints.  I found a stick on this trail that had blood on it.  I regret not keeping it for evidence to see what type of blood it was.  The location of both trails had some similarities: both were located in gaps along the ridgeline and there was an unusually high amount of limbs and trees wedged in tree forks at both sites.  One other strange observation made along the trail was finding 3 large white mushrooms placed upside down near the trails. One of these was on a rock and another was found on the trail while following the footprints.  The area where we found these signs was the direction where we had heard the howl the night before.  <BR>",

    " I am recalling this story that I was told by my sister-in-laws father.<BR><BR>He and I were working together on a job in Georgetown, SC in 1983.  On Friday evenings he usually left work to drive to his home in Upstate South Carolina, about 3 hours away.  His journey took him through isolated areas with dense forest.  One particular Friday evening he left on his trip a little later than normal.  He told me that it had been raining earlier and was slightly foggy.  There was very little traffic on the road this night.  As he was driving through one of the more densely wooded areas he came up behind a car that he followed for a couple miles.  This is where the event took place.  He told me that as he was following this car, that suddenly the car swerved and skidded off the side of the road.  He did not know what had happened due to the road was unusually straight and no other traffic was in the area.  He at the time was a volunteer rescue worker and knew someone might need medical help.  He quickly pulled his truck off the road behind the car and went to see if anyone was hurt.  He found two older ladies in the car, quiet shaken up but unhurt.  They were very excited and asked him if he saw the thing that had run in front of their car.  He did not know what they were talking about.  They said that a deer first crossed the road in front of them and then a large black-haired creature almost ran into their car.  It appeared to be chasing the deer.  They swerved to avoid hitting whatever it was.  He had not seen the animal they described, but offered assistance in helping get their car back onto the road.  Since it had been raining they couldn''t back up in the wet grass. He told them he had some rope and would pull them with his truck. As he went around to the back of his truck to get the rope to pull their car with, he walked straight into whatever it was that was chasing the deer.  He said it was just over six foot tall, with dark wet long hair and much wider than an average man.  He told me that it smelled like stinking raw meat and had fiery red eyes.  It was standing immediately behind his truck and as he rounded the truck he walked right into it. He stood his ground not sure of its intentions. It turned and walked a short distance to the edge of the woods and stopped again.  It made a sort of low growling noise. Then it slowly turned and walked into the woods.  Shaken, he helped the ladies with their car and continued on his journey.  He admitted that it didn''t really dawn on him what he had just seen, until he was back in the truck driving again. He had to pull over and settle himself.  When he returned to work on Monday, he asked if I had also traveled home that weekend.  I told him that I hadn''t.  He was very hesitant to tell me about his encounter, thinking I would tell others and have people think he was off his rocker. I could tell that whatever he had seen had surely upset him.  He was very emotional telling me about his encounter, which has stuck in my mind ever since. I''ve only shared this story with a couple of people over the past 17 years.  Most people think you''re nuts when a grown man starts telling Bigfoot stories.  After seeing your website I decided that I should share this with the experts.",

We had heard noises all evening near the building where we were working. When we were leaving (around 10:00 P.M.) My friend pushed me aside and said to look towards a certain location. He saw something, or someone, that was looking at us. He had a rifle and shot into the air. Whatever or whoever it was, it ran. It was BIG! All I could observe about it was its large-stepping gait and how it managed to run through all the cars and bushes without hitting one thing in its path!!",

    " <BR>      Years ago, my brother, two cousins and I were at a creek near my father''s place of business when we decided to go swimming.  After 20 or thirty minutes of this, I decided to lie on the sand about 20 yards from the creek bank.  All of a sudden, my three companions came running by me and told me to \"get up and run!\"  I did this, but I looked back at the creek.  All I could make out was a large, hairy figure leaning on a large tree trunk beside the creek.  We ran for a couple hundred yards and up a very steep bank to get away from this creature.  This bank was a support for a railroad track and was nearly straight up for about 50 feet.  It was lined with pine trees about twelve feet tall.  When we reached the top of the bank we thought that we were safe.  Not so!  We heard what sounded like a horse running towards us.  Whatever it was started up the embankment at a high rate of speed.  It pushed the pine trees out of the way.  It had to be extremely strong to move them the way that it did.  We had no option except to jump on the other side of the hill into briars and vines and \"run for our lives.\"  We told our dad, but after looking at the area, he decided not to contact the police.  My brother said it was large and hairy.  He said that it looked like pictures in books that we had seen.  I have told this story for years.  I still get chills thinking about this experience!   ",

    " Hello, what I''m going to descibe is real and nothing less.<BR> <BR> My friend told me about this web site.<BR> I''m going to tell you my story to the tee !<BR> Saturday the 21 of 07, two friends of mine went to the coastal region of S.C. on a relic hunt involving metal detectors in search of civil war relics.<BR> I met them at a boat landing on the Ashepoo river to unload the boat for a 30 min boat ride in alligator infested water.<BR> Ariving at or destination we tied up the boat to a tree on the bank of the river. I''ve hunted  here in the past during winter and encountered large boar.<BR> It was very hard getting into the clearing because there is a narrow track of land with a 1700''s slave dug dike on the right and on the left is a swamp that used to be probably rice or cotton feilds.<BR> We got into the opening if you want to call it that compared what we went through to get there.<BR> We had two way radios set them up to the right channel so we could stay in touch in case of getting lost.<BR> Well after hunting for about 2 hours I heard a boar grunt which Im very familiar with from hunting in remote places , I ignored it and kept hunting.<BR> A few min later I meet up with one of my partners and I asked him where Pete was so he got on the radio. Pete replied he was left of our posisioun about a mile.  He went looking for new spots to hunt, I looked at Dennis and decided to take a 5 min break because of the intense heat, but sitting still we were swarmed with skeeters.<BR> Dennis went to check out some large oaks on a hill. So I went right in some pines were the slave cabins were, about ten minites later I heard a loud \" WOOP\". I took my head phones off and ducked thinking first instinct that some one else was out there, but again I heard it load as day \"WOOP\" , it was definately- repeat- definately ape sounding. Then I heard a large stick hit a tree three times about 100 yards away. Then about 15 to 20 seconds later I heard it again hittng another tree. This time it was further off towards the river. Before I heard anything I smelled a foul stench in the breeze but thats not concrete evidence because of the dead boar I found in the past.  I do believe in bigfoot and was happy this happend to me. I was not scared one bit but did get goose bumps.<BR> I could see someone''s mind play tricks on them if they were actually out looking for them but I was concentrating on finding relics.<BR> I just cant fully desribe the sound it was so deep and DEFINATELY APE.<BR> I hope yall take full instrest in this as much as I do.

    " It happen back in 1985 or 86 im not really sure it happen so long ago. It was on a friday after school i went to my friend''s house for the weekend. they move down from ohio. <BR><BR>We were real good friend so on friday night we were watching about bigfoot on t.v you know about the patterson film and other knowen sightings and how he or she screams, i got goose bumbs from watching it so on saturday night about 8:30p.m it was the summer so we had the door''s open and we were watching t.v and all of a sudden we heard this high pitch scream so we listen again because we thought we were hearing things and there it goes again so we walk outside and sat at the picnic table and we heard it again, so we just sat there. <BR><BR>Just could''nt believe it all of us had goose bumbs so his dad went in the house and grab a flashlight and his gun .22 rifle to be on the safe side he came out and all three of us started walking down the road into the field (about 300 yards from the house). At the same time we kept hereing this thing screaming one minute high and the next minute low. <BR><BR>I think we were all scared so we walk near the river and his dad shine the flashlight into the brush and there staring at us were these (red eyes). We heard trees limbs breaking so we took off running back to the house (because we were''nt standing around to see what it really was) so we got back at the house and his mom asked what did we see and we told her we saw these (red eyes) staring at us. We all had goose bumbs talking about it i just could''nt believe it so we heard the screaming for about 3 or 4 hours after we saw the (red eyes). <BR>The next morning we were still talking about it so around 12:00 noon we walk back over to see if any tracks was around. We saw this grape vine i would say it was about 5 or 7 inches around was just snapped in two like it was nothing and they were bark tornen off the tree at least 8 to 9 feet tall and the ground was torning up as will and we could make out a foot print just the back of it heal about 9 or 10 inches wide and about two inches deep. <BR><BR>We just could not believe it and we talk about all that day and still to this day i still get goose bumbs and the hair raises up on my arms. I do believe bigfoot is around some where.we have not seen it or heard it again. <BR><BR>",

When they described it for their country it was just like how we here stateside would describe it. One of the biggest things they mentioned about thought was the howl. They said that their howl sometimes sounds almost like a laugh. I would describe it as a Mexican war cry. A lot of our equipment over there has IR capabilities and your jaw would drop if you could see some of the images we capture on camera. They are so large on the camera that closest thing it would resemble would be a bear, but I dont think bears are in the Helmand Province of Afghanistan.

    " It was roughly around the end of August 2011 and I was at my mothers house. The house is located in the Burnt Hickory area of Paulding County, GA. She lives in a subdivision but it is still out in the country. I have always been and still a night owl. I stepped out on her back deck around 0200 in the morning to have a cigarette. Behind her house is nothing but trees, shrubs, hills, and creeks. There is an abundance of wildlife in the area that range from deer to coyotes. I was a Reconnaissance Marine for 8 years with multiple deployments to both Iraq and Afghanistan. I have been to numerous survival schools all over America from Maine to California. Most of my life was spent in the woods and I understand what animals make what sounds. I do not unnerve very easily. So back to my story. I was on the back deck smoking a cigarette when I heard this loud howl/scream. The first howl grabbed my attention instantly. Because I had only heard it one time I was unsure what it was. So I listened with a bit more interest the second time and I was trying to run everything through my mind to to figure out what it was. I knew it was not a deer or coyote because the howl was so deep. So then I started to think about my surroundings. There is a highway a couple miles away so I thought it may have been a big rig/semi. Then I heard it again. That option was completely ruled out. So I started to think of what else it could be. Perhaps it was a generator running in the woods. Again I heard the howl. Not a generator! I had run through so many different scenarios that I was starting to get freaked out. The howl was from a living creature and it was much larger than I. Each howl lasted approx. 5 seconds with a 10-15 second rest before the next. I stood out there for about 5 minutes before listening to this before I was to freaked and headed inside. I immediately ran up to my computer and googled howling sounds in Paulding County, GA. There were several websites regarding howling in the area but most of them were referring to Picketts Mill Battlefield. Then I came across BFRO. Initially I was like \"yeah...okay!\". I started looking through the website and I came across some of the audio submissions from Ohio. Once I heard it I nearly crapped my pants. That howl was to a T of what I heard. The only difference was mine sounded much deeper, closer, and I didn''t have dogs barking in the background. I still get goosebumps thinking about it. I read through some of the other posts from Paulding County and Bartow County. What they all had to say was pretty freaky. Then I looked at the time frames they were made and where. During those time frames there was construction in the area. And when I heard my sounds they had just recently begun construction in the area. Not sure if there is any connection with that. I did bring it up to my wife the next day and she could hear the fear in my voice as I talked about it. Anyone that has been willing to listen I have mentioned it to. ",

    "I have lived on this land for a decade. I have always kept dogs in a fenced in yard that borders the wooded area of the property. At just after 1:30 am I awoke to my dogs barking in a very agressive manner. I got out of bed to go and shut them up, thinking that it was likely just a dog or deer that was wandering through the woods at night. It was nearly a full moon this night. I should add here that in the ten years I have lived here I have never seen a human in the woods behind my home.I stepped out onto the back porch in my underwear and yelled at the dogs. This is where it got very different from all the countless times I had quieted them in the past. I yelled,\"Alright, ya''ll chill out. People are sleeping....\" and before I finished the sentence I heard footsteps, NOT of a four legged variety, but one very methodically after the other.This got my full attention.I have a storage building at the back corner of my yard. My first thought was that somebody must be trying to break into it. It sits in the very back corner of the fence and could be accessed by hopping over a four foot chain link fence.I went back inside to grab a flashlight and my 9mm pistol, but as I went back in the door I heard a sort of scream/shreik. It was very loud and actually made me jump a bit. I was thinking it was likely teenagers at this point, likely shouting some sort of insult, but there was something unnerving about the way it carried into my home. I told my girlfriend, who was stirring back to being awake, that there was somebody walking in the woods making weird noises and that she needed to come hear it for herself and I am going to run them off. I ran back onto the porch and shouted,\"Whoever you are, I am going to let these dogs out so you''d better speak and be on your way!\" No response came back, but the footfalls were obviously close to the fenceline and were heavy sounding. I went over to the gate and the dogs would not leave the yard or my side. This is the first time ever that I have witnessed them refuse a chance to run in the woods. At this point I was a bit angry and embarrassed that I had made a threat to the intruder and the dogs just stayed put.This was when my whole world was tilted on it''s ear. I shouted that \"I am about to come out there and find you and when I do I am going to shoot you\", figuring that this would make whoever it was haul thier ass out of there. As I yelled this thing went from one end of my yard, around the corner of the fence to up near the front of my yard in less than 15 seconds with a very distinct two legged sound, loud and heavy. In broad daylight I could not duplicate this speed in twice the time. There are obstacles everywhere that you will bust your butt out there.I had no intention of going into the woods in my underwear and barefooted so I chambered a round and fired three shots into the ground with the fourth being a misfire that I quickly cleared. At that moment something started shrieking and howling at extremely high decible levels and was coming closer...not running away, but running towards the side of the front of the house where I was standing. My girlfriend was up on the side porch and was asking,\"What the hell is that?\" and then, even though I was between her and the woods, she said she was going back in the house.Normally when an animal is in the woods I can trick it into looking into the flashlight by making a high pitched noise or whistle, thereby giving me a look at its position.This time, this thing never revealed its eyes to me. I found that to be very unusual. I have to add here that I was physically shaking at how much noise this thing made and how heavy it sounded as it kept howling/wailing/screaming and moving around in the treeline just beside my fence.I am 6''4\", 290 pounds and I am not fat. My friends often joke that I am a shaved sasquatch. I am 41 years old and have worked as a bouncer/babysitter in bars from the nicest type, all the way down to the nudie bar hell-holes. I am NOT an easy man to intimidate! Whatever was moving out there was MUCH bigger than me, as well as much faster. I moved up onto the side porch to be ready to flee from whatever the hell it was. I would be lying if I said otherwise here. I was badly shaken by this thing.Being unable to see it while it was so close was chilling my blood.When I got to the porch and up the stairs (both porches are about five feet above ground) it moved back away into the woods, likely a couple of hundred feet. How do I know this? I heard it as it went, one step after another, then I and my girlfriend who was standing just inside the side porch door, hear what seemed to be heavy timber being smacked or knocked together. It came in a sucession of three \"whumps\" each time, which really unnerved me, as I had just fired three rounds. Coincidence or not, it was like it was letting me know it was aware of what I just did and replicated this three knocks/slams each time and would pause for a few seconds between doing so again.It stopped doing this and I shouted out again, this time saying something to the effect of \"Who are you?\", and then I heard it moving back this way yet again. It moved so fast that it really defies anything logically explained away and again, the very heavy and rhythmic sound of one foot after another was very audible. I was only shouting at this point because in the back of my mind I WANTED to hear a human voice or laughter from kids.....anything but that god awful howl again. I was hoping for a known explanation or reason for the sounds to be as loud as they were, like maybe a recording played through a bullhorn or something, but I knew that this was something very different. My mind was refusing to believe that this was real, yet there I was hearing it for myself.At this point my girlfriend was pleading for me to come back inside so she could lock the doors. I went inside and put on some pants and shoes, dug the video camera out and turned off all the lights on the backside of the house. I wish I had taken it out the first time, but I believed that it was a prowler or vandal at first so there was not reason to take a camera...a gun and flashlight are my two best bets in that case. I truly regret not having it with me when this thing started making those sounds.I crept down the stairs to the yard in the darkness. I sat there for a while and then decided to move over toward the fenceline by the side porch. Just then , from the woods there came those damned footfalls again. I was in the dark (I had a flashlight too, but I did not want to reveal my position) and this thing was shadowing my movements from the left to the right of the yard, staying an equal distance it seemed outside the fence.This I did for over an hour with it moving every single time I did. I would remain stationary for five to ten minutes each time. At one point I thought I heard my dogs down in my storage shed. I figured they went in there to bed down. I walked back up my stairs to go inside and my blood ran cold when I realized that both dogs were cowering in my living room. I had not pulled the door closed behind me when I went outside, and they had to be physically removed from the house to the back porch.That has also never happened before. At this point I actually went into my workroom and grabbed a thick peice of wood and cut it to bar the back door from sliding open. In the decade I have lived here I have NEVER had a lock on my back door due to the fact that there were always dogs in the yard who hate everything that is not me or my family. Nobody goes in the back yard. I thought about calling the sherriffs department, but what could I tell them? I am afraid a bigfoot is pissed at me and is after me? I don''t think so. It just sounds too damned crazy!That all happened the first night.The next day I was mad that I was so afraid the night before. I had two rechargeable spotlights, but neither one was working that night, bulbs or batteries were bad...who knows.I went to Home Depot and bought a 2.25 million candlepower spotlight and went home that afternoon. I have hunted all my life, so I thought I would rig up some light along my fenceline near the shed and if it came back I would flip a switch and turn night into day and maybe get a look at this thing as it fled the light into the same dark corner of my lot, at which point I would light it up with the 2.25 million candlepower light.My girlfriend walked to the shed with me and I went to the fence to position the light. As I got to the fence I was talking to her, saying,\"If I put it here it should run it back to the other side...\" and there it was. I saw with my own eyes. Between two trees and some brush, there was a 3x3 foot section of long brown fur, clearly visible and moving slightly. I yelled, \"There it is!\" and although my girlfriend thought I was kidding, she saw the bushes as they were being parted as something moved rapidly into the more dense growth. It was not a bear. It was not a dog. It was too massive. I think I saw the rounded back of this animal as it sort of \"duck-walked\" away towards a creekbed. It was gone in a matter of seconds and I was not going to chase it.We were standing there in total disbelief. The damned thing was STILL there the next day in broad daylight. It just seemed too surreal to believe. Was it waiting for me? We waited for a while and never heard anything move. It was in there and it was trying to hide.We walked around to the front part of the shed and that is when we noticed two odd things.One was that there is black water bubbling up from the ground and it has a very strong smell to it. This is on the other side of the yard from where my septic lines should be as well as uphill from it. I am wondering if this smell drew this thing in close to my home. Secondly was the spookiest of all. There is a footprint in my yard that measures 15 inches in lentgh right by my fence where it seems like it stepped over into the woods. It is in the soggy part near the blackwater. I tried to replicate it myself with my size 14''s but the difference is huge. It seems to have a rounded heel and toes seem to be visible. I do not know if plaster will set there due to this new mystery spring that has crept up, but I covered it with a paint rollor trey to protect it from the dogs walking on it.I do not see how it could be from anyone but me in this yard, and once again, I cannot duplicate it. I hope there is an explanation for this print other than a friggin sasquatch in my yard.There is also a branch broken in my yard at the ten to twelve foot height on a fresh limb that we just noticed. The thought of it coming over the fence into my \"safe zone\" is a little more than I want to believe right now.I went exploring the woods today with a friend who told my that he has read that sometimes sticks or big limbs will be stacked in a triangle or pyramid fashion. We found at least seven such things back in that area along and around the creekbed, some of which were from a species of tree that is nowhere near the site. These do not seem to be anything that naturally would happen if a branch falls. I do not know if these are significant or not. I also found a five inch diameter tree that has been knocked down with all the roots intact and not enough vegitation on it to account for the wind having done it.This is just on the other side of my fence, right behind my shed.",

Just southwest there are a series of creeks and waterways that lead into the woodlines behind a couple of small farms, one of which has horses on it.The incident took place in the woods just behind and around my home.The land behind my home has a natural series of creekbeds and it grows very thick in the summer.The area is heavily wooded with many low areas at the back of the four acres I live on. One acre is fenced in and clear cut. The rest is natural growth. The area, although being developed for housing, is still seated in a lot of heavy wooded terrain.",

    " A relative recently built a house in a slighty remote southern area of Upson County. The property of about 50 acres has a small lake which has been there for about 30 years.  A few miles south is lots of wooded areas, and the county is bordered by the Flint River.<BR><BR>Around June 15, 2004, about 10:00 A.M  one mostly cloudy, but hot and humid morning, I arrived at her house to plant some flowers in her flower bed.  I had been there about 45 minutes and had taken a break to drink some water when I heard a sound that I had never heard before, but knew for sure that whatever it was, had power behind it. It really got my attention since I was alone at the time.  I listenned for about 2 more minutes and I heard the sound again much clearer and could tell that it seemed to be coming down towards the lake.  The lake can''t be seen from the house.  This creature called Bigfoot automatically came to my mind because I knew it had to be powerful to produce that sound.  I left immediately because I was frightened and came home to look on the internet for bigfoot sounds.  I found on the Oregon Bigfoot site the sound.  the first 2 screams on the \"Puyallup Screamer\" file is exactly what I heard.  I told my cousin''s roommate that I had heard something and she said immediately that I should talk to my cousin because she had heard it too. ",

    " I was hiking the Appalachian Trail in July of 2005 and I stopped to spend the night at the Gooch Mountain shelter.   There was a hiker there at 16:00 but he left around 18:00 to get in a few more miles. <BR><BR>It was a normal night on the AT until around 2:30 in the morning. I was awakened by a very heavy rustling sound. I immediately jumped up in the sleeping bag thinking it was a bear. I was sleeping in the loft upstairs, for just this reason, and I had seen a bear earlier that day. <BR><BR>When I shined my headlamp out the front of the shelter there came a tremendous whooping sound. It was a mmoooooopp. It was pitch dark and dead silent except for this tremendous whoop. I was almost painful to the ears it was so loud. I could not see anything. <BR><BR>The sound seemed to be about 50 feet away and moved from left to right out of range of my headlamp repeating this loud whoop. <BR><BR>There were no other sounds in the woods, nothing, not even the crickets or frogs until 3 or 4 minutes after the sound stopped. I did not sleep the rest of the night. I looked in the morning and found no evidence of a bear, raccoon, or other animal, but the ground was very hard and dry. The sound came from the area where I had my food hanging in a tree away from the shelter.<BR><BR>I am a big guy, ex-military and spend a lot of time hiking and surviving in the woods. I have never heard anything close to this sound from any animal I have ever encountered. I do not scare easy but this had me really shaken. I watched a show on The Discovery Channel (I think) a while back and they played a supposed recording of a Bigfoot, then I realized this was exactly what I heard. Until that time I had dismissed the event.",

    "Not in the same Area, Also Back in 2002 just outside of Crested Butte Colorado. Some friends of mine and I were camping just off the forest service Just a few miles past a little three or four building area called Gothic. We were there to do some mountain biking. We had gone back in to Crested Butte to eat after we set up camp. Like I said we were camping on a clearing just of the side of the road. When we got back to camp we all just went to bed, after all we were there to bike and had driven from Colorado Springs most of the day to get there. At About 01:00am I heard this whistling noise. Coming from three directions. Ill try to describe. Lets just say my head was laid in in the 12 oclock position. The first whistle came from my 10 oclock, then another one at my 12, and the third fired off from my 4 oclock. Scared my to death. I woke my friend that was in the tent with me to see if she knew what could be making that noise. She just listened said she didnt know and back to sleep she went. I didnt dare stick my head out the tent. This went on for about 2 to 3 minutes. I had just laid my head back down when I could running, (and I mean I could hear it) through the woods. I could tell it was Bipedal . I thought what kind of bird can run that fast, Thats the only thing I could think of that would be out in the Colorado wilderness at 1am that was whistling an running on two legs. Then in 2005 when I was watching a video on MTV from the Bestie Boys, is when I started looking up Bigfoot on the Internet. You see in this video there was a Sasquatch that had abducted the group, anyway I said Bigfoot lets Google him. Found your site and Oregon Bigfoot. On the Oregon site in the sound area I clicked on the Sierra Growl. When the clip gets to where the whistle part is. I like to _hit myself. That is what I heard. But if you take your mouse and use it where you can repeat just that whistle over and over well then you have heard exactly what I heard.",

I heard what sounded like heavy wood knocks. Big loud ones. At the time I just thought maybe someone was building something off in the woods. But now Im more inclined to believe that it could have been a Sasquatch. Because there was nothing but woods, and fields in the section of the road where I heard the noises come from. I havent rode out there in a long while either so nothing further to report. My friend that I was riding with would have no recall of the incident. Like I said just sounded like building going on. ",

    " Been hearing a lot of knocking in the woods close behind my house. It''s very loud, and has a repeated pattern like as follows: one loud solid hit, 3 quick taps, then another loud solid hit. Both my father and I have heard this as we are just walking outside. <BR><BR>The scary incidents have happened to me 3 different nights in the weeks prior. Tonight was the most scary as I had at least 3 around my house. I have been knocking back and whistling, to no avail, but sitting out on the back patio I can hear the walking, limbs being broken as it walks. Then everything is quiet, as if they have reached the edge of the wood line and are watching me. <BR><BR>A few times I''ve sought to entertain them, I''d do silly stuff or whistle a tune. The night before I was met with three limbs being cracked within 30 mins. This was too frequent to be natural. I have tried to get trail cam video, no luck. But the nights when I''m by myself and I go out as per usual. They''re already there and waiting on me. Tonight I tried something different, I decided to just casually sit facing the woods and talk to them. I''d just say that I was their friend and I meant them no harm. As I talked, the woods lit up with noise. I was being approached from 3 different directions. But the largest one concerned me, I could hear limbs breaking as it got closer. I had a flashlight but was reluctant to shine it until I was freaked out, the thing was too close. I lit it up. What I could see appeared to be a very large animal not quite to the edge, and colors making it almost indistinguishable from the woods. But the eyes, oh man, they shined bright green. I would''ve thought it to be a critter only they were spaced about 5 inches apart and I could make out the outline of something squatting, just starting right at me not even blinking. This thing was huge, it nearly made me run seeing it. I turned the light off and went the hell inside. I checked again an hour later, and still could hear it walking around out there. <BR><BR>This is something that has happened to me numerous times, and every time I''m alone I can get a response from them. But if I have someone with me they do not show. There are definitely bigfoots in Adel. And I have some that come to my backyard. There''s been only one incident of the house being smacked during the night. And I''ve noticed that every night as they approach, all the neighborhood dogs go crazy. Now that I''ve seen them and know what to look for, I see and hear their presence all the time. This is definitely a hot bed. I just don''t have the technology to show u definitive proof.",

    "After i arrived my dad and i went to the pond where he seen it and noticed some weeds were pushed over in this one section. we didnt disturb it in hopes of looking at it in the daylight. We also saw what we think could have been a heel impression but again we were waiting for daylight to get a closer look. When i was on the phone with him i talked him in to going over to the pond which wasn''t easy since he was very scared at the time. he didn''t have any shoes on but he told me that the ground was warm where he had seen him. he could literally feel the difference in temperature in his feet. We looked for tracks but the ground is very hard and had no luck in the dark. He kept trying to vocalize what he had heard and when he did i kept trying to remember where i had heard that before. After he kept saying that he had never heard anything like it before in his life i told him that i wanted him to listen to something on the computer. I played him several bigfoot audio sounds from the west coast and he kept saying it was to high pitched. I then played the ohio clip fron 1994 and immediately he said that that is what he heard except louder. As soon as he said that he made me stop the clip because it was freaking him out again.",

    " It was 2:35 in the morning on July 26, 2006. I recieved a call from my dad which alone is very unusual to say the least. He started by saying \"you are not going to  believe  what i just saw\". He said he steped out onto his porch(which  wraps around his house) to sit in his chair and have a smoke. He got about half way through with it when he said he heard the most terrifying sound ever. He  stepped in the door and grabbed a MAG light to take a look and when he did he saw a sillouette of a bipedal creature approx 8 foot tall and 75 yards away stand up near the pond and quickly run towards the neibors house which is to the right and behind him. At this point my dad is completely freaked out. He hears the loud moan again 3 more times each time getting softer in the distance. He then wakes my mother (who thinks he just lost his marbles) and she comes outside with him. She also hears the moan and a gun shot approx the same distance away but at this point it is an estimatted 1 mile away. This is when  he calls me and describes what happened. I get in my truck and go overe to their house to take a look around with him. Whatever it was is long gone by the time i get there and we just look  around to put both  my mom and dad somewhat at ease. The  reason i am writing this instead of my dad is 1) he dont t know how to use a computer and 2) i felt a report needed to be  made and i doubt he would ever do it. I can  tell you that i have never seen or heard my dad so scared in my life.",

    " I think I might have seen a big foot on May 30, 2012.  I went outside to put my trash can at the street at about midnight. The only light was the porch lights on the house behind us.  When I walked around the corner of the house, I froze because I saw what looked like something standing at my neighbor''s fence. They have a fence that is fenced in on three sides, just not at the front of the house, and what I saw was standing at the back of the fence, I think on my side of the fence, but not sure. All I could see was the silhouette of a person/thing, but it stood 1 1/2 to 2 feet over the top of the fence. All I could see was the silhouette of the shoulders and head and hair sticking up over the fence. It had long hair and it was not really moving.  Only the hair would move. At first I thought it was a person who had stopped and stood still when it saw me.  Then I realized it was way too big to be a person.  I admittedly have bad eyesight though, even with glasses on at night. On top of that I am a logical person with a master''s degree, so I don''t rush to conclusions, especially fanciful ones.  So I told myself it was just the shadows and light playing tricks on me.  I figured that something was propped up against the fence and just looked like a head and shoulders in the dark and that maybe the hair was some spanish moss caught on whatever it was. But I still felt uneasy and ran inside as fast as I could.  The next day (today) I went outside and looked for whatever it was that might have looked like a head and shoulders. But there as nothing there.  No plants, no trees, nothing propped up against the fence, no spanish moss, just a fence.  We went back outside tonight to look again and see if there was anything casting a funky shadow.  While that corner of the yard is dark and lights barely shine there from the windows, there was definitely nothing taller than the fence and nothing that looked like a head and shoulders. I would estimate, given that the fence is about 6 feet tall, that it was at least 7 1/2 to 8 1/2 feet tall.  It was broad shouldered. And it had long hair or fur on it''s head.  I am not saying it was a bigfoot, because I could not see it well enough to say that for certain, but I don''t think it was a person. If it was a person it was a very large, very tall, very hairy person.  Also, when I came back inside, my dog (a lab/border collie mix who is about 90 lbs) started growling.  He kept growling until I let him out of his kennel and he immediately ran to my back door.  I let him outside and he shot off.  Our yard is fenced in so he cannot leave the yard.  But ten minutes later when I went to let him back in, he wasn''t near the back door. It took several minutes for him to come back to the door after I called repeatedly.  That is not like him.  He usually is begging to come back inside and doesn''t hesitate when I call him.  After that he was very restless all night.  ",

    " This happened tonight.<BR><BR>I had gone outside on the porch to have a cigarette about 9:00 pm and my two German Sherpards went out with me. I was outside about 2 -3 mins. when less then 100 feet from me just at the woods edge I heard a very loud yell/scream.<BR><BR>My two dogs immediately jumped off the porch and took off towards the sound and I ran inside to get a shotgun and light.<BR> The dogs where running around sniffing the ground frantically but staying in the yard and not going into the wood. With my flashlight in one hand and gun in the other I went out into the yard and was looking around for a clue as to what could have made such a weird loud noise.<BR><BR>Even though we live in the country we do have a few houses around us and the only thing that I could come up with is that it had to be some kid messing around and at that time I became mad and yelled \" you might think messing around here playing games is fun but I''ll tell you I have a gun and someone could very well get hurt messing around like this in the dark\". I had barely gotten the words out of my mouth when I would say about 25 yards into the woods came the scream again. <BR><BR>The dogs dashed into the woods and even though they normally obey me very well, all of the yelling would not get them to return to the yard for about 5 mins. <BR><BR>Two things stand out as very odd about what happened tonight. One is that it was right in my yard, granted it was at the edge but it was in the yard none the less. It made such a loud yell as though it wanted me to know that it was there! The other thing I find strange is that the dogs never once barked or growled. You would have to know my dogs to understand how strange that is. They are very protective of the yard. They will bark at a leaf blowing though, and if anyone comes up the drive, watch out! They love to hear themselves bark. They did not bark once, they just kept running around as though they had gone nuts. My wife was in the living room and heard it.  It was loud enough to hear it with the windows closed and the TV on. <BR><BR>I am 45 years old, have hunted and camped a good part of my life, spending a lot of hours outdoors and I have never heard anything even close to what I heard tonight.<BR> ",

    " A friend and I were fishing for catfish in a creek at night (unsure of the time). One of us had brought along a flashlight and a pellet gun for snakes (the flashlight later ran out of power). We had been fishing for a little while, even after the flashlight had died, by watching the tips of our rods for movement. We were talking about something, when my friend Daniel heard something, and asked me \"Did you hear that?\" I said, \"Hear what?\" (I thought he was joking & trying to scare me) He responded, \"Listen, there it is again\". At that moment we were both quiet for about 3 to 5 seconds. I then heard something moving off towards the northwest (I would guess about 100 feet). We couldn''t see anything because of the density of the woods around us. Initially I thought that it was problably a cousin that had walked back to where we were, but realistically I was attempting to rationalize the situation. It was walking towards us, slowly, but fast enough that it made no break in the sound produced as it walked through the leaves. I said,\"Hey, who''s there? (at a moderate level of voice because we had been whispering before) As soon as I spoke, the thing stopped (you could hear it stop walking as it reacted to my voice). I then thought, maybe it''s an armadillo, just as my friend asked, \"What the hell is that?\" I responded, \"I don''t know!\" Before I was through saying the word \"know\", this thing bolted towards us, and it sounded like it was running as fast as an average man could run through the woods. We both freaked out and screamed as this thing ran towards us, now realizing that this wasn''t an armadillo. When this thing got about 20 feet from us, a surprising thing happened; the things split (there were two of them). One ran past me towards the southeast, and the other one ran off towards the southwest (you couldn''t see crap, but you could tell that they were big and massive by the sounds they made when they hit the water, splashing as they ran, hearing them leave the water and then breaking fallen tree limbs and stuff as they continued running [deer don''t do this]. We both stood there in fear and disbelief, listening to them until they were about 150 yards away, before we ourselves started running in the opposite direction. With no bears in the area (especially ones that are bipedal), there was only one explanation for what was out there with us that night.",

    " I was hiking by myself on the Florida Trail near Florahome. I walked south from the Trailhead near Coral Farms about 7:00. It had rained the day before amd the red clay/sand jeep road had no animal or human prints. All washed away. I reached a picnic table about 3 miles from the trailhead and went down a sidetrail for 15 minutes and then back to the picnic table. I started heading back the way I had come and within 200 yards of the table were some bare foot prints that appeared human. I thought that that was very strange as I had seen nor heard any people around at all plus I was wondering why someone was walking around barefoot. That''s when I noticed the prints were huge. At least 18 inches. I had a camera in my pocket, but, I was too freaked to stop and get it out. I tried to appear normal as I walked away quickly. I had the feeling that it knew I was there and was watching me as I glanced apprehensively in the direction it had walked off the trail. It gave a yelp, half dog/half human (acknowleging that I had seen his prints and knew he was there) and then I felt it was gone. I hurried back to my truck with no further incident.<BR><BR>My two sons saw Big Foot at Buck Lake, Ocala National Forest, a couple years earlier. ",

    " Right on the northwest corner of New World Ave. and Normandy Blvd. FSCJ owns approx. 135 acres. When things are slow I take our electric golf cart thru the woods just to look around and maybe spot wildlife as I go. Between the college and the city pool which is west of the college are numerous ponds, wetlands, and pine tree flats on forestry land. There are also alot of training areas left over from the Navy days and a few old roads that are similiar to power line right aways running mostly north and south.<BR><BR>Now to the day in question: We were allowing a contractor to drive thru our property to gain access to the forestry land and I went to talk to them to get an update on the project. It turned out they were not working that day so I was riding around just looking for wildlife. I came up to one of the old roads and when I looked north on the road there was something in the road sitting on it''s hunches and it appeared to have one arm in the air and the other was scratching it''s side. I was traveling kind of fast and could not stop until I was about 10 feet past the road. I put the cart in reverse to back up and it was not in the road any longer. I looked just past the spot where it was in the road and it was on the side of the road and was bending down a limb from a 4 or 5 foot pine tree peering out at me. This lasted for maybe 3 or 4 seconds and it ran in from what I could tell was an upright position. The small pines hindered my view when it was running but I am fairly positive it was running up right. What ever it was, was about 2 maybe 3 foot tall judging by the trees and was very black and resembled a primate. I worked at the Jax Zoo in maintenance for a few years and one of the exhibits I was responsible for was the Great Apes so I am very familiar with several different primates and it reminded me very much of a bonobo.<BR><BR>I was fairly shaken up and I did not go look for tracks, signs, or anything. Now to present, a few weeks ago forestry had a timber company thinning the pines in the same area, I went back there to talk to the job foreman as they were using our property to gain access. They were two or three hundred yards back in the woods and I did not want to drive my cart back there because of the road. I got maybe thirty yards off the road down the skidder trail and I am not sure what it was but the hair on my neck stood straight. I had a strong sense something was out there watching me. It may have been my imagination but I really believe I was being watched. <BR><BR>",

I turned on the back porch light as I walked out.  I took about two or three steps out onto the balcony and I heard a loud screaching yell and then three woo whoo whoo noises. As I live and breathe that WAS the sound of a primate!! Immediately the dog in a fence of a neighbor''s house right behind the apartment began barking like crazy for about 30 seconds and then stopped. It kind of freaked me out I thought, did an ape escape from Jax zoo or something? I crouched down a little on the balcony and watched the area. In about 5 min I could see the tree in the very back of the apartment back yard rustle a little and it was as if something was moving toward the fence. Then I heard two low grunts from the ground from inside the fence on the neighbors side. It is a privacy fence so I couldn''t see what made the grunt. The way the fences are all I could hear were like footsteps moving along the fence toward the trees I saw one shadow really dark moving along the fenceline...it wasn''t a person because the shoulders were way too wide and bulky and it wasn''t even fully upright. It kind of lumbered along like an ape....people just don''t move like that.",

    " At the time, I lived in Umatilla, Florida.I used to work on CB radios and such and occasinally a deputy would stop by my little shop at my house and we would shoot the bull. One nite a deputy stopped and said they had a Bigfoot sighting in the Ocala National forest, and being the curious type, I asked where and he told me. The next morning 6/30/1980, I got a friend of mine and decided to go and see if we could find the prints. We stopped at the hardware store and I bought, some plaster of paris. Already had the buckets in the Jeep. When we arrived we could see where casts had previously been taken, we decided to look further. So, we drove further thru the woods and had to cross a pretty deep creek to get to the other side, where the road continued, if you want to call it a road. I stopped the jeep and we got out to look around and LOW AND BEHOLD, there were prints coming from a clear cut area (where trees have been cut down and removed), across the sandy road and leading into the swamp. It had stopped at the edge of the road and must have eaten bay tree blossoms because up about 10 to 12 feet in the tree you could see where it took the blossoms and there were pieces of the blossoms on the ground. The prints were about 4 to 5 feet apart when it walked, and about 1 to 2 inches deep. As I walked or tried to walk in its stride, it was a stretch for me as I''m a pretty big man myself, 6ft.3in. I actually put my foot in its prints as i walked deeper into the swamp. The further I got the deeper the prints went into the ground and my foot and leg went all the way to my groin area, this thing was BIG. I took 2 casts and gave one to my buddy and I kept one, which I still have.There is NO DOUBT IN MY MIND after seeing what I saw and casting the prints that this DOES EXIST.",

    "As I was listening to the sound recordings on the BFRO website, I came across one clip that immediately made me flash back to another experience that I had shortly after we moved into this house. Sometime around the month of February 2008, I went out onto our screened in pool/patio area to feed our cats at 5:00 a.m. Because of the lights in the house and a light on the porch, the screen seemed opaque, so I couldnt see out. I heard a very loud noise coming from the backyard of our next door neighbors that startled me. I quickly dismissed it as the sound of a sprinkler hitting our aluminum fence. It was a metallic, chatter sound. It lasted about the duration of what might be the rotation of about 180 degrees of a sprinkler head. But then the sound abruptly stopped, and I could tell that neither our sprinklers nor our neighbors where on at the time. Several seconds later, I heard the same chilling noise but I could tell that the source was now about 200 feet away. I immediately felt frightened and went quickly back inside the house. It really spooked me at the time, but I hadnt thought about the incident again until I heard a similar recording on your website, specifically the 1973 Whoop-Howl from Puyallop, Washington. The sounds on that recording have that same high-pitched, metallic sound that I still recall from that morning. The sound of the bobcat from the National Geographic sight also sounded somewhat metallic-like, so that may be another possible explanation.",

    " On Monday, June 30, 2008, between 5:00 a.m. and 5:15 a.m., I had the experience of hearing a chilling and unexplained sound.  I was taking numerous boxes and garbage bags from the garage to the end of my driveway at the street for trash pickup.  I had made approximately 6 trips back and forth when, after laying a box down at the curb, I heard something that made me stop in my tracks.  I experienced what I first thought was the start of a loud siren, a loud and ascending WHOOOOO, coming from across the street.  The sound came from a tree line about 200 feet away at the edge of Horseshoe Lake.  There are empty grated lots directly across the street from my house (about 125 feet deep) and then approximately another 25 feet or more of dense palmetto scrub and primarily pines and loblolly bay trees down to the lake shore.  The sound continued to ascend in pitch and when the pitch didnt change like that of a siren and I realized that a siren would not be coming from that direction, but rather from the highway behind our house, I felt somewhat panicked.  The sound ended in a booming OOP.  The entire whoop was long in duration and went from a low to high pitch.  It seemed to be aimed directly towards me and was extremely far carrying in tone.  I immediately felt the hair on the back of my neck stand up.  When my brain could not place the sound with any animal or bird that I am familiar with, I became very frightened at thinking that a man was watching me and calling out.  I started to take some steps backward towards the garage in anticipation that I would see something moving towards me across the empty lot.  Within seconds of the WHOOP, an owl called out with a common hooting from the top of a tree in that same area, as if it had been startled.  The owls voice was very distinct from the other sound in the loudness and the way it carried, as well as the elevation of the source of the sound.  I went back into the garage and waited for about 5 minutes there to listen for any other sounds, but only heard the frogs that are common at that time.  Although still dark, there were clear skies at the time, and I could see the silhouette of the tree line.  My side of the street was dimly lit by the lights in the garage and street lights a short distance away.  I go out at this time every morning to haul trash and to take my dog for a quick walk out to the mailbox, and I am used to hearing numerous types of frogs, owls, and whippoorwills. As I stood there, logic told me that even a large man could not have made the resonating sound that I heard from that distance away.<BR><BR>Over the next few days, I told my family members what I had heard and asked if they knew of an animal or bird that made such a sound, but they didnt.  The sound I heard was so unusual, that I couldnt dismiss it.  I felt the need to keep trying to satisfy the mystery of the sound by placing a native bird or animal to it.  I read every voice description of Florida bird species entries in my North American bird book, paying closed attention to all owls, loons, cranes, egrets, herons and hawks, that I thought may be large enough to have such a bellowing voice.  None of the voices were described as whoops.  I then went online and searched for bird sound whoop and animal sound whoop.  I spent quite a bit of time on National Geographics website listening to voice recordings of numerous birds from this area as well as bobcats, coyotes, foxes, etc.  Nothing seemed to match.  I then started to notice the many links to the BFRO website as well as a link to a video of our local Channel 13 newscast of an expedition that BFRO had in the Tampa area about a year ago.  When I played the news clip, and heard one of the female researchers make a call out like a whoop, I almost felt relieved, like I knew in my heart that I was on the right track.  The sound I heard was very similar to the call she made, although the whoop I heard was of a longer duration.  After seeing the news clip, I felt more comfortable about researching the information on the BRFO website.  I came across the sound recordings, and after listening to several, I became convinced that what I heard matched more closely to some of the Skunk Ape recordings than to any other animal or bird known in this area.  I decided to call your organization to discuss what I had experienced.<BR><BR>Below are the most similar recordings I found on the website as compared to the sound that I heard:<BR><BR>1974 Whoops and Knocks from California (although I heard only one whoop and it was of longer duration)<BR><BR>The Florida Howl and the 1994 Moaning Howl from Columbiana County, Ohio (the howls in this clip start off like the siren-like beginning of the whoop I heard, but these then descend in pitch as opposed to the one I heard which continued to ascend until ending in a OOP)<BR>",

    "The sound came from a tree line surrounding the lake. Approximately 25 to 50 feet of shoreline on this side of the lake is labeled conservation area. This shore area connects to numerous acres of conservation property throughout the subdivision. The conservation areas are dense forests, made up of palmetto scrub, pines, loblolly bays, Florida maples, and oaks. Many of the areas are low-lying and swamp-like as is obvious by the numerous cattails. There are also numerous retention ponds through the area.",

    " My husband and I are from California and new to Florida. We wanted to explore some Florida forest land. We happened upon the Rock Springs Run State Reserve. We drove onto a dirt road, and parked off to the side. We got out and just started walking around. Right away, we saw a lot of vultures and groups of white tail deer. The area was buzzing with wildlife and sounds we didnt recognize. <BR><BR>We wanted to walk deeper into the trees, which would take us down to a lower terrain, but even with our hiking clothes and shoes, it turned out to be too much for us. Were very healthy and active, but it didnt seem like a fun idea. There were just too many wet, swampy areas of ground, and it turned out to be almost impossible, and we werent sure if we wanted to be struggling through alligator territory. <BR><BR>We made our way back up to a dirt path, and thats when we started hearing the banging sound. At first we thought it was a person out there doing something. But then the same sound started coming from another direction, maybe a quarter mile from the first one. It sounded like a they were hitting trees with a baseball bat, or a big piece of wood. It continued to go back and forth from one spot to another. It was one of those things that didnt seem weird at first, until you stop to think about it. No animals do that, and why would people go way out there and begin hitting trees in the swamp, and then take turns doing it? We just couldnt fathom what the purpose would be. We listened then walked back to the car and left. ",

    " Back in 1985-86 my family relocated to Coral Springs from Miami before the Sawgrass Express way was built. We lived so close to the Glades my friends and I used to ride our skateboards to the levy and watch the Everglades burn (at that time, some firebug had set quite a blaze). On some mornings we''d wake to cars and yards covered in ash. Needless to say, a lot of wildlife began to migrate closer to our neighborhood i.e.,deer,alligators, whatever. One night we pitched a tent in my friends back yard approx.  50 yrds from a canal that separated us from an apartment complex and across from that was the beginning of the everglades. The fires had been raging for weeks and people in the area were reporting missing pets, some of which were inside 6 foot privacy fences. <BR><BR>We used to run between houses to cut through to go home. This night in particular, before we called it quits, we played a bit of hide and seek. I remeber hiding under a window box behind a bush and got spotted by an unmarked police car. We really thought we were in trouble, but the police were looking for a person that had been peeping in windows. We assured the police we weren''t the perps and went on about our business and went to the tent. 3 kids in a tent don''t sleep well, so we were having fun cracking jokes and noticed a sound coming from across the canal approx 100 yrds away. Something was slamming the dumpster lids in the complex across the way and making low deep sounds, grunts. These were tall dumpsters. You''d have to get a boost to lift the lid. We got real quiet trying to listen to figure what it could be. At first we figured a cow got loose and possibly was bumping into the dumpster. But, it became evident that wasn''t so. One of the kids I was with turned on a flashlight and started making shadow puppets with his E.T. stuffed animal. Then the thing from across the canal took notice of us for the first time. The grunts were still audible but with what I would say is with a hint of curiosity. We got quiet and real concerned putting 2 and 2 together. Could this be what the police were looking for? The steps grew closer and closer. I remember we tried to figure if it was a quadraped or biped. When the steps finally stopped, the breathing grew louder, then SPLASH!!! Whatever it was was 50 yrds from us and coming right in our direction. We sprinted for the house waking up my friend''s family. They were woken by 3 screaming kids at 2a.m. exclaiming something is out there. His dad grabbed his shotgun, turned on the flood lights.  He went out to look around and found the tent was demolished and covered in water. I swear I could feel this thing  right around the corner in the shadows looking right at us. We did not let his father investigate further until morning and couldn''t beleive the tent had been moved from its postion. I have no doubt had we stayed in that tent this story would be much different, if at all. I am 35 now and have never forgotten that night. ",

    " Today me, my mother and my son were coming back from a doctors appointment for my son. We were driving along a road that we have been many times. It''s a nice little stretch of road with a great view. The land is beautiful with lots of natural Florida woods with swamp areas. There are also many orange groves in this area. It''s not uncommon to see turkeys, hogs and occasional deer. The pasture land has cows on it from time to time. When this sighting happened there were no cows around. <BR><BR>It was about 12:15 pm. The weather was over cast and it was going to rain at any minute. No other cars around. We passed one after the sighting down the road when we turned around to go back. We have had a ton of rain in this area lately.<BR><BR>As we were traveling down the road we came up on this swampy area in a very large oak hammock. My 17 yr old son was the first to ask if me and my mother saw that? My 72 year old mother said yes but what was it? I said I saw it too...we keep driving for about 2 minutes we said nothing then my mother said turn around and go back. We all saw something and we need to go back and look. So I turned around and went back. But it was not there as far as we could see. We pulled up to the area and just sat there. All of us trying to figure out what we saw.<BR><BR>We all saw a human like figure standing out in the middle of the marshy swampy area up to it''s waist in water. The figured appeared to be a dull brown color. It was wide across the shoulders with hair and looked like moss hanging from it. It was standing up with it''s long limbs away from it''s body. The head was kinda down. The shape of the head was different. My oldest son described the head as different from a human. We are not sure what exactly it was doing. In the past we have seen cows out in this marshy swampy area. My Mother was trying to justify what she saw hating to admit that it was beyond strange. But she did admit at how very strange it was. <BR><BR>I turned the truck around and we headed home. We talked about it a little more and then just let it die. We had a very stressful morning after coming from an appointment to see if my son had cancer. He did not and we were all so dazed seeing that was over kill. Very emotional day.<BR><BR>",

    " I have just happened upon your web site and I am amazed at all the encounters in Florida.  I just finished reading one from the Lee County area that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.  I grew up in Lee County and had two unexplainable (until now) experiences that I have never forgotten.<BR><BR>The first, that after reading one of your articles, I now feel very strongly that I was being followed by a \"Bigfoot.\"  I lived on about 100 acres that butted up to Cecil Webb (a Game Reserve of apprx. 15,000 acres, in Charlotte County, FL.) A friend and I were taking a nighttime horseback ride down the dirt road that I lived off of.  There where large ditches on both sides of the road, with woods and cattle pastures, all up and down this road, which was probably about 10 miles long. She and I were talking about what 15 year old girls talk about, when our horses started acting spooked and getting very nervous.  Shortly thereafter, I noticed that something was walking along side of us in the woods on the other side of the ditch.  I could only hear it because there was not quite half a moon and it was a cloudy night.  I knew that there was a cattle pasture there and at first dismissed it as maybe being a cow, which would have odd seeings that cattle usually run in the other direction when seeing a person on horseback, but it was possible.  But the pattern in which it moved didn''t sound like a cow, the area was pretty thick with trees, palmettos and such and whatever it was had no problem staying right with us and we were on open land.  We weren''t really scared yet, but we picked up our horse''s pace a little and began to gallop, I knew there was a cross section coming up in the fence and figured whatever it was would be stopped there.  My girlfriend and I had our horses in a pretty good gallop at this point, but we were extermely shaken after passing the cross-section of fence and it was still there.  It seemed as though it never missed a stride.  At this point we both let out screams and were now at a full run, crossing several more fence lines, only to have it stay right with us.  It only stopped when we reached the edge of my property and it was no longer wooded.  By the time my parents calmed down two screaming, crying, freaked out teenage girls, we went out in the truck and saw where something had been, but never saw what it was.  Needless to say, that was the last time I''ve ever been nighttime horseback riding.     <BR> ",

    " I will tell you about an experience that I and a friend of mine had back around 1982 or 1983 mid summer time in Lee County, Florida. <BR><BR>I have lived in Florida since I was 9 years old. I am 44 now. I have roamed all over the woods down here and so has my friend Bill. We are both well acquainted with the noises that the native animals make, what we heard that night while camping was not anything that either of us had ever heard before. I am not in a hurry to ever hear again. <BR><BR>The location of the vocalization was approximatley 15 to 20 miles from I-75 going east on SR 82. I lived off of Shawnee trail back then and hiked the cypress swamps every chance I got. I knew the area well back then having hunted deer and hog all over that area.<BR>I still live in unincorporated Lee county near the Hendry county line.<BR><BR>Bill and I had gone camping on a weekend during the wet season. We had to wade quite a bit of wet area to find a suitable dry place to set up camp. I lived about 1 and 1/2 miles off of S.R.82 and where we were camping then was probably another 3 or 4 miles back in the swamp. We had just gotten a fire going and it was quite dark by now. We were sitting by the fire when we both heard a deep scream coming from out of the swamps. It was like no sound I have ever heard. It was deep and drawn out and echoed back through the swamps. I am not exagerating when I tell you that even the bugs got quiet. Bill looked at me and said, \"What the hell was that?\"  I said \"I dont know but I''m going home.\"  We broke camp and left. <BR><BR>Neither of us was carrying a weapon during that trip. I dont think I would have shot what ever it was that made that noise, but I don''t ever go to the woods now without a gun. I can also provide you with Bill''s contact info so you can ask him about it. <BR><BR>We did not see anything nor smell anything just heard the one scream. I would estimate the creature was within 1 mile or less of us.  I have told my parents about this. They said it may have been a gator or panther but I know what those animals sound like. It was neither of those animals.  I know several other people that have had experiences with the skunk ape. I am not sure if they will be willing to talk about their experiences or not. <BR>",

    " I have a sighting and other occurences to report. Its been about 3 years now since my friend Dan and I saw it. We were walking along a dirt/road trail along the focka canal system to find a good bass spot, as we were walking I thought I saw large brownish colored legs ahead on the trail. I didnt say anything at first until Dan asked me if I saw that. I was stunned and replied \"Yea, Huge brown legs cross in front of us and he replied \" I thought it was just my eyes\". The sasquatch was in a group of trees next to the canal I guess checking us out. The reason I am saying this is because we heard and saw the branches in front of us russling. We were honestly scared and backed away slowly. Now Dan is a officer in the Navy now working I believe out of Miami. He is a very credible none bs type of person. I myself is a biologist and I am super observent of my surroundings. The only reason why we just saw the legs is because we were looking down in front of us so we didnt step on one of the resident water moccasins. Since then I have been going to the same location to try to see if \"its\" still there and yes \"it\" is. I havent seen it since the first time but I found an area off the trail that had almost like I guess beds?!? Basically it was long saw grass bundled up together and it was obvious something large has sat in it. Also near by I found skelatal remains and hair from a bear that seemed to literally have been ripped in half. I have also spent many nights fishing in the location and near it and have heard undeniable ''calls\" that seem like it came from some sort of primate. Similar to a very deep howler monkey call.  I have a lot of experience with primates from my studies throughout Latin America. Based on that I KNOW it was a primate call. There was another occurence when I was with my friend Chris on Turner River Rd. off Rt.41 South of Ochopee,Fl. We were crawfish hunting after a evening shower and heard some odd noises in the woods across the canal system. Then we smelt a very odd odor I wouldnt say it smelt like rotten eggs like all the other reports but maybe like methane gas. We moved on about 2 miles down the road and was picking more crawfish out of the swamp and heard the same noises followed by the same smell. This occured for another 30 minutes or so and we felt uncomfortable and left. <BR>I believe I read that the BFRO went to Florida in 08 on an investigation and I believe it was off Rt.41? I think there is a few key locations that BFRO should check out, 1. Picayune Strand, just outside of Naples, Fl, http://www.fl-dof.com/state_forests/picayune_strand.html, 2. Turner River and Birdon Rds. just south of Ochopee, Fl off Rt. 41 http://www.staynplay.net/florida-tourism-articles/turner-river-road.htm<BR>I live in New Jersey but have a condo in Naples,Fl, if BFRO wants to investigate these areas I believe I can find time to come down and show you the exact spots of the occurences. If you have any further questions please contact me I will be more then happy to answer any questions BFRO may have. Please take this seriously, my stories are not bogus, bs statements. I will take a polygraph test if need be. Please contact me back with your thoughts.",

    " I''ve thought about posting my experience here for awhile, but since I was so young, I have faded memories of the event.  Therefore, I wasn''t sure it would be so useful.  However, after looking at the BFRO data base for the area, I couldn''t help notice the similarities in occurrences, specifically BFRO report 1283.  Also, report 15170 was in the exact same area.<BR><BR>I emailed my mother and father about the event a year ago, and I''ll edit to protect the names/paraphrase what they had to say about it.<BR><BR>In an email, I asked my dad if he remembered the night, remembered throwing a rock in the woods at what we heard, and what exactly happened, here''s his response:<BR><BR>\"I remember that night very, horribly, well...  We had been camping at the very Southern tip of Everglades National Park.  If the same camping area still exists, I think it''s now called the \"Flamingo Campground.\"  Nice name.  If you don''t quite recall, here''s the link - http://www.nps.gov/archive/ever/visit/camping.htm<BR><BR>Anyway, we set up our campsite, and I believe it was on the first night that we chose to do some night-fishing along one of the zillion canals in ENP.  We had the little orange ''73 Honda Civic parked on the side of a canal.  As you recall, we heard the leaves rustling s-l-o-w-l-y as something or someone moved back and forth.  Although I don''t remember it, I probably did throw a \"rock\", aka \"rock sponge\", aka, a piece of uselessly light coral.  Nothing happened, so I shone our huge, massive, bright flashlight with a big 6V batttery right at the source of the sounds.  Of course, the vegetation was too thick for decent light penetration, but NOTHING was revealed.  And, most chilling of all, what/whoever it was, pacing back and forth, continued to pace back and forth in a most non-wild-animal way.  I/we shouted, to no avail, and I got a series of impressive chills down my spine. I said, \"Let''s get in the car!\" and we took off down the little side road while Mom said, \"Do you think it was the Skunk Ape?\".  I was carrying our surf-casting rod with my hand along the roof of the Civic, and was really, really glad to be out of there.\"<BR><BR>I then emailed him back and asked him if he smelled anything:<BR><BR>\"No, I don''t remember any smell.  In the cold light of dawn, I thought that it was probably just an armadillo or some other exceptionally stupid animal that didn''t know how to be afraid of light at night.  It didn''t even stop moving, let alone run away, when I turned on the flashlight and swept it around the area the sounds were coming from.  I remember being so afraid that I didn''t think there was time to break down the surf-casting rod, so that''s why I carried it with my hand, gripping the roof of the car with the rod against it.  It was the most scared I''ve been in my adult life.\"<BR><BR>Here is my mom''s response to my original email:<BR><BR>\"I remember  that  I was sooo scared I didn''t even open the car door I shoved you thru the window and you piled in on top of a bunch camping gear,  cooler ect... Dad had to drive backwards  too. I have to say it was one of the most scariest things that has happened to me.\"<BR><BR>Personally, I remember mostly being terrified as a child, because my parents were.  My dad in particular, is not one to scare easily.  On top of that, he is a lifelong scientist who views all ''strange nature'' occurrences with a very stern skeptical eye.  So as an adult, to think back on his fear, and have him admit how scared he was, means that something instinctual kicked and told him to haul butt out of there.  If he thought it was a person, he would have confronted them immediately. I''ve seen him do exactly that on many occasions.<BR><BR>I wish I had been a bit older when this happened, but I figure any bit of detail can help the larger cause.",

    "  Immokalee,Florida 1987 - My family and I were in having an evening of fun when we heard a horrible noise coming from the direction of where our dog was outside. My husband went out to investigate because our dog sounded as if were scarred or being hurt. When my husband got to our shed he saw a large shadow up against the siding and it sounded as if our dog were being muffled. He ran back into our home thinking it was a bear or something to the effect and grabbed his gun. He then went back outside ( us trailing close behind him) and it appeared to him as if something were running down our driveway - in the meantime our dog was hidding underneath our home. My husband fired a couple of shots towards the area he thought this creature or animal was and we heard a very loud growl howl type noise, after that it got deathly quiet. <BR><BR>I will never forget the chills that ran up me when I heard theses sounds.The next morning we did check the area and we did find weird type footprints that looked not like human nor were they a bear or any other type of animal that I am familar with. Whatever it was it was able to make a leap from the street and across a canal and land on it''s feet. The only thing that we can figure is that during the day we had taken our family fishing in the grove and we were followed back by what I honestly believe to be a bigfoot. <BR><BR>Our home sat on a hill that when our porch light is on it can be seen from within the surrounding woods - we checked this - I believe it followed the lighting as it knew there was something there. We later found out that the people who occupied our home before us had an encounter with the backdoor being ripped off it''s hinges. They assumed it was a burglary while away. We now suspect not. We were told also through my husbands supervisor that several sightings had occured not only in the area but at Lake trafford as well. Lake Trafford was less than 5 miles from where we were living at the time. I will never forget my experience with this night. I thank God my chldren were sleeping but unfortunately my younger brother was not - he was 10 at the time and I remember him being so very frightened and crying. He still remembers that night. <BR><BR>Every since I have wanted to find proof of what we heard and to prove to myself that it was real. I am a believer!",

As we were passing East at Long Creek I looked to the left and saw what looked like a pile of dark Spanish moss looking grass. I thought to myself that it was odd to see a large pile of soggy grass and moss that was oddly shaped so symmetrically. Then I saw that it was a creature standing  trying not to be seen and as still as can be. I couldnt speak, I couldnt process what I was seeing and then the words left my mouth... Honey I said to my husband, I just saw a Sasquatch by the side of the road crouching down. He could tell by the look on my face that I had, in fact, seen something. I still cant believe it, Im chuckling nervously talking about it... unbelievable. <BR>It was a dark mound of crouched flesh and soggy hair. I could not see its face just the pointed head and massive shoulders. The fence is 4.5 tall and it was another 3 higher and just as wide.

    " It was the summer of 1993, and I was five years old. I know my age at the time seems discouraging, but I know what I saw, and I can recap the whole thing like it had happened yesterday. It was a late evening and my family and I were playing around in the living room of our single wide. I went down the hallway to the back bedroom. That was my bedroom at the time and my brother and I kept our toys in there. We had one smaller window and beneath that is where we kept our toy chest, and in front of it was a chair. I went into the room, sat on my legs in the chair and opened the toy chest. I grabbed all kinds of legos, and after I had grabbed the last lego that I could have possibly held, I sat up straight and there in the window were two piercing red eyes. I just stared at them. My arms let go of the legos and they dropped back into the chest. I stared at those eyes for minute and than ran down the hallway. I had no idea what it could have been. I yelled over and over again that there was a wolf in my window. But my parents just assured me that it was probably the dog next door. <BR><BR>Okay, we lived in a mobile home meaning it was on blocks, and no dog, even on their hind legs could peek into the window. That window was set high off the ground. And it wasn''t like it was eyes looking from below. These eyes were in the middle of the window, so whatever it was had to have been tall enough to be able to look in. They were like human eyes but not quite. For years I tried to figure out what it might be. I thought maybe an owl..but they have yellow eyes, and there were no trees close enough for a bird or animal to perch on and be that close to the window. I mean, it was right up against the window. It still gives me goosebumps to this day. And this is the same exact story I have been telling since that night for years now. And I can''t get it out of my head.",

    " About 26 or 27 years ago when I was about 9 or 10 at the time and my sister was either 7 or 8, but we both remember exactly what we saw.  We shared a bedroom in the mobile home that we lived in.  The bedroom window was only about a foot wide and a foot tall and was only about one foot from the ceiling.  One summer night we both woke up with a feeling like something was watching us, and when we looked at the window we both saw a dark figure looking down at us through the window.  the thing that got us both was the red eyes that almost glowed in the dark.  We were so scared that neither of us moved a muscle until whatever it was left.  a couple of weeks later, my mother and I were sitting in the living room watching tv late at night when all of a sudden we both heard a loud bang and the mobile home shook.  the next day when we went outside to look, the middle of the back door had a fist print in it about half way up the door and it was bent in a little.  (it was a metal door.)  and there were big bare foot prints under the door.  the mobile home sat about three feet off the ground at that time, so the bedroom window alone had to be at least 8 feet from the ground. the last thing was in either December or January that winter, my sister and I were waiting at the bus stop to go to school, when we heard something in the palmetto bushes behind us.  We both turned around and saw a dark figure moving the palmetto bushes aside with it''s hand to look at us, then duck back down behind the bushes.  it did that for about 10 minutes or so until more kids started showing up at the bus stop, then we didn''t see it again.  Neither of us were brave enough at that time to go see what it was.",

    " Aug. 26 2011<BR><BR>This day was a Friday in August, Central Florida. In the pre-dawn hours of the morning my husband was not even half way on his commute from Space Coast to Disney World to report for his early morning shift, like he does 5 days a week.  He takes the 192 which involves a loooong stretch of road with seemingly no sign of life anywhere for about an hour until you reach the St. Cloud area.  My husband slammed on the brakes to try to avoid what was in the road without hitting it dead on, all the while trying to avoid flipping his Volkswagon Passat. Unfortunately, he could not avoid contact, and he struck the massive 9 Ft. Gator. He pulled the car over after attempting to resume driving, realizing the car was now undriveble. He made phone calls to the insurance company, his job, and me.<BR><BR>I head out on the same stretch of 192 to retrieve him.  His vehicle is being loaded onto a flatbed and he is waiting with the tow truck driver who is nice enough not to leave him standing at the side of the road in the middle of nowhere at (now) 6 o''clock in the morning.  <BR><BR>I am driving, wide awake, looking the whole time for this piece of road kill.  I want a photo of it. No I am not morbid, but he said it was HUGE, and I take pictures of all wild animals I come across. Bunnies, snakes, gators, whatever.  I drive a long time, the sun is breaking over the line at the moment I finally come to the Gator.   It is daylight enough that I can drive without headlights and I can see outside very well. I see it up ahead in the distance, I see the Turkey Vultures. The BIG BLACK birds that come to eat the road kill.  My eyes are darting down to the road, up ahead the highway looking for the tow truck, back to the monstrous mess in the road.  I am slowing down so I can photograph the Gator, and I am reaching for my camera.  As my eyes follow a 3-pack of the large birds up off the road and cross over the the right, I see a man walk into the woods up ahead. He is up ahead a distance I would call a block. A block away.  He is wearing ALL BLACK.  His elbows are bent as he is walking,  and he disappears into the woods. <BR>So I am pulling over now, snapping photos of the disgusting mound that is so large in the road that if it''s not cleaned up, and if someone hits that, there is going to be another accident. And I am fully awake and present in the moment.  I am running a checklist in my head.  Gator. Birds. Man. <BR><BR>Man ?!?!  What Man? Why would a \"man\" be out here at (now) 7am exactly, walking around in the woods. There are cows here.  Lots of land you pass on this road has cattle being  raised for beef. Oh, and a DEER sign. A sign, just a moment back I passed , warning of Deer Crossing. (Thanks for the heads up on the 9 Ft. Gators).  So he''s tending to his cows?  A ranch hand? Where''s his truck? Where''s his Cowboy hat? . So I recall this again.  A man - in ALL black- no change of color for face or hands- Wearing a black hoodie? On a beautiful, warm, dry, summer morning- in August- in Central Florida? He''s not  looking  when  a car pulls up? He  walks into the woods that are headed nowhere?  I don''t think so.  Makes no sense.  I think I saw a Bigfoot.  <BR><BR>So it took me about 2 minutes to put this all together and I didn''t want to leave!  I wanted to go in after him.  I couldn''t. My husband was waiting and was all revved up from his climactic morning.  He would be angry if I delayed, goofing off. The tow truck driver had waited long enough. I snapped like 2 pictures of the mess in the road and quickly moved on.  <BR><BR>Putting this all together in the months since the event, it makes more and more sense that what I saw was a Florida Skunk Ape.  Of course he would be pulled out of the woods at the knowing of the HUGE road kill.  It was dark for more than an hour while that Gator sat there in the dark. There was time for a Bigfoot to hoof it on out there and check out the scene, hey, he even had enough time to pack a bag lunch. Nearly escaping unnoticed before the sun came up over the horizon.  <BR><BR>It has been almost a year, and I am planning to go back to said location and search for prints and evidence one day. I have driven by the exact location approximately 6 times since then. Each time going over and over it in my head.  I am so angry with myself that I had camera in hand, and came up empty.  But even driving in the passenger side with the camera hanging out of the window I can miss a pic of a deer!  Nothing could have prepared me to photograph a \"hey--maybe that''s a \"somethin''  \" at a moment''s notice.  Meanwhile, since my incident I have heard of two other sightings in locations that are within 2 hours driving distance (east or south) of my incident.  I continue to search for new reports of local sightings and hope to make future trips to search for tracks. Camera in hand. ",

    " I grew up on a pretty good piece of property that was backed up to a pretty good amount of acreage of swampland. My brother, dad and I always went to the back pasture where we would play in the pond which connected to the swamp. we had a pretty good dry season one year an we went back to the pond to see how bad the water had gone down and noticed very large tracks of some sort, as we were approaching the pond first thought was one of the cows had walked through but as we got closer they were human foot tracks but abnormally very large tracks. My dad had a tape measure in the truck we drove to the pond we measured the tracks an they were approximately 29 to 30 inches in length. I''m not sure how big Bigfoot tracks usually are but I''ve never seen anyone with feet that big. My dad said that it was people tracks but I beg to differ. I''m not sure on how wide they were but my guess was that they were around 10 inches wide. I know when you get reports like this people exaggerate some and even a lot but I''m a 1000% sure on what i saw I''ve never seen anymore tracks after that, Since my brothers and I are in the woods a lot hunting and I''ve never seen anything like it. I''ve heard strange noises in the woods and in the swamp that I couldn''t explain or even could possibly mimic but who knows could be anything. <BR><BR>Also this wasn''t the only encounter that I''ve had, It was a couple years ago me and a buddy of mine always hog hunt in the woods on the back side of our neighborhood with his parents. We decided to go for a walk to a little slew we had found while hunting. We gotten about 100 to 160 yards into the tree line the moon was full so the woods came alive. As we got on to the game trail, I noticed something in the palmettos among the oak trees. I told him to stop and get down and be still that I think i see a big hog by the oak tree about 30 yards off the game trail 50 yards ahead of us. He spotted the figure by the tree and we began to watch it. The figure never moved so we stood up to keep moving. When we did it quickly stood up and quickly moved behind the tree we just froze and watched to see if whatever it was would come out of hiding. As we were watching the tree we heard something heavy footed walking around the pepper trees off to the side of us, my friend freaked out and took off running out of the tree line toward the houses. I had no choice to follow after him because I did not wanna stay to find out what it was by myself. As I turned to run I seen a tall figure through the pepper trees, I didn''t stop to see what it was but it was huge and wasn''t on all fours as I reached the fence. I heard a low gurgle sounding exhale come from the trees, my first thought was a bear but I have never seen or witnessed a bear in Florida. Of course they are here but I''ve never heard of anyone seeing a bear in the town i lived in, but it was bigger than any bear I''ve seen. I lived in Montana for a few months and have seen bears, monstrous black bear to be specific but i am 98% it was not a bear I''m not taking out the possibility that it was, but i couldn''t see it being one.",

We stood up and looked and listened, they immediately stopped.. we both whispered \"what was that\" to each other fearing a game warden or the owner of the land..then we heared a palm frond move and two distinct steps.We looked at eachother and ran three steps, stopped looked wide eyed, unsure of what we were hearing. then we heared a frond move and three steps and again it stopped. We turned, ran two and stoppped then we noticed it was immitating us, stopping when we did etc and comming closer. again we turned and took a step and it took a step and stopped. Me and tim looked at eachother and ran as fast as we could, we knew it was a game warden or a person, it had to be. we stopped after 200 yards or so and turned and looked there was nothing behind us but along the tree line we had left ( we were now 250yds across the swampy opening across from the tree line) about at 2 O clock position in the distance we coul hear something smashing its way through the undergrowth and breaking everything it touched heading away from us... we would always talk about it and I personally regret running, I had a strong light, I should havetried to get it closer, I think I could have, it was interested and following us. I know it was no animal, was easy to tell because you could hear it clear the path and then take distinct steps.. each step the exact count of our own. that is my story but I would like to add this.<BR>         Timmy has been dog hunting every nite for 5 or more years  and after this incedent he described a  swtrange encounter where he was with three other people who all saw the same thing... He stated that one nite while hog hunting during a half moon him and the guys were stopped and resting when tim noticed an outline at the bottom of a tree.. all the guys looked and they became concerned and frightned because<BR>there was the distinct outline of a huge man sitting at the base of that tree, plainly outlined sitting on his butt, feet streight out in front of it..Tim said it had huge shoulders and was just eanourmous..he said \" We freaked out and ran like hell\" funny thing is it was again private land and at first they thought it was a warden, but after a few mins they had no idea what it was but became extremely afraid of that massive torso sitting at the base of that tree watching them. ( I am beginning to notice there is almost always a tree involved in these sightings) I believe timmy, there is no person I know who has covered more ground in pitch black woods than him and we spent a few together doing it. Honestly it has haunted me since and led me here to study and make an effort of my own to discover this being. That is all I have, take care.<BR>        George",

    " It was a hot afternoon in august. I heard sirens in the distance. the local rescue squad was responding to an incident. curious about what was going on I decide to go and see.<BR><BR>when we arrived, I found out that 2 bham men had went canoeing and had not been seen since. the sherrif wanted to call for a helo to search the river. I piped up and told them that in was not a good idea. the trees cause a tunnel affect over the river. the helo wouldn''t be able to see under the growth. on top of that the sun was starting to go down. he agreed and sent 6 men in 2 canoes down the river. <BR><BR>30-45 minutes passed and we were told that they had been found at a local bar in b''ham. my friend and I volunteered to pull the rescuers out of the river at a mid point near the road. we set off. the light was almost gone. as we made our way down the trail to a place where the stream and the cahaba meet my friend took off ahead of me. he knew the area better and i could see his light moving ahead of me. as I entered the bottoms where a bamboo thicket grew, I heard brush breaking and grunting noises to my left. I quickley made my way across the stream. I felt much better and safer once I crossed the stream. <BR><BR>as I rejoined my friend at the intersection of the stream and river, I told him about what I had heard. he said it was probably a boar rooting for acorns. we sat for about an hour waiting. the moon was out quarter waxing, and hot as hell 100% humidity 90 degrees. <BR><BR>after waiting I said to my friend that we must have missed the rescue team in the night. so he went to find out and he left me there on the bank to make sure they were not just slow getting down the river. another 30 minutes went by and I started seeing a light up the bank approaching my position. I pulled myself up into the foliage to camo myself, just in case the light was moon shiners or pot growers. they are notorius for bibb county. minutes passed and I heard my name being called. I made my way back across the stream and through the thicket. the grunting and brush snapping sounds still happening. as I climbed up the hill to the large over hanging rock i paused to catch my breath holding onto the tree. all of the sudden something large much taller than myself( I am 6''8\"tall) rushed me. more of the limbs breaking and a vocalization sound like an excited baboon and a fierce growl. My friend was 10'' in front of me. we ran quickley away from it. i even jumped a 10'' ravine to get away. but it did not pursue further.   ",

    " I was canoeing on the Sipsey river in Alabama. It was dusk as I was pulling out of the river and I was trying to hurry to get all my gear in the car before it got dark as it was about a 60 yard walk up this steep hill to where my car was. Just as I was flipping the canoe up to put on my shoulders I heard this very loud \"WHOOOOP, WHOOOP, WHOOOP, WHOOOP\", then a pause then three more whoops. I ''ve been in the woods enough to know it was not an owl or like any sound I''ve EVER heard in the woods or on a river. Too loud, too powerful. It felt like it came frome about a quarter to a half mile away. It scared the piss out of me. You''ve never seen a guy hustle a 75 lbs canoe on their shoulders and practically run up the hill. I didn''t even tie it on properly until I got up to the highway. The weird part was I had been watching the Monster Quest series and the month before had come down the same river and thought \"This area looks just like that crap they show in the Pacific Northwest where those bogfoots are. Wonder if there were ever any bigfoots in Alabama?\" So I did an internet search and it surprised the crap out of me and found a whole freakin website about Alabama Bigfoots. Those sounds I heard sounded just like the whoops you have on this web site. Of course after watching those shows it could have been somebody doing that call blasting thing but I had emailed the Alabama Research people and they said they did not have anyone working that area at that time(AUG 2010). Over the last year I have had a few \"unusual\" moments in this area. No sightings but well, I''m short on time. The WHOOOPS were the important thing, scared the hell out of me.",

    " This happened in 1988 in Nauvoo AL.  I was 14 years old. I was at home in my living room watching TV and my brother was outside working on a car. We were the only ones at home.  The front door was located in the living room. We never used this door because we had no steps to it and the door was about 4 feet from the ground. So we used the back door of the house. I was sitting on the couch watching TV when the door began to move and the door knob was turning. The only thing holding the door shut was a nail someone had nailed at the top of the wall and bent it over to hold the door shut. I first thought it was my brother but he knew we didn''t use the door. As the door was moving just a little I noticed at the bottom of the door where there was a gap, 3 fingers slide under the door. My heart began to beat faster, I tried to move but I couldn''t at first. Then I wanted so bad to look out the window beside the door but I was too scared. These fingers were very long and the nails were long too and black. The hand like finger had hair on it dark brown. The hair was long. This only lasted for 3 min. When the fingers move out from the gap the door knob and the door stop moving. About 45 min. later my brother came inside and I asked him why he was trying to use the front door he said he hadn''t. I didn''t tell him what happened until sometime later. Because of fear he wouldn''t believe me and the fear of him using this to scare me later on.",

    " I had purchased a fence for my cats and my husband and I had spent most of the day putting it up .We stopped working on it that evening so we could have time to feed the animals-horses,dogs chickens and cats- before dark . By the time we were finished feeding everything it was dark but I had decided to run a cord with a light on it out to the fence and work on it a while longer adding more clips to it . The local high school is about 1 or 1 1/2 miles from our house and they were having a tractor pull that night and I could hear the noise from the tractors .Other than that, it was quiet out . The fence is out close to the barn which has a security light on it . With that light and the light on the cord that I had hanging from one of the tall fence post, the area where I was working was well lit . I had been working for about 2 hours when I heard a noise coming from the woods to my left about 100 or 150 yards away . There is a deer trail that runs through the woods there and the noise I heard sounded like something had caught a deer . I continued putting clips on the fence, not thinking anything else about the noise I had heard and about 25 or 30 minutes later at about 100 yards up from the place I had heard the first noise, I heard something make a loud hollering howling sound . Not wanting to believe what I heard, I told myself that it had to have been the neighbors dog . They have a huge dog that has a hoarse bark . Anyway, I decided it was time for me to go inside . I gathered up my tools and just as I was about to get on the four wheeler, I heard it holler,howl again . This time the sound came from the area where I had heard the first noise, that sounded like the deer had been caught . I didn''t take time to turn the four wheeler around . I backed it all the way back to the house, right up to the back door .I jumped off, ran in and locked the door .I was shaking so bad I could barely stand . It was like I was having a nightmare, I couldn''t believe what I had heard . I told my husband and we went back out with the gun but we didn''t hear anything . I knew what I had heard sounded like the sound the bigfoot made on the programs I had watched on TV and at first I even thought I was crazy for even thinking that that''s what it could have been and Iv''e tried my best to convince myself there''s no way it could have been a bigfoot but it hasn''t worked . My husband keeps saying that he believes I had heard something and that there''s a good explanation for it because there''s no such thing as a bigfoot . He hasn''t been able to give me a good one yet . I have called the local game warden and tried to mimic the sound  I had heard asking him if he knew of any animal in this area that would make this sound and he said no . He did say that the only thing he could think of might be some sort of canine - a coyote or if it was more of a high pitched sound it might be a fox . Please believe me this was no coyote, no fox, no small animal could make a sound like the one I heard . It was 100 or 150 yards away and it sounded like it was standing right behind me . I could tell that it was coming from something very large because of the power behind the sound and the sound it''s self was like a loud Ahoooooooo .There''s no way anyone could have been in the woods faking this . It was real . This experience has affected me big time . My doors are closed and locked  now day and night - I don''t think a locked door would stop it, but I lock them anyway . If I''m at home alone during the day and I need to go outside for anything, I carry a gun with me . Under no circumstances do I go outside at night now . I''m afraid to sleep at night . I''m scared to death here now . I don''t know for a fact that what I heard was a big foot but I believe with everything inside me that it was . When I found this sight on the internet and listened to the sounds that had been recorded, I swear to you, I started shaking all over again . It sounded exactly like what I had heard-  Exactly-  except what I heard was very close to  me. This is the bad part of it all - When I called the game warden to tell him what I had heard and ask if there was any animal here that could make this sound, he said some sort of canine maybe . I said \"No Sure, it wasn''t any kind of dog or coyote or fox or crane - ( which is what my husband said it could have been-but no it was no crane . I''ve heard cranes before and they do make a scary sound, but it wasn''t a crane.) or any kind of cat , I''ve never heard anything make a sound like I had heard in real life before. ) He then ask \" what did it sound like?\" I hesitated for a second or two  before  I said \" A Bigfoot \" He said back to me  \"well, like said it could be some sort of canine or something like that.\" When he said that, I started crying - I couldn''t help myself, I cried and told him that this was no joke that I was serious and that I was scared to death now . I believe he was thinking he had real nut case on the phone crying, telling him how scared she was cause she heard a BIGFOOT in the woods behind her house. I think he got a good laugh out of it anyway . Please believe me every word I''ve put down on this page is true . There is something in the woods behind my house that hollers, howls and I''m very scared of what it could be . I didn''t see what it was and I pray to God that I never do, I did hear it and I also pray to God that I won''t hear it again . But with God as my witness this is true . One more thing I would like to say that I have wondered about. <BR><BR>I mentioned the tractor pull and I''ve wondered if maybe the sounds the tractors were making when they would start to pull -the winding up sound of the motors could have been the reason this thing was hollering-maybe it thought there was another one around calling to it but in fact it was the tractors, I don''t know. I''ve thought about what everyone around where I live would be saying about me if they found out that I said I had heard bigfoot in the woods behind my house. If no evidence could be found to show that what I was saying was true, I would have big looney toon wrote across my back as long as I live here, I would be laughed at by everybody. Iv''e decided that I and only I know what I heard and I know how it''s affected me -I feel like I''ve had a close encounter with evil - something I had heard might exist but I didn''t really  ever want find out if they did, especially from personal experience . I know that I and only I will have to deal with this feeling and that I don''t really care what people here say as long as I know I''m telling the truth . If  somehow someone did this as a hoax, (no way) they did a great job. I''d have to say that they''re professionals. No way is this a hoax on my part. I''ve never been more serious about anything before as I am about this. Because I am so afraid here now, especially at night, I called the game warden back today and asked if could investigate this just to see if there might be evidence that this thing might have been or might still be in the woods here. He said that they hadn''t had anyone else report anything  like this but he would check it out. I don''t know if he will or not. The answer to my prayers would be for him to investigate it, find it, catch it, and take as far away from my house as he could go.

    " I was night fishing for catfish from a boat dock at the end of a dead end road adjacent to a wildlife refuge. It was middle of summer and the Mosquitoes were really bad so I decided to wait until after dark to go because they usually calm down after sunset. I had been fishing awhile with no luck when I started noticing something moving in the edge of the water, it was a river otter. I had never seen one before so I just sat and watched it for awhile. It was eating something maybe crawfish or muscles, I''m not sure but it was there for quite awhile. While watching it I started noticing large yellow eyes that I assumed was an owl. I would just catch a glimpse of them and when I would turn to look at them they would disappear. This went on for 30-45 minutes. All of a sudden the otter shot away from the bank and I saw something grey move from behind a bush to behind a cedar tree. The distance it covered was about 15 feet and it did it in a second and made no noise. I didn''t get a clear look it happened so quick, but whatever it was was big (if it was a side view like I assume from the direction of travel it was thick maybe 2 foot). Within 3-4 seconds after disappearing behind the cedar tree something big hit the water about 5 feet from the end if the dock where I was sitting and a fear came over me like nothing I''ve felt before. I grabbed my stuff, threw it in the truck and left as fast as I could. ",

    " My mother and I were en route to Mobile,AL from Boothville, LA. It was approximately 2 A.m. We left Interstate 10 travelling north towards the Dawes community where my mother grew up and most of our family still reside.  We crossed the smaller of two bridges in close proximity to one another when we saw what we first thought must be a VERY large dog sitting in the opposite lane of the road. As we approached we saw the creature was sitting on haunches as a dog would but was face to face with us in the car ( an 80''s model pontiac parisienne). It showed no fear and did not so much as budge as we passed it, it did turn it''s head and watch us as we drove by. Unlike a dog the creature had a human like face that was the only part of its body not covered in long reddish brown hair. Even seated on its haunches the creature was about the height of an average man. It was more slender in build than the average \"Bigfoot\" we have seen portrayed in reports of sightings in the northern part of the US.  We don''t want to say this was a bigfoot but after watching a special on the history channel my mother and I agree that the similarities are enough to contact you and see what you think.<BR><BR>We would like to add that local legends about the \"Grand Bay Wolfman\" are numerous and we heard stories about the \" hairy  man monster \" that likes to sit on bridges at night our entire lives, but up until we saw this thing for ourselves we never took them seriously.",

    " I am an avid outdoors man, I canoe and camp on a regular basis, mostly by myself (nobody spends any time in the wild anymore). On my most recent canoe/camping trip I had set up camp started a fire, and and had just finished my dinner at around 9p.m. I had put my drinks in the water on the edge of the river and was walking down to the edge of the river to grab on, when in about ten yards of the edge I heard a big splash, something being thrown or dropped in the water, I didn''t pay any attention so I kept walking, then as I approached the edge another even bigger splash was made and I could see the large rock that made it fly through the air hitting about ten yards from where I was. I froze and all the hair on my body stood straight up. I shined my led light over to the area and saw a set of eyes for about two seconds before they vanished. I fired my pistol to scare off anyone I thought would be messing with me, but no response, and this was on a week night where the possibility of someone roaming the area was not likely. I quickly packed my gear and left for home.<BR>The next morning I came back to the sight to look around and I heard something rustling in the brush, then I heard knocks in a steady patten of three I grabbed a piece of drift wood and knocked back. This continued for around five minutes, until I heard a car coming so I stopped because I didn''t want to give any curiosity to anyone, and I didn''t want anyone to think I was crazy. I left came back four days later and spotted a track. The track was around four-five inches longer than my shoed foot, which is a size twelve.",

Around Ten oclock P.M. i was in my hammock (i dont use a tent,i go lightweight)when i heard something,i guess you could say running down a steep hill across the trail from me.At first i thought it was a deer or some other animal but it stopped and started moving parallel with the trail. So i get up and get my fire going again to try and spook what ever it was off. Whatever was moving (ill just say IT from now on)went down about fifty yards and crossed the trail over to my side. I was kind of freaking out because it was so overgrown with vegatation that a flashlight was almost useless.I could hear IT cross back over the trail and move up the hill and come back the way IT came. It went past my camp about fifty yards or so and crossed the trail this time above where i was.About this time i figured out that it wasnt an animal so i was freaking out a little.This went on for about four or five hours off and on.When the sun came up i got out of there.I told some friends about what happened they thought it was probably a deer or maybe a dog but it sounded way to heavy for either of those.I done some research and came across your sight and kind of got it out of my system you could say but i saw where you guys had a expedition to North Carolina and saw some articles where people had encounters around the N.C. and T.N. border well thats where i was.",

    " The weekend of the 11th and 12th I went on a day hike at Old Forge campground just inside Cherokee national Forest. The trail heads East up into the Appalachians. On the Round Knob trail I noticed a 13-14in print that looked very human like. I could only see 4 toes but it appeared there was probably also a fifth. There''s lots of moving water in the area, but I didn''t see much in the way of wildlife. <BR><BR>The next weekend on the 18th I made another trip with a friend and walked the same trail. The print had been washed away so he didn''t get to see it. We got back to the campground and started a fire and just relaxed. At about 10:30pm we turned in. <BR>I couldn''t sleep very well, I fell in and out of consciousness all night. As I was laying in my tent listening to the snores and quiet I heard 2 wood knocks to the East and a few minutes later 1 wood knock from the West.

    " Let me first say I''m glad you folks are out there and believe as truly as I do that bigfoot is real. Back in the summer of 1995 myself and four friends were camping at the base of a mountain in our town in east TN. Normal night with our friends until the campfire died down. We were on an old road bed and had been breaking all kinds of dead trees for a fire and as we were doing this a lost hunting dog came up to us. When it did we gave it some peanut butter and the poor starving thing ate some then carried of the plastic jar we didn''t think anything else of him until a few hours later. The fire started dieing down and me and 3 of my friends were sitting leaning against the embankment as the dog came running back to us shivering. We were all kinda like what the hell \"I''m getting chills as i type this\" we were looking in the direction where the dog cam from and we saw a large, dark shadow just out of the light, just out of our clear vision from the fire. Me and my friends froze. The dog was whimpering and that''s not normal for a coon dog. We saw the shadow turn towards us and all we saw were the reflection of its eyes. It paused to look for all of 45 seconds and then, like it was shot out of a cannon this loud sound like it was running through the woods, breaking trees at this point. Fear had overwhelmed all of us. We had been in this area of the woods many times over the years we built the fire as large as we could and none of us slept the rest of the night. When we saw what we considered to be a bigfoot there was this terrible wet animal smell that was unmistakable. To this day I''ve never smelled an animal like it since. <BR><BR>Approximately 3 or 4 years later me and one of the guys were at the top of the mountain not far from there at a large natural sand cave and a large waterfall. We got bored as people that age do and and went on top of the sand cave to sit at the edge of the waterfall. As we climbed up to the top we had that same smell hit us and the same type of destruction was present. Trees about 3.5 to 4 feet up were just broken off like the first time we encountered this. We looked around and followed the path as far as we could until it ran out. We all still talk about this to this day and we all get cold chills when we do. I''d love to be able to speak with one of you or all. If you think this is worth your time, me and those guys would be willing to speak to you about this.<BR>",

We were walking along a trail that led from the lake we were fishing at to the parking lot through the woods. My son and I were in front of my mom and dad and I had turned my head around to tell them something and when I turned back around there it was. It was about 20-25 feet in front of my son and I. It looked to be about 8-9 feet tall. I didn''t see a neck on it and it looked straight ahead of it. It swung its arms when it walked and its strides were about 4-6 feet long. The trail itself was about 4 or 5 feet across. It was walking at about 5 mph. It was black with some brown mixed in. It walked very stiffly and the terrain it went on after walking in front of us was flat but thick with bushes and trees and I couldn''t see it anymore. I gasped and turned around real fast and told my mom and dad that I had just seen bigfoot. We did not go look for tracks because it was just getting dark and we kept walking.

    " My wife and I were new to the area so we decided to check out Frozen Head State Park.  We drove there in the early afternoon and decided to try to walk one or two of the trails in the park.  We took our two dogs with us as they love to hike, and if no one else is near us, we let them off leash so they can run up and down the trail.  Today was different.  The dogs never got more than a couple of yards from us and seemed stressed.  We thought their conduct was odd, but credited their behavior to the fact that they had not been out much since we just moved.   We started along the Interpretive Trail loop near the Old Mac Trail head.  We were enjoying ourselves as there was no one else on the trail.  We stopped next to a creek and I thought I heard a single knock, like someone hitting a bat against a tree.  I asked my wife if she heard it and she confirmed she heard the noise as well.  We thought maybe it came from hikers up ahead.  We walked along a little farther and heard what sounded like a tree fall in the distance behind us.  There was a little wind, and we have heard trees fall in the woods before, so we continued walking thinking nothing of it.   <BR><BR>We finished the Interpretive Trail Loop and decided to try another trail, this one called the Judge Branch Trail.  This trail parallels a creek and so we were just walking enjoying the woods when we came upon a muddy area with a lot of deer tracks. <BR><BR>I used to hunt in my youth and love trying to discern what animals are doing or where they are going by their tracks.  It seemed to me that two or more deer had been fighting or struggling in the area right off the trail, you could see various hoof prints going in different directions and the ground was torn up.  Looking for more signs we came upon the footprint that was in much more solid ground.  My wife (who is a skeptic) agreed with me that it looked like a large bare footprint and you could definitely see what might be a big toe and maybe indentions of smaller toes.  The print was off the trail and was perpendicular to the trail. There were some leaves and small sticks on top of the imprint which makes me think that it was an older print.  I weigh more than 280lbs and my shoes did not leave marks next to the print which was about a quarter to half inch in depth.  Not too long after this the dogs seemed to become more fearful, and my wife felt the hairs on the back of her neck raise up.   She felt uncomfortable and so we decided to end the hike and head back to the car.  We decided to put the leashes back on the dogs and they pulled hard towards the car.  When they got to the parking lot they once more became relaxed and calm.  <BR><BR>Also, I could find no other tracks, but we did not venture far off the trail either.  I am not familiar with bears but could this have been a bear track?  I would love to know.  <BR>",

    " On Sunday night July 15 (about midnight) I walked out of my garage and I smelled something musky, like a buck in rut or wet dog and I commented to my father about that, but just shrugged it off. It was overcast that night. On that particular night, across the road at another neighbors house, I could hear dogs barking, figured they were barking at coyotes or deer, at about the same time I could smell that musky smell. <BR><BR>On July 16th, I walked out of my garage to leave for work at about 7:30 am, when I noticed that one of the trees in my yard had a limb that was hanging down. I did not think anything of it at the time, except that I thought it was weird, since on the day before, there were no storms, heavy wind and the limb was fine, because I had mowed around the tree on the afternoon of July 15. <BR><BR>I returned home from work at 5 pm, changed clothes and decided to go look at the limb. I noticed that the limb was not broken in two, like someone had hung on it, but twisted so that is split. I took some clippers and cut it off.  The more I thought about it, the more I was puzzled, so I decided to go out to the burn pile that I had laid it on, and cut the twist out of the limb and take it inside to study closer. Showing my father, we both were puzzled. The limb looked like if you took a rope and twisted it, and the middle of the rope separates. <BR><BR>Enclosed are some photos that I took of the area, the limb and tree, along with an aerial photo showing where the tree is located and the layout of the land. <BR><BR>I did search for footprints and any other evidence, but there were none to be found. <BR><BR>I will also be getting the twist checked out, I only wish I would have kept it together and on the tree to begin with, since it would have been easier to study. Lesson learned this time. <BR><BR>There has been no further sightings, or damage found since. <BR>",

My husband manned the trolling motor on the front of the boat and me on the back end. Just slowly and enjoying the day and the fish that were biting and the sounds of the wildlife. We could hear the carp slapping the water surface deeper up the channel. We were there a good two hours. Husband looked up to start deeper into the channel but saw a dark, black, bulky body standing behind brush hunched over looking at us. He studied it and finally said to me \"well what the hell is that...(mumbled something).... and I asked him what/where... I saw the bushes moving slowly up into the woods as if someone/thing was fast-walking. <BR><BR>He said to be quiet until we got backed out of the channel. It haunts him still and we are trying to logic out what he saw. The odd thing was that just before my husband said he was seeing something, I got a day-ja-vue feeling and felt we were not alone, because the birds stopped their activity and went from feeling content and calm to feeling spooked. Like when crickets stop singing when disturbed. Was crazy, just can''t explain it. <BR><BR>My husband was scared and I never saw him act that way before. I know he saw something, I saw something moving the bushes cutting up into the woods. He first thought it to be the \"back end\" of a black bull/cow. Then he thought it to be a moonshiner or a big black man hiding. It was black and not in shadows. He saw no facial features and no outline of a head. That make sense?? It darted away quickly up into the woods as he commented to me that he was seeing this..... I saw the bushes moving up into the woods. We left. <BR><BR>",

All of the dogs, critters, etc. that were making noise went completely silent. We waited up,kind of scared, but never heard it again and the dogs, etc. never made any other noises either. My fiance is an avid hunter and knows all of the sounds out in woods day or night. He says he has never heard anything like that before. Whatever it was, it had to be something that all of the other animals knew to fear. ",

    " I''m sorry to say I don''t have a very exciting report.  Last summer when I was out at our cabin with our boys, I heard this really weird \"yelling\" from the ridge in back of our house.  Our cabin boarders the National Forest, so it gets pretty dense back there.  It was very late at night, and I was alone with the kids that night so I didn''t tell them (I didn''t want to spook them).  At first I thought it was some teenagers partying up on the forest service road, but that would be impossible to hear, really, and it wasn''t like that at all. The \"yells\" went on for a long time. They sounded, perhaps, 1/2 mile away? I was actually pretty scared.  There are quite a few houses up at our place, but almost noone is there but me and boys on week days. Also, a few weeks before my neighbor who is a hunter and such heard \"screaming\" from closer in to his place.  Just thought I''d let you know.",

    " It was in July 2006.  Not sure what day.  About 9:30PM.  I was walking from my garage to the house when I heard a terrible screaming in the holler at the back of our property.  I heard it again about 30 seconds later.  I have heard coyotes several times but this sound was like nothing I''ve ever heard.  It sent chills down my spine.  I mentioned it to my son a few days ago and he said \"you''ve heard that too?\"  I asked him when he heard it and he said about 3 weeks ago.  He too was walking from the garage to the house around 9:30 or 10 at night and heard a terrible screaming from the same location.  He''s a very skepticle person and never thought to mention it until I did.  I remember being at the back of my property in this location in the winter of 1989 burning some brush.  I sat down and then heard a loud grunting sound about 20 feet behind me.  I thought it was probably a buck but I never saw anything and nothing ran away like a deer would have.  Also in the summer of 1988 my wife and I went to the back of the property at night just to do a little exploring.  We had just moved there and were curious what it would look like at night.  We heard something moving in the cedar trees.  It spooked us and we went back to the house.  What ever it was followed us parallel on the path in the cedars.  We never actually saw what it was.   ",

    " There is not a lot to this incident, other than it occurred several (two or three) times over a summer. I was around 10 years old, and had all but forgotten these incidents in the following quarter century. Listening to the HOWL.WAV of the Ohio Bigfoot struck a real responsive chord. If I had to try and duplicate the sound that was heard, that would be as close as I could come. <BR><BR>Oh, you may have figured out by this time, we heard a sound. This was in a small, lower middle-class community that was not quite suburbs, not quite farms. Most houses sat on plots of land that were an acre or more. Though there were clusters of them that were spaced more like a regular neighborhood. Over that particular summer, the area was spooked by several nights of \"howling\". No sightings, that I recall, no tracks, just a low, moaning howl. My mother called me out of the house one night, to see if I could identify the source of this noise. I listened, it was fairly far off and difficult to hear and, of course, every dog in the area was putting their two cents in...and there were a lot of dogs... But it was like nothing I had ever heard before or since. As I said, the Ohio recording comes very close, other than there was maybe more or a moaning quality to what we heard. The serenade went on for five or six minutes, I remember it fading, not just cutting off. Almost as if whatever was howling was moving away from my ear-shot. I''ll admit, I was ten years old and it scared the hell out of me. My father worked nights and I was \"The Man\" of the house when he was away...and I was frightened... <BR><BR>The performance repeated a week or so later, this time the howling was closer...A neighbor said he''d pinpointed the source as coming from the flood wall at the end of our road. This was a large, mounded ridge that ran the length of the area and kept the Ohio River from flooding the farmland when it over-flowed its banks. On the other side of the ridge was a VERY deep, fairly thickly wooded \"ditch\" area. A creek ran through the area that was maybe twelve feet across and three feet deep in places. Forgive my rambling, I am typing all this as it comes to me. I have never sat and sorted this out... <BR><BR>The howls came back again at least once, later in the summer. The neighbors were spooked by these incidents, as I said, but I don''t believe anything ever came of it. There might have been a local news report on them, but I can''t swear to it. <BR><BR>Thanks for the opportunity to share this story. Hope it is of some use. Actually, I am hoping someone in particular is drawn to this sight and reads and recognizes this. Friends fade over time, but best friends are eternal. I''d like to talk to him again. :) ",

    " In June of 2005 my family had a strange occurance.  My son and a couple of his friends wanted to camp out down in the woods.  My husband and one of the other boys'' dad went down to check on them before we went to bed.  It was a full moon out and they were sitting down there with the boys when my husband saw something move between the trees.  He wasnt sure what it was and kept watching when he seen it move between the trees again he could see the moonlight between its legs.  They got scared and came up out of the woods.  Of course I didnt beleive him so the next day I went down there and found footprints.  One was a really good one that we actually poured a mold of.  Upon further scouting I found some odd things.  There was a bunch of little pieces of tree bark in a circle and it looked and felt like something might have been chewing on it.  We found moss rolled back, not tore up just rolled back.  And we also found tree limbs stuck in the ground kinda like markers.  Our friends didnt believe us so one nite we got a bunch of us together and went down in the same place my husband first saw it.  I had been interested so I did some research on the internet and took a little hand held recorder and recorded what was suppose to be bigfoot screams.  Around dusky dark my husband started playing the screams on the recorder he played them a few times and then all of a sudden we heard the god awfullest scream we''ve ever heard. It was high pitched and drawn out.  Everyone was shocked.  I dont know what it was but it wasnt too long after that, that a log, about the size of a piece of firewood came down out of the woods and landed by my vehicle.  After everyone got calmed back down we were standing around the fire when I thought I saw something just outside of the fire lite walking toward the creek.  I went and got back in my truck and about 2 minutes later it sounded like it picked up a creek rock and slammed it back down.  We all left after that.  The next weekend it was around midnite when my husband, my son and a couple of friends drove my truck back down there.  Without a fire it was really dark, they had a spotlight and my husbands'' friend was just randomly shineing it through the woods when at the same time my husband and another person in the vehicle said, \"there it is\" so he brought the light back to the spot where they seen it, my husband instantly started the truck up and his friend told him to shut it off and when he did they could hear it running through the woods.  They said it was just trashing it way up the hill.  But they saw it when he brought the light back down through the woods, it was behind a tree and they said it had red eyes.  Another odd thing was that all the grass was laid down flat kinda like in swirls.  And there is nothing down there that would lay it down flat.  I''ve seen deer bedding before but this was a large area that was flat by the creek.  We still go back there sometimes and we haven''t seen anything or any signs like we did that year.  Everyone thinks we are crazy which I probably would too if I hadn''t experienced it for myself.  Anyways thanks for taking the time to read this sorry its a few years late but it came up in conversation again and I wanted to share my story.",

    " My brothers and I were swimming in the creek across from my Mom and Dad''s house when I was 11 or 12 years old. I am 40 now and I can still see it very vividly in my mind''s eye. I had left my watch at the \"Deep Part\", which is what we call the part of the creek we swam in. I had tried to get one of my brothers to go back with me and get my watch. Neither of them would go with me. I tried for about anther half hour or so to get them to go with me to get my watch none of them would go. So it was about 4:30 to 5:00 in the afternoon when I finally got the nerve to go get my watch. The bottom that lead down to the \"Deep Part\" is approxiamtely 100 to 125 yards long to the fenceline to the waterjole where we were swimming. I got to in front of the neighbor''s which a little more than half to where the \"deep Part\" is at the fenceline. When I got to just infront of or just a little past their house, I saw a tall black figure, walking upright, walk along that fenceline. I saw it take 3 steps then my hair stood on end and I ran back to our house. I told my family and they said that I saw a deer. I am telling you guys this was no deer I saw it take 3 step, it was tall and it was dark colored. If I had to guess it was 7.5 to 8 feet tall and its stride was 6 to 7 feet long.

    " I would like to talk to you guys because a lot of other stuff has been occurring around my farm. A few months ago something screamed at me and then went who \"who\" like an owl. I looked up the scream on the web and the thing it sounded most like was a cougar, but the owl sound was not an owl. Other things that happens is rocks being thrown when I''m in garden, or at night when I get home and sit on back porch. Once when I was cutting fire wood at dusk and was loading wood something or someone threw a lot of rocks and made a ruckus. Also at night when I get home I sit on back porch to play with my dogs something hits the side of an old outhouse along with the rock throwing and screams. This happens most nights of the week. I''ve never seen anything but the day after the scream and owl call I went to where it sounded like it came from and found one track in an old rotten log. It looked like a person was barefoot and the track was the ball of the foot and the toes was showing but rain washed some of it away. Also this weekend I went to check out my treestands and beside one was a tree with big branches piled around it in a way that doesn''t look natural to me. Like I said I live on a 200 acre farm and my closest neighbor is a mile away. and I hear stuff and things get tossed off of hillsides night and day.",

    " My family and I (my wife and two daughters, aged 10 and 15) were vacationing in Mammoth Cave State Park (Diamond Resort specifically) from June 27 - July 1, 2003.  We had a cabin situated on a golf course at the resort.  We were in the area that was furthest from the pool, clubhouse, tennis courts and all other facilities.  We were in a condominium and at the time were the only family staying there.  Just after sunset, while still dusk (Astronomical twilight would be the most accurate term), I heard a load scream.  At first, I dismissed it as a Coyote, but then I heard it again.  After this vocalization, I realized that every other sound had discontinued - no crickets, birds, dogs - nothing.  It was absolutely silent.  Being a curator for the BFRO since 1998, my interest was understandably piqued.  The third vocalization was absolutely unmistakeable - the nearest human counterpart would be that of a women being brutalized and screaming as a result.  I immediately contacted Matt Moneymaker by cell phone to see if we could hear it again, but that was the last time.  It was very difficult given the terrain to determine distance or even location.  After the incident, I personally yelled and heard echos from nearly every direction.  Other than my sighting at the age of 9, this is the only other experience that I have had.  There is no question in my mind that this was a Sasquatch.  Why he/she was vocalizing is anyone''s guess!",

    " On June, 18, 2014 I set out to find where two creeks merge back in the woods. On the left of a old wagon road i noticed a 17 inch footprint at the edge of the road/path. A few feet farther another 7.5 inch footprint next too a tree about 3 feet high on the bank overlooking where the creeks merge. <BR><BR>Left my casting material in the truck; therefore, decided to walk back after taking pics.  Sunday afternoon the 22nd and after a few days of rains went back a different way. While walking next to the woods in a corn field i heard something trailing me in the woods. Determined it was somewhat large with all the noise it was making breaking  branches and logs on the ground. Went past the location where the creeks merge and doubled back. Walked towards the creeks and noticed a footprint in the field. The toes section was gone but the other 2/3rd of the foot was still there. A small print was on the back right side of the adults heal print about 2.5 to 3 inches long. Placed my backpack next to the print because no others around. The farmer had cultivated the field.<BR><BR> Walked to the creeks and chased something into the creek. It was large by the sound of the splash, like a belly busted splash sound. It ran off and started making growls. It would do a growl  then a second later do another growl. Then a few seconds 5 to 10 seconds of silence then another set of two growls. Did this for eight sets of growls and then i did a whoop, after that whoop... silence - not another sound. Spent days looking for growls like what i heard and on Legends Beware a video taken on 12/July/2013 at the counter mark of .18 and especially 1.40 is the growl. I have been back and left peanut butter but no other tracks except a lot of deer tracks. Believe they may be from a area to the west that people have noticed years before, it was getting too populated for them. ?   ",

    " Myself and a friend were bored one afternoon,so we decided to take his dad''s small john boat and look around some creeks just a couple miles from his house.After putting in a time or two,we found one that kept going and stayed wide and deep enough to follow it for awhile.We only had paddles so we moved fairly quiet,i guess.After paddling for a few hours,and having to get out from time to time and drag the boat over beaver dams,it had became late afternoon and the sun started to go down.We had been talking and laughing the whole time,so we really weren''t trying to be quiet.As we rounded a bend in the creek,we both saw a large piece of rock come flying out of the trees and land in the middle of the creek,making a big splash probably about 50 yards or so ahead of us.At the time,i was a police officer and was armed pretty much everywhere i went.That particular day we had been shooting trash like cans and bottles that we found alongside the roadway just up from where we put in at,so we were both armed.My friend immediately opened fire with warning shots in the general direction where the rocks came from, 5 or 6 shots as i was trying to turn the boat around.We normally wouldn''t have freaked out like that but,it was the manner in which it occurred that scared us.The rock appeared to be bigger than anything either of us could''ve picked up,let alone throw like that.Another thing was,the height from which it came.Which was about 2 or 3 feet higher than i am tall from what i saw,and i am 6 foot one.Also,it was heavily wooded,flat,swampy creek bottoms so it didn''t just fall from anywhere,and had the circumstances been where it could''ve fallen,it would''nt have landed in the middle of the creek.It would''ve just landed on the bank.After we got turned around and started paddling like crazy in the other back toward the truck,we didn''t hear or see anything,but we still didn''t waste any time.As it got darker,we started hearing footsteps up in the woods on our left.I say \"footsteps\" cause it didn''t sound like any deer hooves that i had ever heard,it sounded like somebody large and heavy.When we''d stop paddling,it would stop walking.It would walk only when we paddled.This went on all the way to the point where we got close enough to the road to hear traffic going by,and it was all the way dark by then and had been for some time.Once we got to the road,we loaded up and got out of there in a hurry,not hearing anything else and very shaken.There were no houses for miles in either direction from where we parked other than my friend''s house which was a few miles to the west and nothing to the east for roughly 5 miles.The property that the creek runs on is a 3000 acre tract of land that used to be a coal mine but had been shut down for several years.I tried to explain it away to myself but,it just didn''t add up.I always figured,even if it had been some person large enough to throw a rock that size,they would''ve said something when my friend opened fire on em''.And,they sure wouldn''t have followed us all the way back to the road for fear of being shot at again you would think.The swamp we were in runs across several counties, and is largely unpopulated in most parts so,who knows.",

But so many people had told us this story, and it was certain, that they believed it. I know what we heard that night, was no \"cat\". The grunts and raspy sounds were more similiar to a bear, but MUCH deeper and more throaty. And that howl or cry, was unlike any wild animal I had ever heard.

    "Actually, there were several odd things that I reflected on later. The first was that while I was listening for this strange sound, I realized later, that none of the normal Summer sounds were heard. No crickets, no katydids, no bullfrogs....none of the sounds that we always heard on a Summer evening were around. It was dead silent....until this thing let loose with this God-awful cry. Another was this odor that kept drifting up, it was really offensive. It''s hard to describe, but it was like a musty smell, that also smelled like death too. Anyone who has lived in the country, and has had a rat die within the walls or floors, knows what I mean. Add a strong musty odor to this, and it''s close to what I smelled that night. The third thing that I noticed, and maybe this is the oddest of them all, is that my horse was standing near the barn, when all this happened, and he acted like nothing was wrong. Even when these things were howling or crying, or whatever you want to call that sound, my horse just acted like he heard nothing. He continued to munch on grass, as if he neither heard nor sensed anything wrong. This has always baffled me.",

    "  <BR>In 1977 my husband and I bought a small hobby farm in Taylor County, Kentucky.....just outside the town of Campbellsville.   Our farm was surrounded by neighboring farms, but no one lived on the land bordering ours, the owners all lived in town.  So, our little farm was fairly isolated and I liked it that way. <BR> <BR>In the summer of 1978, I believe the month was July, my husband while alone at home, heard a sound one evening, that frightened the daylights out of him.......and he doesn''t frighten easily.    He called me at a friend''s place, screaming at me, \"where are the shotgun shells ?\".    His attitude, his franticness, scared me.  I didn''t know what was going on and he wouldn''t tell me.....he just kept screaming \"where are the shotgun shells ?\".    I finally told him and he slammed the phone down.     It wasn''t until later, that my husband related the story of what he had heard.      He never did see anything and years went by with no answers to that ''cry'' he had heard that evening.  (Although, for the first several years, as we watched ''nature'' films, which had various wildlife ''cries'', I kept asking him.......did it sound like that ?   To which he always replied \"No, it was like nothing I had ever heard before\".)<BR> <BR>Now, it''s 1988, again in the summer, and the month is August.  It had just started to turn dark in the evening, when my husband came in from outside and all he said was \"Do you want to hear that sound ?\"    He didn''t have to say anymore.  I knew right away what he was referring to, so we both went back outside and stood outside our kitchen window.   I was standing there listening when I told him \"I don''t hear anything\".  He quickly replied......\"Shhh.....just wait\".    So I continued to listen.   All of a sudden this horrible ''cry'' came up from our woods, where our two creeks merged.  It caused chills to run up and down my spine!  My first reaction was shock.  Then another ''cry'' was heard.   This time, I felt myself slowly edging backwards towards the house.  Whatever this ''thing'' was.....the ''cry'' was like nothing I had heard from any wild animal before and I remember starting to shake with fear.    Then another ''cry'' was heard, this time it came from across the road in the woods, where the creek continued to flow.   This cry hadn''t even \"cresendoed\", when there was another cry, heard from our side of the woods again.   Oh my God.......there were \"two\" of them I thought!!   That was it, I turned and ran into the house.   My husband came in with me, but he grabbed the shotgun and went back outside.   He wanted me to hold the light for him, as he investigated the woods.....and I stated \"You''re out of your mind, I''m not going back out there!\"  <BR> <BR>That basically was all that happened that night.  My husband never saw anything, nor did I.   But I did smell something.....it was a very strong musty odor, that wasn''t pleasant.   Actually, the odor was like wafting across with the gentle breeze.....so sometimes it was very light, and sometimes much stronger.  I remember wrinkling up my nose, when it was strong, and thinking \"what on earth is that smell ?\"     <BR> <BR>So now, after 10 years, I had heard the same sound that my husband had heard alone back in 1978.  The next day, I did go down to where the two creeks meet and walked along the banks, looking for strange prints, but didn''t see any.   Even though it was broad daylight, and a gorgeous sunny day......just being down there gave me the creeps.   What had happened the night before, had really shook me up and never again did I enjoy being down there anymore.    Just the replay in my mind of those ''cries'', was enough to make me ''jumpy'' whenever I was close to the woods/creeks area again.  <BR> <BR>The sound of those ''cries'' stuck in my mind....and I had a knawing feeling, that I had heard that sound before......but ''where'' ???    I was a video collector back then (still am) and quickly went through all of my video collection, to see if anything would jog my memory.    I have many natural wildlife tapes, so I thought, maybe that is where I had heard it.  But when I came across a movie entitled \"Sasquatch\", a feeling inside of me, told me to watch this tape.......so I did.   I sat in my living room and watched all the way through that movie, until close to the end....they had the sound......the very same sound......that my husband and I had just heard a few nights ago!!     As soon as I heard it, chills again ran up and down my spine.   I quickly rewound the tape, to the beginning of where that \"sound\" was and left it there until my husband came home from work that evening.    As soon as he came home, I told him I had something I wanted him to watch.   So within a few minutes, he was seated in the living room and I played the tape.   As soon as that ''cry'' was heard on the tape, he jumped up yelling \"That''s it!.......That''s the sound!!\"     We replayed that part of the tape over and over again.....trying to allow all this information to sink in.   We now felt, we *knew* what we had heard......it was a \"Sasquatch\".  Or actually, two of them........in the middle of Kentucky!<BR> <BR>An ''experience'' like this, you don''t ever forget.....you can''t!    It''ll stay with us, for the rest of our lives!<BR>",

    " When I was around 10, 11 or 12 (1975-77) Sorry, I don''t remember exactly -- it''s been a while. <BR><BR>When I was a kid, My grandparents had a little bitty camper at a campsite at Nolin Lake. I couldn''t tell you precisely where it was either. If I had to, I could probably get my father to tell me where it was, but that would mean I''d have to tell him this story ... Anyway ... one summer my father took the family (me, my sister and mother) to my grandparents site for a little vacation. One evening as it was becoming dusk, I remember standing inside the camper looking out the screen door at my father who was cooking at the grill. The campsite sat at the top of a hill in a wooded area. The woods consisted mostly of old growth, deciduous trees, so there weren''t really any evergreens or shrub-type trees like cedars which could really block your view. So I was looking out the door at my father who was on my left and eventually, out of boredom I guess, I ended up scanning to the right and down the hill into the woods.<BR><BR>I remember seeing about midway down the hill, something that caught my eye. You know how when you think you see something and in a split second your mind says, \"Did I just see what I THOUGHT I saw?\" Well that''s what happened to me. There he was. Midway down the hill -- I''m getting chills right now typing this -- partially hidden behind a tree was this \"man thing\" I could see his whole head, his right shoulder and part of his leg coming out from behind the tree. He/it was grayish brown and he was looking right at me (Maybe not -- but it sure felt like he was looking at me) I looked away thinking I had to be imagining it but when I looked back, it was still there and I had no problem picking him out from the trees. At that point my mother who was cooking at the stove behind me said something to me and I turned around to talk to her. When I looked back outside down the hill, he was gone. I kept looking through all the trees, but I couldn''t find him.<BR><BR>After that I was scared. I didn''t leave the camper the rest of the night. I was an avid comic book reader at the time, so I used that as an excuse to stay in. I remember I kept looking out the door that night just to check around and see if he came back and my parents kept asking me to come out and sit by the fire ... I didn''t dare tell my parents about what I saw because my father''s teasing is legendary in my family. He''s the oldest of 7 boys so he REALLY nows how to get under your skin.<BR><BR>What I saw was big and burley and it didn''t make any sounds that I can remember. It had a big, squarish head (kind of blocky with rounded corners) that looked like it sat right on its shoulders. I really don''t recall seeing a neck. I could see a massive shoulder and a thick bicep. I could also see its chunky hip and a good portion of its thigh down to about it''s knee. All the rest was hidden behind the tree. <BR><BR>From time to time I''ll see an animal show that will feature a three toed sloth, and every time I see a sloth I always think, \"That sloth''s hair looks like that bigfoot I saw when I was a kid\"<BR><BR>If you want, I can draw what I saw if that helps any.",

    " I saw a shadow of a beast, about 50 feet away from the edge of the field.... It was around 9:47pm and a few people went away from our camp fire to an open field to see the milky way. A dense fog had appeared over the higher field flowers and tall grass behind our camp site. As we were gazing up, I took time quietly to assess the landscape just under and to the left of my view of the big dipper, and over the fog in the open field. My eyes had adjusted to the night and a shadowy figure of a huge being started to appear. It was dark against the fog. It was in the middle of the field and looked to be standing, leaning forward on its left leg. There were no trees casting a shadow, there were no lights to cast a shadow. It gives me goosebumps to explain it. I was alarmed but was afraid that my friends were playing a joke on me, because it was my first time at the farm, to camp with them. I have been camping before and nothing has ever scared me other than spiders. I tried to point out what I was seeing. I didn''t yell, but firmly asked people to look at that and ask what is that?. But they couldn''t see what I was pointing at. It seemed that nobody was paying attention to me. At that time I decided to leave the group and head back to the fire out of my own fear and wanting to feel safe. They followed me, I felt a little bad I left my friends but they didn''t seem alarmed and were actually wanting an encounter. We sat by the fire and heard coyotes howling, for about 5 minutes then they abruptly stopped. I was afraid to go to bed until my tent buddy went with me. I kept my feelings to myself because I didn''t want to the butt of a joke, but I know what I saw.",

    " Im writing with a great deal of hesitation. I''m a police officer and married , family guy etc. and my credibility is sound . I don''t want this to change!... I used to do a lot of groundhog hunting around Seneca Lake and had an very peculiar experience there in August of 1988 . I would not be writing this If I hadn''t got a book from the library about Ohio Bigfoot by Chris Murphy and seen a website for BFRO.net . I was checking out the area when I heard a sound that chilled me to the bone . Allow me to continue. I was hunting a farm along SR 513 near Batesville and my friend dropped me off about 5:30 pm. I hiked up a steep hayfield and nestled myself in about 30'' from the hedgerow ( thick brush/ woods beyond ) in the 6\" hay and dressed in full camo proceeded to just be still & blend in for the next hour or so till the grounghogs became active . About an hour later I spotted the 1st groundhog and centered the crosshairs of my .243 win on him and gently squeezed the trigger . BLAM.. at that moment behind me in the brush I heard a heavy crashing sound . I chuckled to myself thinking I had spooked a herd of deer which had bedded down . Over the next 3 hrs or so I proceeded to take approx 8 more shots at chucks in that field . During that time I kept hearing intermittent twigs snapping .. enough to register as odd (deer usually take off for a further distance )  but not enough for alarm . As dusk fell I figured I would pick up the chucks I had shot ..The farmers dog would drag them to the house all rotten if you didnt !!! During this time I had never moved from my original shooting position. I had one round left for my rifle which I thought was handy in case a chuck popped up on the walk back to the barn. I stood up to stretch my stiff muscles and immediatly the brush at the edge of the field 30'' from me exploded with motion and noise ! I heard rapid crashing and a scream that I have never heard the likes of before. Instinctivly I swung the muzzle of my rifle in that direction and out of some primal reflex uttered a scream back .. it was like I had been challenged and I answered. I immediately forgot about picking up the groundhogs and started to make my way back to the farm in the failing light. I heard twigs snapping as whatever IT was, followed my progress in the brush.The whole time my rifle was pointed in that direction and the only thought I had was if it burst from cover let it get close enough to make my last shot count. As I got within a few hundred yds of the barn the sounds diminished as IT left. I mentioned this to my friend and he kidded me about hearing turkeys calling ... I KNOW WHAT TURKEYS SOUND LIKE !!! The taped Screams on this site are IDENTICAL  to what I heard that evening . <BR>",

    " We moved to this location two years ago.  We only lived here a few weeks and my four year old came running into the house and said he didn''t want to play outside anymore.  He seemed upset but not extremly frightened. When I asked him what was wrong he said he saw a monkey man looking at him through the trees.  I went out and nothing was there.  I looked around the area but didn''t see anything.  My son took me to the tree and showed me where someone or something was looking at him from between a fork in the tree. That was two years ago.  Yesterday my oldest son aged 15 was standing in the living room and glanced out the picture window. He said something huge and black ran from some trees we have there to beside the garage.  I was kidding and said, \"Is it bigfoot?\" And he said very seriously, \"yeah, I think it was.\"  I ran out the back door which is toward the opposite side of the garage than where whatever it was would be standing.  I ran behind the garage and to the other side but nothing was there.  I live near a heavily wooded area and the woods are close to the house behind and to one side of it.  The garage blocks the veiw of the yard and you can only see the front/side from the window. Whatever it was would have had plenty of time to run into the woods.  <BR><BR>Tonight my son''s friend Bobby was visiting for the night and was outside getting things ready to build a fire when he called my husband from his cell phone to the house.  He thought my husband or son was playing a trick on him and trying to scare him.  He told him to come out and when my husband went out to him Bobby told him something big was running from tree to tree looking at him.  He said it was black and even though it was dark he saw the outline of the face.  Which is why he thought it was my husband or son. This would have been about 40ft ending to 20 ft away from him. He said it came from right outside the tree line from the yard and then went into the treeline running from tree to tree looking at him and getting closer to him. Like it was trying to hide from him but still keep an eye on him. When my husband came out Bobby turned away to ask him if my son was playing a joke.  When he turned back it was gone.  They came in and told me so we went out with the camera and took some pictures of the woods in the dark.  I don''t know if I got anything or not. Whatever it is, from descriptions given to me, its about 6''-6''4 and since everyone says its about the size of my husband or son...husband is 6'' 215 and son is 6'' 240.. Note, the porch light was on and you can see the edge of the treeline because of the light. ",

    " My daughters, about 12 and 14 at the time, about 1977, were sitting on a small stone wall joining our patio in the backyard and I was up in the front yard. It was dusk, almost nightfall with very little daylight left. All of a sudden our three dogs ran down the gravel driveway from the front to the back of the house barking vigorously. I ran to the back of the house to find out what they were barking at. Here I encountered my two daughters; I asked them what the dogs were barking at. At this point in time there was no talk of a Bigfoot in Ohio, we never thought of anything being a Bigfoot. We had heard of a \"Sasquatch\" in the northwestern states but heard nothing of a Bigfoot in Ohio. My daughters told me that a large man ran right past them about 10 feet away running in a westerly direction. I said to them, Well when he runs into the barb wire fence, we will hear it. The dogs at this time were still barking and had followed this man in the direction towards the fence. They then stopped barking and returned to us. We never heard the man hit the barbwire fence. (No yelling and cussing) The girls described to me that this man was very tall, had unusually long strides, and was running very fast, they also perceived that the man had a \"cape-like\" thing that was flowing out behind him as he ran.<BR><BR>As we later discussed this incident we could not figure out what this \"cape-like\" thing could have been. We live in a rural area, and we have 15 acres of property with a horse pasture, we thought what man would be running through a rural area at almost dark. We thought he might have been a jogger or cross country trainer late in getting home, and started running through peoples property to get home as it was almost dark. <BR><BR>Years later as we heard about a possible \"Bigfoot\" in Ohio, which led to a discussion with my two daughters, now much older, about what they had seen in 1977. We discussed the \"cape-like\" thing that this so called jogger had on. We had as yet not figured out what this \"cape-like\" thing could have been until our knowledge about a possible Ohio Bigfoot. In talking about it with my daughters we came to the conclusion that this might have been a Bigfoot that they saw. And the cape was actually flowing hair from this possible Bigfoot. We also questioned how this \"runner\" could have got over the fence without hitting it. If it was a Bigfoot it probably leaped over the fence on the run. This incident comes up in family discussions from time to time. We decided to file this report as the topic of Ohio Bigfoot has become more pronounced in our family.<BR><BR><BR>",

    "On Halloween weekend of 2005, several relatives and I went to this park to explore in the afternoon. Ive found lots of tree sign and wanted to show them. We took the main trail and came to a spot where the main preserve begins. Theres a swamp there and a foot trail or two going into the preserve (no main trail). At this spot, my brother began doing his Bigfoot calls which he does very well. My niece began making wood knocks with a large branch. This went on for several minutes as we walked around having fun. Suddenly a few of us heard a low growl coming from in the preserve. There was talking and day noises going on (the area is not secluded but in the midst of civilization), so it wasnt heard by everyone in our party as we were scattered as well. Also, the growl was not high pitched. It was very low and rumbly and I could feel the vibration of it. My brother said whatever was making that growl had to be a very large creature. The growl happened approximately three separate times in a row. We were amazed. We never saw what was doing the growling, but I felt it was definitely a warning growl from a Bigfoot to make us stop imitating their sounds and knocks. My brother put it like this (from the Bigfoot): Okay, you know were here and now you know we know that you know. Now get the hell out and leave us alone!Last summer at night (around 10:00 or so), a girlfriend and I were at the park (parked near where I had my sighting). We do this often to see if we can hear anything unusual. When we first got there, we decided to walk around. We got out off the car and immediately heard a distinct, low whoop sound. My friend, who has never heard the big foot sound recording, said That was unusual. I recognized it immediately from your recordings. Now, there are houses and private drives in this area right at the edge of the preserve, but there are also lots of trees and a cliff running along the preserve edge -- lots of hiding places, especially at night. We walked around and then got back in the car to listen some more. Heard coyotes howling, owls hooting, and mourning doves cooing back and forth, which we found unusual at night. At one point, we both heard heavy breathing fairly close to our car. To me, it sounded like a gorilla breathing heavily. My friend agreed. We never saw anything. Later on we heard bipedal footsteps coming near our car. At that point, we became afraid and left the area.This past spring I went for a walk in this park around 9 a.m. It was clear, cool weather and there was no one else in the park but me. I hadnt walked far along the trail when I began to hear Canada geese honking in the preserve (I couldnt see them). Not unusual at all, but the honking continued and became louder and grew into such a crescendo of noise, it was as if the geese were screaming. It was above and beyond the normal racket they make. I stopped and listened, wondering what was going on. After a minute or so, the noise began to die down. Then right afterward when it had stopped, I heard sharp wood knocks. It happened three times and each time it was three knocks. Knock knock knock pause knock knock knock pause knock knock knock. The hair on my neck stood up. I knew that Bigfoot was on the move in the preserve, possibly hunting geese and signaling to each other afterward. It was thrilling.In the year that Ive been exploring this area (mostly alone), Ive had several minor incidents that I believe are Bigfoot related. Ive had a snowball thrown at me that hit the top of my head, heard various wood knocks, had two large rocks thrown into a creek while I was standing on a bridge with my back turned (saw the two big ripples from the rocks that came out of nowhere), have found a suspicious footprint from time to time (nothing dramatic), and have seen tree sign progression (one day a large tree was pushed over onto the trail, the next day the park sawed it up into large sections, the next day I came back to find a large section of the tree jammed high up into another tree (impossible for a human to do this). In all the time Ive spent there, I have never once felt terrified or threatened in any way. If anything, Ive felt like many of these happenings were caused by playful juvenile bigfoots, but I have no proof.",

    " I had been told about recent Bigfoot sightings in this area, so Id been on the lookout for Bigfoot and sign ever since.  I knew that many sightings had occurred after rainfall.  One night last August, after a day of bad storms that ended by evening, on a whim I decided to drive to this park at night.  It was an eerie night with distant lightning flashes in the sky.  Theres a road that leads to a parking lot.  At one point the road sharply veers to the right into the parking lot.  If you were to go straight, you would be driving down a private drive.  <BR><BR>As I turned down this road, looking straight ahead down this private lane, I saw big eyes looking back at me.  There was one set of very large, close together, blue-white eyes high off the ground.  They almost looked cartoonish in shape, they were so large.  They were oval and sort of cocked toward each other like a cartoon figure.  They were totally unthreatening looking  in fact, my impression was of a gentle and frightened creature.  Halfway down this large creature I saw several smaller blue-white eyes.  I never saw a pair, though.  They were just random blue-white dots in several places halfway down the creature.  When I first saw the eyes, I stopped my car and just stared in disbelief.  The eyes didnt move for several seconds.  Then the tall big-eyed creatures eyes started to sway back and forth.  When it did that, the shorter eyes all started to move, appearing and disappearing and moving around in a smooth and floating manner.  I never saw figure shapes or fur.  Just eyes.  When everything started moving, I panicked unfortunately, turned my car around and got out of there as fast as I could.  What can I say?  Im a female and I was alone at night in a park looking at strange eyes.<BR>  <BR>I went to my sisters house 10 minutes from there and told her about it.  She got her son and his girlfriend, and the four of us went back to the sighting area to explore it with flashlights.  We saw nothing  no prints or sounds or smells.  However, it was a noisy night insect wise, but when we walked in the sighting area, it was eerily quiet.  Two things I noticed.  By seeing my nephew and sister in the same spot where I saw the eyes, it was apparent that the adult creature was much taller than they are.  Also, I was able to clearly see my relatives shapes and clothing.  I couldnt see the creatures shape, so it (they) must have been very dark from top to bottom.  My general impression was that I stumbled upon a female with her young children out walking around after the heavy rains that day.<BR>",

It was around midnight and we were watching TV when we heard some dogs barking like they were after something. We looked out the door and we seen something big like a large human running with the dogs chasing it. It ran under a street light but we still couldn''t make it out. As it ran it made some terrible screaming like I have never heard before. The next day I went home and my mother asked me if I heard the terrible screaming sound last night. She said our dog ran and hid under the bed and it scared my sister to death. She said what ever it was it ran right beside our house. I went out and did find some very large bare feet tracks by our house in some mud. But nobody thought much about it when I showed them. We are by some railroad tracks and some woods so I believe it was following them and maybe came looking for food. I still can''t explain where the dogs came from.

    "  Well, this is kinda weird because I have been wanting to see a sasquatch for many years now and I believe I had a brief look at one about a week and a half ago. I was driving east on Sagamore Rd. in Sagamore hills Ohio at about 10:33 am to be exact. It was a very Hot muggy day with tempetures in the 90''s. As I was driving east on this rd. their is a jogging trail that crosses the road and is actually part of the Cuyahoga Valley National Park system. The trail area was about 100 to 150 yds ahead of me when from the right side of the road I seen a dark figure come out onto the road with such speed that their was no way it could have stopped to look for cars before crossing, this thing was dark brown or black from head to toe. It crossed the road and the open area before the road when I first seen it in 3 strides and it was gone. This thing had the speed of an animal and it held its forearms up high kind of reminds me of the memorial day footage. I also seen a flash of silver or gray color by the forearm and head/face area like it looked my way in the last stride it took. When I first seen it I thought heck it had to be a jogger. The more and more I thought about it I felt that it couldnt have been a jogger for a few reasons, 1 it was 90F + and I couldnt imagine someone dreesed in such dark colors from head to toe, 2nd is the speed this thing had was not humanly possible, if I had blinked my eye I would have missed it, if I would have had a camera I would have missed it anyway because of the speed. 3rd is I am 5''10'''' and it took me 5-6 strides just to cross the road in that area which does not include the area that is viewable to the right of the road where the creature first stepped out into.4th is since I have seen this I have driven that road many times to and from work, I have been at about the same distance in my van and have seen joggers cross the road and their arms look like toothpicks compared to what I had seen on that day, as far as guessing a height of the creature I would say it was well over 6ft. but cannot be any more sure than that because their is nothing their to have compared it to but it looked stocky for sure from that distance.",

    " In the summer of 1976, I (Laurie) was playing along the shores of Aurora Lake when I came upon a very large set of human like footprints.  There was two very clear footprints in clay and a lot more less recognizable in the hard soil.  My best estimate was the tracks were at least 15 inches long by 7 inches wide.  Compared to my size 8  women''s shoe <BR>they were enormous.  Not knowing about Bigfoot, I passed them up as a case of mistaken identity or just a practical joke.  I could clearly see the five toes on both tracks in the clay.  The one thing I remember the most, was how impressed I was about those tracks. <BR><BR>Then, the following summer of 1977, I wanted to show a girlfriend (Jane) of mine the area where I played my entire life as a kid.  It was just after my senior year of high school when we decided to take a hike into the woods so I could show her my favorite tree I played on my whole life.  How I knew my way to this spot was by following the creek bed into the area until we reached my hang out spot.  Upon arriving at the spot, I noticed something very strange!  On the right side of the creek bed, at about 20 feet away, there was a strange matted down area that I have never seen in the 10+ years of coming here.  It looked like something had matted down all the 4 to 5 feet weeds and trees into some sort of bed or nest.  The area was at least 8 feet wide by 14 feet long.  The strange thing was that all the outer bushes and trees were bent outward from the middle as if done deliberately.  As my friend and I checked out this strange thing, we both heard the sound of heavy foot falls coming towards us.  We tried to see the source of the foot falls but the foliage was so thick we couldn''t see anything.  As the foot falls got closer, the sound of breaking twigs were heard with every step.  Being an outdoor person all my life as well as an experienced hunter, I know for a fact that whatever was coming towards us was bipedal and wanted us out of there. <BR><BR>Being very frightened, we slowly made our way back to the road via the creek bed.  Whatever it was, followed us all the way out to the road.  As we looked into the woods, we could hear it moving through the foliage not getting closer than 100 feet away.  I never mentioned the word Bigfoot to my girlfriend in fear of ridicule.  Now I knew what was responsible for the <BR>footprints found the previous year at Aurora Lake less than a 1/2 mile away.  I never told anyone about this incident until just recently. <BR><BR>",

    " I have just read \"A.D.''s\" April 1997 report about a loud animal-like noise in the wooded area behind an apartment complex on the East side of Kent. I have lived in this same apartment complex for nearly twenty years and have often heard this incredibly loud howling sound. I agree with A.D. that the sound is difficult to describe. It is a very loud, somewhat high-pitched sound that originally suggested an animal in pain. I have recently taken up an interest in Bigfoot, and after some books on the subject began to wonder whether the sound I heard was perhaps one of the creatures. Then this morning I ran across A.D.''s report and thought, \"Ah-ha! So I am not the only person who has wondered about these cries.\" After giving thought to the possibility that the cry is that of Bigfoot, it crossed my mind that rather than a cry of physical pain it might be instead a cry of emotional pain, the cry of a lonely being hoping to hear an answering cry. I have only heard the cry at night, and not as I recall in winter. For many years the cry was fairly frequent. I have not heard it now for more than a year. The area behind the apartment complex is heavily wooded. There is a dirt roadway that goes back (north) a hundred yards or so to a gas well drilled about four or five years ago and then capped off and left untended. Another fifty yards or so north is a railroad track with frequent trains. Beyond the track is more woods, within which is the remains of a toxic waste dump that was cleaned up by the EPA eight or ten years ago. Beyond that the woods ends into some homes and the town of Brady Lake.",

As we approached another tree line and we were about to enter the woods we heard what sounded like someone throwing a HUGE rock through the trees. It landed a few feet away from us just inside the tree line. It was so large and hit so hard we felt the ground vibrate with the force. We all jumped sideways in fear of getting hit.

My truck was parked roughly 20ft behind us. Throughout the night I heard tree knocks and calls not common to the area. When we heard a few getting closer we decided to leave. When i went to the back of the truck where we kept our gear and the fish the 7lb catfish was gone. We looked around the truck and area to see if it had hopped out and saw nothing. While searching my partner was hit on the chest with a small rock leaving a half dollar sized mark. We packed up and left fast since we felt very scared at that point.

At first they looked human, but I thought it was odd a person would be walking barefoot it some of the nastiest deepest and thick mud slop around.  The inlet along the shores of a lake was covered with pricker bush and briars.  I followed the tracks for about 400 yards until they cut through a mud swamp.  A person would have taken the easy dry trail, these tracks went through the mud swamp.  I tried to step through the swamp but sunk over my boots.  Thats when I really looked hard at the tracks.  They were not outrageously long, I say about size 10 but the were very narrow and they sunk alot deeper in the mud than my 200 lb frame did.  The toes were very strange and appeared to be much longer than a humans, the left foot looked like it had suffered an injury to two of the interior toes.  The stride was long and I had to strech to walk the same path.  I''m six foot tall.  I circled around the swamp a caught the tracks on the other side of the swamp inlet and followed them for another 300 yards until I lost them back on dry ground where they went into the forest.",

    " Hello, I am writing for my mother as she is not very good with a laptop. They live in Valley City, Ohio. She saw something last night that has really scared her and didn''t know who she could ask about it. Here''s a little background. Over the past couple months they have heard deep growls off and on but have never seen anything. They live in the country with a river and woods across the roads both in front and behind the house. They never go outside at night unless they can help it because it just doesn''t seem right out, sort of like they are being watched. Then this morning about 3 AM my mom was in the kitchen making coffee and looked out the large window on the side of the house and saw yellow eyes looking in at her. As she had the light on in the kitchen, she couldn''t see the full body, but the window was open and she smelled a musty skunk smell. This was the only window that the blinds were not closed. Needless to say the coffee never got made. It scared her really bad. She went to the living room and sat in the dark until it got light outside. Then when it got light she went outside and said it smelled like a herd of skunks had been around. The window is fairly high on the side of the house and I am about 5'' 2\" and can barely look in the bottom of it. We estimate that where the eyes where on the window it had to be close to seven foot tall. She said her iris flowers and some other plants were smashed down under the window and all the corn for her squirrels was missing. She couldn''t see any tracks because of the plants and the ground was dry. ",

We both looked at each other and said did you just see that?!!  The subject was down low and bent in the middle as it moved. Unlike a dog, its undulating movement was not as fluid as a dog. It was not a bear. It appeared to be from 4-5 feet at the back and torso built like a barrel. When it went into the cattails we were no longer able to see it.<BR><BR>",

    " In the month of June 2008 I was camping with my partner and her sister at Beaver Creek State Park, Columbiana County, Ohio. I had camped and hiked in that park since I was a little kid, and felt comfortable there and knew the woods, trails, area well. We had been camping for 2 days, and were on our second evening. We had a campsite in the \"pines\" side of the campgrounds. In the evening, around 8:30, I went a ways into the woods behind our site to \"answer the call of nature\" so to speak. While I was going number one I heard a loud crash, it startled me as I thought it sounded like a deer crashing off. I jumped up, and saw a dark very muscular figure hurrying off quickly in the direction diagonal to our site and our camping neighbor. It was very dark, with bulging deltoid muscles. I could not get in my head what the heck was happening, as it was human form but appeared like it had no clothes on, plus black. The figure moved quickly, without reaching up to brush branches away like most people would do going thru the woods. It headed back toward where there''s nothing but a steep drop off ravine. I told my girlfriend and her sister, both were scared and wanted to leave. I insisted on staying as I was so fascinated at what I thought I saw. We spent a restless night and got rained out the next morning, quickly waking up before dawn. We haven''t camped there since. I now live in Powell, north of Columbus and have only camped at A.W.

    " In the summer of 2010, my family had met my sister and her family at the end of a bay at Tappan lake in Harrison county, Ohio. We were fishing at a point of the bay where you had to walk approximately 40 to 45 yards to the lake shore. My wife Amy had decided to walk back to our van for another chair and I decided to go with her because the trail was a bit winding through the woods. As we went, we heard a \"whooping\" sound not too far from our location. My wife asked me what it was and having never heard anything like it at the time and thinking rationally, I said it was an owl.<BR><BR>Then, about a year later, while watching an episode of Finding Bigfoot, she heard the same sound that we heard that night at the lake. I wont tell you what she said to me, but she is now a firm believer. We haven''t gone fishing at Tappan lake at night since that experience. ",

    " August 1991 Stark County, East Canton OH near to US Route 30<BR><BR>It''s hard to say where these stories come from. When I was younger I had always read about them with a grain of salt. I mean you never really take anything serious that you read about unknown phenomena, if you haven''t experienced it. I think this just added to the surreal experience, in which I am about to finally indulge after all these years, whether anyone ever reads this or not.<BR><BR>I was not a Bigfoot enthusiast by nature. As any other person who has shared an experience likewise can tell you, that all changes the moment you are faced with one.<BR><BR>It was late August 1991 in a small town called East Canton in Northeast Ohio. I don''t have an exact date. That never seemed very important to me at the time.  I know it was during that month. I grew up in East Canton, and knew the surrounding forests quite well, from plenty of hiking time with my dad and friends.<BR><BR>It was not a good day. I had an outrageous argument with my girlfriend and simply had to take off for awhile. I decided to take to the woods for the night. I sometimes liked to hike and camp by myself, but it wasn''t my style at that time. I had just gotten a used Ford Tempo which instantly changed my life. My days of woodland hiking/camping was over, for now anyway. At that time, I would have preferred to hit the mall or something meaningless like that. Thank God, I didn''t. I packed up a small supply of gear to go camping for a night all by my lonesome.<BR><BR>I knew exactly where I was going, the spot was perfect. I had camped there before, countless times. About two miles from my parent''s house was an endless setting of woods. In these woods was a series of old abandoned coal mines. Above these caves was a gorgeous surrounding of pine trees. I am not sure how they was able to root above these caves, but they made for an absolutely gorgeous setting.<BR><BR>Naturally, nothing makes a better bed than pine needles. All I really brought was a blanket to lay on, which was my first mistake. A machete for chopping fire wood and the standard nighttime armor, my trusty flashlight. I always like to travel light and sometimes, later regret it. You start to wish you would have brought a heavier blanket or sleeping bag when it gets cold.<BR><BR>My friends, Pete & Joe (names changed, witness'' request) came with me to help set up camp. Which there wasn''t much to it,  I think they just wanted to hang out. So began the greatest quest of man, starting of the mystical fire. We made a huge clearing of the pine needles so there was no chance of a spark to set it off, and laid rocks around it. We was always really careful about this because we knew the owner of the land and he permitted us to hike or camp there anytime we felt like it.<BR><BR>The sun was setting fast. Pete & Joe had to leave because they had to work early in the morning. I was glad. Not that I didn''t enjoy company, but I needed to be alone to ponder the things that man does wonder.<BR><BR>The fire was going real well. Since it was August, the nights would get very cold. So, fire good. Cold bad. At this point I was finding peace. It was a stressful day and well, needed silence therapy. The wilderness can be intoxicating if you set your attention towards it, and a great way of getting away from everyday problems. Well not this night anyway.<BR><BR>At the time I had pop bottle glasses. I mean these suckers were thick. But I had perfect vision through them. Since then I have had lasik (laser correction) surgery and you will read on my purpose for that very soon. So I took my pop bottle glasses, and very carefully laid them very close to my blanket. If you''ve ever owned glasses and cannot see very well, you will understand, this is an insecurity.<BR><BR>A few twigs snapped around me. I''m not going to kid you, when you hear that kind of stuff when you are alone in the deep dark woods, it scares you for a minute. Ultimately, nothing I have not heard before. I then realized it was something small, a little rabbit or squirrel. <BR><BR>I was quite comfortable. I fell to sleep very fast. The doors of the unknown were about to be opened.<BR><BR>At 3AM I wake with a very startled, uneasy feeling. I know I didn''t have a nightmare, but I had a much more intense feeling that I was rudely awakened. Nothing seemed outwardly different with the camp, however, the weird sense was there. I''d felt this peculiar sense before. I am not exaggerating, and I hope that other people that have had the same kind of  experience can relate to this sense. It was the feeling of being watched, on an extreme level. Not your round about chill or alertness, I am talking an intense sensation. That tingly sensation that tells you that you are not alone and danger may be near. This sensation, was like a physical tingling behind my ears. It was like hypersensitivity. I guess like a Spidey-sense, if you will. I know I am not Spider Man, but if I was, this is probably what it would feel like when trouble was ahead. <BR><BR>As all of you with glasses would know,  I immediately rush to find them and jam them onto my face. Dead silence. There isn''t a cricket chirping, a tree frog singing, or anything. Just cold, dead silence. I however pass it off as a bad dream. Mind you, at this point I still have not heard anything, or understand why I seem to have been rudely awakened.<BR><BR>I notice I am freezing. I am very cold and the fire is on its last red coals. I immediately lean over and start blowing on the coals to restart it. That''s when it happened. I heard the most blood curdling scream (or shrill) I have ever heard, to this day. It sounded unnatural. This \"scream\" will never be able to be documented on paper by anyone, for anybody to understand it, unless they hear it themselves. It was simply terrifying, and unnerving. The kind of sound that shoots right up your spine and seems to peak through your every nerve. The octave levels of this scream was beyond my comprehension. If I didn''t have ears, I still would have heard it.<BR><BR>Let me expand more on this heart stopping shrill. Your first animal instinct reaction is two choices. To curl up into a little ball and hope it goes away, which is what I was feeling at the moment. Or flee as fast as you can. Those who ever read this, which will be very few, that have experienced this will know exactly what I am talking about. This scream I imagine will haunt us for the rest of our lives. A quick note on the bizarre side. I also had the instinct to yell back. Don''t ask me why. It was one of those feelings I had that I cannot explain.  I did have to suppress myself to keep from yelling back. Maybe some kind of primordial defense mechanism? I''m going into weird territory here, but I felt a connection like that. Maybe someone else has felt the same, or else I am totally nuts? I am particularly interested in why I felt this. The fact is, it was a very surreal situation, and I didn''t know how to react.<BR><BR>I remember my first thought, and that was \"you''ve got to be \"%^*#^&\" kidding me.\" Because I have never heard anything like it in all my life. It sounded similar to the apes I would hear in old National Geographic documentaries, but much louder. This was Ohio though, not Africa. And it wasn''t just once. This screaming continued in approximately 5-10 second intervals on both ends of my camp. On each end I heard rustling and shrills, as if they were screaming back and forth.<BR><BR>I was shocked once again when I seen something thumping across the land. Fear took over. A large two legged something, thumped its way about twenty to thirty feet away through my camp. I say thumped because if you remember, I was sleeping on top of a series of caves, which essentially was like a floor. So I felt every step this creature made.  It didn''t swing its arms around like a gorilla, but had features similar, from what I could tell. However, I can 110% guarantee it was no man.<BR><BR>It was a moonlit night so I could see that is was very large and hairy. The top of its head reminded me of a gorilla''s. It was mostly hair covered with some exceptions much like an orangutan. The hair color looked black, but could have had other colors with it. All dark hair looks black at night, and all hair has many colors that people don''t immediately see without observation. <BR><BR>It was a side view, so I did not see the eyes.  I wish I could have. I cannot give you a valid height. I did not see the full height, because it was running on a ledge. So I couldn''t see below its calves. All I could see is it was massive. I am giving you the best description I can give of what little time I had to observe the creature. He/she didn''t pose for me. All I know is it was colossal and I was frightened. My only conclusion at this point was that the ridiculous myth of bigfoot was real. That, or I was losing my mind.<BR><BR>I was still hearing the yell from the rear of the camp as well. Which lead me to believe there was two or more. One thing I should mention is I did not smell the stench that so many encounters have mentioned. Perhaps because it was such a still windless night? <BR><BR>My only instinct from that noise was, get out. Whatever it was.  It was saying, \"you are not welcome here,\" In its own language. I heeded the warning. I obviously picked the wrong place to sleep. <BR><BR>My Dad always taught me not to run from wild animals because they sense the fear.  I grabbed my flashlight, and left everything else sit, and fearfully walked out...very fast. When I was about twenty feet away from the camping area, the continuous screaming ended. The silence was comforting, to an extent. I no longer felt in the immediate danger that I thought I was in initially and I did not hear anything following. When I cleared the woods and hit the road, I ran. I ran the entire distance to my parent''s home to what seemed like the hardest haul I ever pulled. My chest hurt from breathing so heavily.<BR><BR>I urgently beat on my Mom and Dad''s locked door (I did not live there anymore). Mom rushed to the door. Naturally I had to catch my breath, but I eventually was able to recite what I just explained. Soon after, my Dad arrived home from work, and then I told him. This is coming from a nineteen year old kid mind you. They were good parents and listened. I am not so sure they believed me, but they agreed, something traumatic happened to me, to set me in such a disturbed mood. My dad had been Morel mushroom hunting for a few decades or more and had never seen anything like that before.<BR><BR>Time has passed. I guess it was time to write all this down. I wanted to write this mainly for myself. I want to remember it as clear as I can. Every detail I recited in this is exactly how I remember it. No exaggerations.<BR><BR>I would have through time, discarded this as a mere psychological episode. But I have not finished the story for you. The next day was equally thrilling. I knew that if I mentioned this to too many people it would be devastating. I had to tell someone what happened, and who better to tell than your trusting best friends, right?<BR><BR>My two closest friends, once again were Pete & Joe. I explained this to them, and got the truthful expressions from them that I expected. Pete believed me to an extent, I think. But Joe took me for an idiot I think.<BR><BR>Since I still was not on speaking terms with my girlfriend, the three of us decided to go camping in the same spot together. I wasn''t about to take the day and go back by myself to retrieve my precious bear blanket. The word \"alone\" was not an option at this point and time.<BR><BR>Why go back at all you ask? Well, its like this. When a man is alone he is alone. When he is with his buddies, he is an Olympian. Besides, I knew that lightning never strikes more than once in the same place. I mean come on, the chances of this same thing happening again were absurd.  I was concerned but didn''t feel like it would happen again.<BR><BR>That night, armed for battle, my friends and I headed for the woods once again. Much to my surprise, everything I left untouched. Nothing was out of the ordinary at all. No big fat footprints, no clumpy hair on tree branches, nothing. It was all still very dry from the summer. I''ve already begun to doubt my sanity. I am a skeptic, and generally believe nothing until I am presented with evidence.<BR><BR>That is why we all elected to bring a tape recorder this time. We bought brand new batteries for this really cheap Radio Shack piece of junk recorder and set it up by our camp.<BR><BR>Let me tell you a little bit about my friend Joe. Where I pack light, he is opposite. He was a Boy Scout (may have still been at the time, may still be now), and insisted on building his own personal living room right there in the woods. So where last night was blanket and machete, tonight was cot, tents, army gear, pellet guns, hot dogs and chips. Woohoo.<BR><BR>Pete was very much like me. We were gung ho and liked testing ourselves with having less. It''s not like one night is much of a survival test.  I only explain this to you to maybe get a grip on our personalities a little. So you see we were not Bigfoot enthusiasts on the hunt for the big score. We were casually camping out, as we had done many times before.<BR><BR>In fact the previous night rarely entered my mind until God turned the lights out on us.  So here we are, looking straight up into the starry sky through the pines, with full bellies from complimentary snacks from Joe''s workplace. Once again a very clear and starry night.<BR><BR>Slowly we each dosed off, me being last as usual. I finally got comfortable with my surroundings. I convinced myself that the danger of last night, that still seemed all too familiar, was over. It is back to innocent camping.<BR><BR>3AM on the nose I awoke like clockwork. You ask, how could this be? I asked the same at that very moment, when I looked at my watch. How could this be? I woke once again at the same exact moment from the night before. With that dreaded feeling of unease...again.<BR><BR>The fire seemed to be in the exact same condition, the coals slowly fading away. I was very cold again. The silence was unbearable. I looked over and seen Pete was awake too. His eyes the size of quarters. He had a strange look of fear on his blood drained face. I asked what was wrong. He just replied \"I don''t know.\" It was a repeat of last night''s show, which I did not want to sit through. I knew something had happened yet again, to startle us in this manner.<BR><BR>I start blowing on the fire. The scream bursts out just like the night previous. Once again I am in a surreal situation. Over and over I ask myself, how can this be? The scream echoes our wilderness surroundings with great intensity right when I am blowing on the fire, at the exact same time as the night before. I''m sure Bigfoot doesn''t have the same synchronized Swiss Army watch strapped to his or her own wrist. So I am not sure why this happened on the nose again.<BR><BR>One point I would like to make, is on both nights, I was obviously rudely awaken by the scream, but couldn''t remember it because I was coming out of sleep. That''s the best I can conclude for waking up with that unease.<BR><BR>Pete hits the recorder.<BR><BR>We call for Joe. Nothing. We call once again. Finally Pete kicks his cot. Joe snaps angrily. \"I''m awake, I''m awake!\" We ask if he heard the shrill. He says he has been listening as well. <BR><BR>Needless to say I felt more comfortable with the situation this time. I knew I had survived the first night and chances of survival again are probably good. I''m not going to BS you though, I was still terrified. Maybe not to the extent that Pete and Joe were. We knew we had to go. The shrills were more prominent.<BR><BR>We urge Joe to get up but he replies in a cold dead fear \"I can''t move.\" I had really never seen anyone so scared. He really just could not moved. He was paralyzed from fear (to this day he won''t admit). We helped to motivate him.<BR><BR>There was no sign of a large two legged mammal this time. None of us planned on sticking around to test that theory. Pete grabbed the recorder. Once Joe managed to secure his feet in his boots we started our long trek out of the woods. When we were about twenty feet away from the camp, the horrendous shrills stopped...again. The only thing I take from this was, they just didn''t want us there, and once we were apparently leaving, they cut out the scare tactics. It worked.<BR><BR>When we got to the trail, I wondered what would have happened had I looked behind us. What would I have seen on that trail if I would have simply turned my head back into that direction? Would I have seen that massive creature staring us down, that I had seen the night before? I have nightmares to this day about this question.  I wish I would have looked back at that time, because it obviously wouldn''t have been as horrifying as the unknown. I thought the dreams would stop once I moved out of state, but I still have them.<BR><BR>So now my friends believed me. It was a real rush because I really wasn''t expecting it to happen twice in one life, much less two days. Pete and Joe both were walking very fast ahead of me and I tried to slow them down. I knew at this point the creatures was probably content with seeing us leave. Since we parked a car closer by this time, my exit was much quicker than the last night''s.<BR><BR>The next morning we awoke earlier that we should have. I think we maybe topped 2 hours sleep.  The fact is, we were eager to go see the site.<BR><BR>Being late teens meant high expectations. The mission was, collect all the evidence we could find on site. Then turn in the cassette tape with our solid proof of Sasquatch calls and collect a million dollars from top paying anthropologists and newspapers all over the world. Of course this is ridiculous, but at that age, it seemed a possibility. In fact is seems people are quicker to believe in making money with get rich overnight schemes than the existence of bigfoot.<BR><BR>We enter the woods treating it like a crime scene. The patch of pines looks just as we left it from a distance. No 3 inch deep massive foot prints, because the ground was incredibly dry. No patches of Yak type hair hanging from the trees. And no not even a huge nest where a tribe of Sasquatch decided to have a sleep over.<BR><BR>As we got closer we did find some very interesting details. The cooler was hanging open. It had been rummaged through. The hot dogs were untouched (does that tell you anything)?, and the chips were scattered all over the ground. Not at all how we left it. Mind you there was no alcohol or drugs on our camp out, because none of us touched the stuff on excursions. We were too GI Joe for that. We were very conscience campers as far as neatness and tidiness goes. We ran a tight camp.<BR><BR>A nifty little piece of evidence was the bread bag. We had two brand new bags  of bread and buns. None of us had any bread the night before. Neither of us had any bread with our dogs. The twisty tie still remained intact. There were no claw marks or reminisce of saliva. The bags had been simply pulled apart as if a human did it. Not a crumb left.<BR><BR>We had plenty of footage to rummage through. But we knew it wouldn''t be a good idea to play Sasquatch yells out in the middle of the woods, for fear we would call the tribe. Hey, we were nineteen and twenty years old!<BR><BR>So when we got back we started the player. To our immediate disliking was our apparent lack of knowledge with audio expertise, the sound was very distorted. In attempt to capture every single noise we cranked the volume as high as it would go when recording. All this did was gather the sound of the motors of the machine running most of all. <BR><BR>But there was sound! It was not a complete failure! Immediately the haunting shrills were apparent. I felt the hair raise on the back of my neck, reliving these moments in my mind. We heard ourselves leaving the campsite yapping like the scared kids we were. Our Sasquatch calls were captured. Now what to do?<BR><BR>Another surprise hit us about two weeks later. With several attempts to go on another camping excursion, all failed. I am not sure if it''s because we were all deep down still recuperating from our last Bigfoot adventure, or if we just were too laid back into our boring small town lives once again.<BR><BR>My mom called me at work and mentioned about a Bigfoot researcher being in town and he was on the six o clock news. She taped it on our old clunker Beta machine and I watched it when I got home.<BR><BR>Enter Robert Morgan, Anthropologist. Bigfoot hunter. It''s just what we needed. I immediately called the news channel and requested Robert Morgan''s phone number. <BR><BR>Soon after I was in touch with Morgan. He asked if I meet him at his office in the city of Canton. Apparently, there had been many sightings of Sasquatch in this area at this very time which is why he was there. This amazed me, I had no idea. He pointed out to me that there were in fact lots of sightings here and in PA. From that point on I heard stories all over from that area and in Columbiana County.<BR><BR>Morgan reviewed the tape & then had Pete and I fill out reports for him. Joe did not come. He was still pretty shaken up to even talk about it. In fact we have not discussed it until just recently.<BR><BR>The next step was revisiting the site.  I had ultimately realized I had done all the right things to avoid a confrontation with a Yeti. He combed the site, and between that and our description of what happened,  speculated that we had been involved in a territorial dispute with two or more young males. Us being the dispute. Apparently they liked the pine needle bedding more than we did, and the local water hole. What he said made sense.<BR><BR>Fourteen years later, the mystery is still there. What would have happened if I would have had the courage to stay? I don''t know or will I ever. I would be joking myself if I thought these days I would have stayed longer. When I close my eyes and imagine that night 11 years ago, the hair still stands on my back. The fear of the unknown always gets the best of me.<BR><BR>We had left Robert Morgan with our original sound recording. The next time I tried to call Morgan he had already left the state to do research elsewhere.  I know it wasn''t the best recording, but it was our only evidence of this encounter, and clear enough to hear. I was so excited when I heard the Columbiana County recordings because the sounds were so like ours. I recently got back in contact with Robert, and it was nice to hear he did remember us and our recordings. Morgan was extraordinarily helpful then, and even more so now.<BR><BR>That day was a special day for me. It showed me scientists aren''t the big dogs they make themselves out to be. If there was no mystery in life then it would be too predictable for everybody. It was a day that took a large chunk out of my ordinary life and threw me right into my own X-FILE. It was scary, exciting, mysterious, thrilling and suspenseful all rolled up into one.<BR><BR>The skeptic in me sometimes says, I just imagined all this. Like a mass hypnosis or something. It all seemed so real, but couldn''t have been. The rational side of me butts in and says, this really happened, no matter how unbelievable the situation was, and my friends were there to witness it. It was amazing, and I would invite it to happen anytime of day or night again. I love the mystery of it, and that there are so many opinions out there, but I know the real truth. It''s not a mystery to me at all anymore. Keeping themselves hidden so well that it lights a little flare of rich thought in all of us. These woods people have stayed hidden for as long as they need to be. They have to be really good at it to avoid all the people fighting to get footage with tripwire cameras and such.<BR><BR>I walked into those woods as the king, and walked out a far less than that. All out there that have experienced this can relate to the amount of vulnerability associated with this. What I seen and heard was not a Harry And The Hendersons! I didn''t get the chance to have smores with it. I''m not saying it was mean either, but damn persistent.<BR><BR>No closing comments here. Just a great experience into the unknown, that I can call my own. That''s enough for me.<BR><BR>",

    " The incident occurred on June 9, 2021 at approximately 5:15pm. It started raining around 3:30pm and ended around 5pm. I had to get the grass mowed because it was already too long. Usually, when I mow, I have my cellphone in my shirt pocket. But, since it rained, I didnt want to take the chance of it getting wet. So, I left it in the house. <BR><BR>I was mowing in the direction of north to south. There are several large farm fields behind my house. In between these properties are three large depressions in the landscape where a large vehicle could park in there and no one would see it. Through these particular spots are cart paths that run along the bottom (also running from north to south). As I was mowing, a dark figure appeared down by the corner of one of the fields, approximately150-200 yards out. I stopped and looked and was wondering if it was the neighbor checking his trail cam that points to the north. <BR><BR>I took my mower over to the wood pile which is approximately 35 yards closer, to get a better view. The field was just planted with soybeans, so I couldnt go in the field with the mower. At that point, the dark figure was just east of the trail cam and I was hoping it would cross the path of the trail cam, but it seemed to avoid that area. This dark figure was following the deer trail that are 40 yards east of the trail cam. I asked myself, What am I looking at? knowing it had just rained. Who would be back there? I idled the mower down and noticed the toadstools around the wood pile and thought maybe it was a mushroom hunter. But, this person was black from head to toe and mushroom season is basically over by now. <BR><BR>This large figure started to move across the second field heading northeast along where the deer usually go, down into the large depression in the field. As it was moving across the field, I knew there was no way I would have enough time to get my cell phone or binoculars in time to view it.  I sat there and observed it following the deer trail...knowing it was not a black bear walking on two legs. The whole time I was thinking, No one is going to believe me. <BR><BR>It seemed to cross the field without any trouble and cleared the field within a matter of a minute and a half. As it disappeared into the chest-high weeds, I sat there for approximately five minutes waiting to see if it would appear on the other side or head toward the large section of woods which have several trail cams along the perimeter of the woods. I also scanned the treeline for any vehicles that might be there from someone out walking, but there werent any. I could not figure out what I had just seen. I finished mowing and didnt even tell my wife about it until a few days later. <BR><BR>At my first opportunity, on June 12th we took our golf cart back into the area to see if we could find any prints or tracks. To our disappointment, the field had been no-tilled (Roundup) where the field was filled with weeds, grass, and corn stalks where it made it very hard to find footprints. We also followed the path that it took up to the large part of the depression in the field where you can see game trail going in and out of chest-high weeds. We also took the cart down into the lower part of the depression via the mowed paths that are back there. <BR><BR>On June 13th, we conducted a re-enactment with our 15 year-old son. He is about 511 and 235 lbs. We had him dress in a black Adidas sweatsuit that had white lettering and stripes on it. My wife took him on the golf cart to the area where I saw the black figure. I sat back at the wood pile on my mower to watch for him. Through cell phone conversations with my son, I had him put up his hood and walk the same path, three quarters of the way through the field, all in black. <BR><BR>My first observation was that what I saw on June 9th was much bigger and moved through the field easier than my son did. He was trying not to walk on the newly planted soybeans and trying to miss the old corn stalks in the field. Because of this it took my son longer to cross the field. He was close enough that I could actually see the white parts of my son''s sweat suit with no problem. Because of that, I know that what I saw was all black. <BR><BR>Note in May, we saw less deer in the area possibly due to the farmer tiling the field. And for the month of June, we have taken cart rides and have seen less deer in the area. <BR>I havent told too many people for fear of being made fun of. My wife didnt really believe me until we did the re-enactment. She even says that there is no way you could miss something all black from head to toe back there. I just cant seem shake it from my mind.",

    " It was several years ago, the date itself, I am not sure of. It was a dry summer, a very infamous drout if I remember. It wasn''t uncommon for deer, raccoons, and other animals of the country side to wander in towards the edge of town to drink from the creek or reservoirs. This one particular day, my father and I awoke early in the morning to leave for Fremont, it was barely light out, still dark. Birds were chirping and singly beautifully as they do in the morning dawn, but then suddenly we heard it From what seemed to come from the creek and reservoirs area was an eerie cry that sounded like a sick cow. This cry so primal and terrifying it made the hair on the back of both of our necks stand strait up with fear. Instantly the birds were mostly quiet, their singing replaced by the sound of every dog with in a mile radius, barking wildly at the top of its lungs. My father, a veteran hunter of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Ohio had never heard anything like this before in his life. We tried not to think about it and made sure all the doors on our house were locked before driving off to Fremont. Years later now, I am visiting your website and listening to sound clips of Bigfoot. And one made my heart stop, it was the exact same scream we heard so long ago.<BR>",

    "  It was June 18th, 2021 about 4:00 pm at Mohican State Park, Loudonville, Ohio in Ashland County. My best friend and Idrove into the picnic area at theCovered Bridge, and there were no campers, hikers, or people fishing, so we drove into Campsite B, its a narrow road that is parallel to the Mohican River. Then we reached the end of this road where there is a turn-around, so we parked the car and shut off the engine. The front of the car was facing towards the Covered Bridge and the Mohican River was on the driverside of the car, and the thick woods were on the passenger''s (my side) and to the rear of us. Also, itwas an unusually chilly day forthe month of June and it was verycloudy, with no sun and a slight drizzle of rain. So, we sat in the car with the windows down, we could hear birds chirping and the soft babbling sounds of the river. We sat there for about 30 minutes, talking away as women do and I mentioned that I watched a Bigfoot show on tv and we should do \"bigfoot calls\". So, jokingly I started doing whoop whoop calls and it echoed in this small area, we laughed for a couple of minutes then took a drink of our pop and we heard two tree knocks,not loud but not soft. Instantly, I was scared because the sound was very close to us, it was about 30 feet up in the thick woods, and it was very steep, almost straight-up. I knew this was not a person because it''s too dangerous to climb. This spooked both of us so we started the car and went back to the Covered Bridge picnic area which is more of an open area. Also, there were a few cars so we did not feel alone, and my friend had to use the restroom and I stayed in the car. The woods were still on my right side and I could hear birds chirping loud and fast then all of a sudden they stopped. Then a rock that was about 6 inches wide came tumbling down on the ground of this steep cliff along with dry leaves falling behind it.So I looked up and about 15-20 feet away I saw the left side of a foot, calf, thigh, and hip of an animal. It looked like it was slipping on the leaves and was trying to gain traction and its leg went straight up and behind a tree. This leg looked like a bodybuilder''s leg with short black hair and was about 3-4 feet in length. Then my friend got into the driver''s side of the car and we left. So,when I got home I looked up videos on youtube of bears. My leg sighting does not match a bear leg because the hind leg of a bear or dog has an odd angle from the pad of the foot to its leg. Butwhat I saw was a human-likefoot with hair that connected to a calf, to a knee, to a thigh then to a hip,and it was super muscular. Also, there have been NO bear sightings in Mohican State Park for many decades.",

    " This incedent took place in the mid to end of summer of 1999.  We were in the woods south of town in the hopes to find the plant \"gensing\".  The timber in the area is very old with dense undergrouth.  Now before I continue the story I have a few other things to let you know about this area.<BR><BR>  There are stories of coon hunters hearing this sound and having there dogs come running back to them with their tales tucked.  They say that what ever it is, it is not anything they have ever heard.<BR><BR>  All of the things I am telling you are very true.  They have all happened within 5-10 miles of each other.<BR><BR>  back to my Dad and I.  We were walking through the woods when this very loud, sort ofrumbley growling howl.  I dont know but I have spent many many hours in the woods and have never ever heard a sound like this.  When we heard this sound all of my hair stood up on the back of my kneck.  I turned to my father and with fright said,  \"what was that\".  With his eyes enlarged he replyed,  \"i dont know\".  Needless to say that had ended our hunt for genseng.  On our way out of the woods we heard the same sound three times.  It was almost like the sound was that of letting us know we were too close to what ever it was.<BR><BR>  Now listen to this.  Believe it or not the next summer my dad had returned to the same stretch of woods about 2 miles from the previous year.  Again he was hunting for genseng and goldenseal.  He had come home early from his hunt which is not usual.  When he came home I had asked him if he had found anything and he said, \"no but I saw something that shouldnt have been there\".  He said that he was walking through the hills and had to cross the creek bottom.  There in the creek bottom was a footprint.  He said that he looked at it for a minute and then said to himself, \"there shouldnt be anyone out here in bare feet\".  the closest house is about a half a mile from where he said that he was.  Needless to say that was the last time that we have ever went to those woods.  Ocassionaly we walk the railroad tracks that run adjacent to the milesw of woods that run that creek bottom.  Every time we are in the area we get this fealling that something is watching us.  You know what I am talking about.  All the hair stands up on your kneck and you get the fealing that that you are not welcome there at the time.  Wtihout ignoring this feeling we just turn and walk away.<BR><BR>I hope I am interesting you because I really believe \"bigfoot\" to be real.  <BR><BR>  Now here is why I strongly believe on top of all these things I have told you about.  <BR><BR>  My brother was driving down the road at a late hour of the night.  He was driving down the raod with two girls in the car, lucky him.  The same roud that runs north and south of the sight were my father seen the footprint.  As he came to crest of a small hill he said that he ahd seen this set of redish looking eyes.  To the right side of the road is a corn field that boarders the woods.  Mind you the corn is at full growth.  As he got closer to the eyes he said that what ever it was stood up and was at least one foot above the corn.  The two girls turned and emediately started crying in fear of what they had just seen.  He said that she just kept telling Justin, mybrother, to take her home, take me home now is what she told him.  Justin said that as they approached the eyes they stood above the corn.  In aww he stoped the car a faced the headlights at the creature.  He said that the animal turned and looked back at them for about three seconds.  he described the animal as being fury and having a greyish light colored \"V\" shape of hair down its chest.  He said that as it turned he was amazed by the size of the creature.  To this day one of the girls that was with im will NOT talk about what she seen that night.  The other girl will slap you if you even bring it up because it scares her soo bad.  My brother still has not hunted or fished that area scince he has seen that creature.<BR><BR>  Three years later my mom was on her way to work.  It was early morning, just light enough to see without headlights.  When she crossed the bridge, the same bridge that crosses the tracks that run down these woods, she said that she saw this very large man lookinmg hairy thing walking down the railroad tracks.  She said that what ever it was, it was not human.  She said that it had to be atleast 8 feet tall and very hairy.  She said that she thought about turning around to see just what the heck this thing was but she could not build up the courage.<BR><BR>  I really do know with out any doubt that bigfoot is real.  The type of cover that i have seen on the internet that people have described as bigfoot teritory is the ide4al cover around these sightings.  I hope you take my stories serious and i would like to know if you fallow up on the study of these in the area.  <BR><BR>               ",

    " Early Fri. morning, Sept. 18,2015, 3:00AM. My wife and I were camping at Mohican State Park in east central Ohio. We were camping in our van. My wife went to bed at about 10:30PM, I turned in about 1:30AM. I had to leave the van to relieve myself. I opened the van''s side door. I have the interior lights set not to come on when the doors are opened. I glanced around outside, as I always do, and stepped out of the van. The center of the road, running through the camping area is about 25 to 30 ft. from where I was standing. On my side of the road there are individual campsites bordering the road, on the other side of the road is the Mohican River. My dying campfire cast a faint glow, the slightly overcast sky provided separation from the skyline and the tree line in the immediate area.<BR>Out of the corner of my eyes I detected a slight movement on the road but everything was bathed in shadow from the trees. I felt I was seeing a shadow of something. I leaned forward peering into the darkness for a better look. The shadowed form booted toward the entrance of the camp area. All I could see was its silhouette. It was upright and moving on two feet. It stood at least 8ft high. I watched in disbelief as it covered about 50ft distance with what seemed like 5 or 6 strides and disappeared into the darkness. I did notice that it had a slender appearance. I knew at once it was a Bigfoot. I had heard of other sightings in the area. I stood there, still in disbelief, running through my mind what I had just seen. I questioned everything else it could have been. Nothing else fit. My mind finally told me, \"Robert, you know what you saw. A Bigfoot.\"",

    " Around 3am I walked outside my parents'' home with my Great Dane puppy and through the front gate to my car. As I was walking I heard the neighbors'' two German Shepherds barking furiously at something in front of their home in New Lebanon. Their dogs bark at anyone walking by, but I could tell their barking was more serious sounding this time. I stared through the darkness and noticed a silhouette of something huge. My first thought was that maybe a loose horse? Then it came a little farther South on Clayton Rd. and I could clearly see a huge and thick human like shaped silhouette against the other lights from houses. I thought to myself \"Man that is a really big guy and he is running super fast!\"<BR>Then I started to think that a normal human man of that size could no way run that fast, then I thought well I''ve never seen a man that big! Just as my puppy spotted this creature still running South on S. Clayton Rd. about 15 feet from Mile Rd. he started to let out a bark. I stopped him as I was now in intense fear since I was beginning to realize I was standing alone out doors with a huge creature! We then ran back into my parents home and I locked the door behind me. My mother and father came out into their living area and asked me what was I doing and what was going on? I explained. This man like creature that I now refer to as a Bigfoot that from my short distance away to be about 7-8 foot tall and running full speed at about 35mph.<BR>My father quickly got his guns and went out into the front yard near my car. A few minutes later after I settled down I followed him. I showed him wear I spotted the Bigfoot and where it had came running from and where I had last seen it. Nearly 40 minutes later my father was still outside looking around and listening to the sounds. Right before I went to leave for the second time around 3:40am my father also claims to have seen a similar creature on two legs where I had last seen it before I came running into their home. He said it was just as I had described it, but it was walking very slowly.<BR>There are a lot of open fields and small creeks in our area. I''m not sure a Bigfoot really has the room it might need to survive out here, but I could be wrong. All I can say is that I know it was not a farm animal on the loose and it was too tall and thick to be a man. The head was very large along with its wide thick shoulders. The head and neck was like one thick part as it went down to the shoulders. As it was running I could see the shoulders moving with the upper body. It was like a giant 8 foot ape running down the road on two legs. ",

    " Since this spring my family  noticed several unusual things in our area. First was a very strange set of 3-hoofed or 3-toed prints that we found and my 10 yr.old daughter followed with her feet down a path and into the woods coming away from a large lake people fish at alot. It is located in a nature reserve area right next to my home here in Huber Heights, Ohio. Friday, Labor Day weekend, I took my children to a secluded place on the Miami River in Tipp City, Ohio. We were just going to play in a very shallow area and mess in the river.I was with my 10 yr. old daughter and my son who is 6, and their friend (male) who is 10 also. I knew something was weird when we first went down the path to the river because it was so dead quiet. You could hear your voice echo and nothing else. No Crikets or birds or bugs. Was very eary! None the less we found a path that led right to the river. We stood there and besides this tree with a bunch a sticks laying under it. The kids picked up large sticks and began hitting the tree with them. We then turned to leave the area and try to get closer to the rocks we wanted to get to. As I left, my 10 yr.old saw across the river a set of bushes and a tree shake like something hit it. It spooked her and she ran up ahead of me. The kids then found a pond further down the path and were throwing rocks in it, when I decided to walk back towards the car. I still was not feeling comfortable at all about the silence.I then heard out of this silence, a very loud chirping-whistle coming from somewhere so I stopped and turned to face the river. I heard the whistle first to my left,then immediatly to my right. Then it seemed to travel away to the right and get fainter.For some reason, Im not sure why, but I whistled at it. It then whistled back and when it did, it changed its tone and went down an octive. ( I have studied music my whole life and I couldn''t hit its tone or pitch.)But it answered me back really scaring me. I called for the kids to come over by me and I then told them I thought it was time to go. I stopped and asked if they heard that chirping which seemed to be moving off down stream to my right still. I said to them \"listen I''ll whistle and then it will answere me back.\" I whistled again and instead of the sound I thought it would make, It began to chirp on our side of the river it seemed. The sound kept getting louder and louder. Moving closer to us when all of a sudden, we heard this enourmous tree being literally pushed to the ground to our right.Right infront of us! I screamed \" RUN!\" We all turned and ran, but my 6 yr. old didn''t run. My oldest daughter said she looked over her shoulder to see where he was when we were running. She noticed he wasn''t with us and he was standing frozen with his fists clutched to his sides.His eyes were really big and he looked so scared.She then yelled at him and he turned and ran.I only noticed him not being with us  we all were in the van with the doors shut, car started, and he was then on the outside screaming to get in. In those seconds he didn''t run, this is what he said he saw:<BR>          He told me that when the tree fell, something caught his eye so he turned to look.(to the right)He said it walked out of the woods and turned on the path looking straight at him. It took 3 steps stopped, and tilted its head to the side. It then took 4 more steps, paused and began moving even closer to him. It was then that he heard us yelling. He swears that he NEVER heard me scream run and he never heard us screaming and running to the car.He said that it was about as tall as his sister who is ten. It had a very large head that was round but it was sorta pointed on top. It was completly covered with brown fur or hair even the face had hair on it.Its eyes he couldn''t see until it was closer and then he said they were round and black. His nose was black and sqwished to its face. Almost flat like.Its mouth was very wide, big, and looked like it was frowning. ( Or sad as he put it) It had very long arms that hung passed his knees  and swung out very far in front and back as it walked.It was hunched over when it walked too. Big shoulders and  a \"VERY\" big chest. He said when it got really close to him he then smelled it and it smelled like rotted garbage form the garage(haha)He even said he noticed clumps of mud hanging from its arms on the fur or hair. It never growled or made a sound. It just kept walking towards him and looking at him.<BR>   He has been in serious distress at times since then. Fear, saddness, and anger are the bigger ones. He felt as though it was sad because of the face. Anger, because for a day and half we wouldn''t listen to his story. He kept trying to tell us all somehing but we wouldn''t listen. Fear, because it was incredibly scary to be standing alone and seeing this walk to you. I have had contacted our pediatrician and he is checking up on him and has been great in believing our story. We contacted someone who had a simular experience with his family in Oregon, and he has talked with my son and has helped us in dealing with all the anxiety in this whole situation and has be-friended him as well. We have made this a positive thing for him saying \"How many people actually see a bigfoot! What a cool kid you are!\" Plus allowing him to express how he has been feeling about this whole thing. He is excited about it, then very reserved about it too.  He also picked up a strange stick which I''m sending off to be evaluated. It looks as though something has used it for something. It was sanded down smooth by something and has tan and black animal hair fibers in certain parts of the wood.<BR> Something exists and we heard but our hero, Brian saw it!",

    " On June 20, 2004, at 2 AM, I was lounging in my recliner watching TV. I noticed something like a large dark shadow looking in my window. We have four full length windows with no curtains because our family room faces the woods. I had no lights on other than the TV and my fish aquarium. The moon was slightly giving some light but not enough do make out any features. At first, I thought I was just imagining this. Slowly, I turned off the TV. When I did, the shadow moved over. I thought it was my imagination so I covered my head a went to sleep in my recliner. The next morning at 6 AM, I was still unnerved. When I looked toward the window, there was two large hand prints on the glass about 12 inches long. My brother wears a size 14 ring and these fingers were about four inches longer than his hand. It looked like a very large mans hand with fingers spread apart. I am retired from a Police Department and worked in fingerprinting and latent examination. I called my two brothers to come to my house and went into the bedroom to wake up my husband. I trembled in fear for about an hour afterwards. This thing had to be at least eight to nine feet tall to be standing where it was. I showed the handprints to my entire family. I did not want to report this because I am a foster parent and I was afraid people would think I''m crazy. On July 20, 2004, my dogs were screaming wildly. That night, my brother had stayed over since he was sick and was sleeping in the spare bedroom. At 4 AM, something was beating on the walls of my house so hard it knocked items off a shelf over the bed and dislodged my vinyl siding. This was new siding just installed in the spring! Needless to say, we were up all night. I was talking to my brother a few nights later at around 1 AM when I noticed another set of handprints on the window. Being a trained fingerprint technician they appeared to be not human and showed very little or no detail at all. The next day, we decided to clean these prints off our windows. We figured whatever left them would be back and leave some more. We used pure vinegar to clean the prints. Whatever was on its hands did not want to come off! It took some serious scrubbing to finally remove them. Other than the handprints, my windows were actually very clean. I have lived here for four years. My foster daughters told us twice that they were seeing a big man around our 1.5 acre pond. I didn''t believe it was anything like this! We live in the country. Ever since we bought a large dog kennel to keep the dogs from running around this thing is getting brave enough to look into our windows and hit the house. I am convinced that something is outside my house. We live very close to Zaleski State Forest. We will be setting up my brother in laws wildlife camera hoping to catch this thing on film. I will let you know if and when we get a picture. ",

There''s an area close to Peach Orchard, near Boy Scout camp...a friend I met several years later had an even scarier encounter on the other side of that ridge...the unknown chased him and a car load of friends..because of that incident, I began my own investigation and came up with some interesting theories about what is in our woods here...and discovered it is not as big a secret as I thought.",

    " My then girlfriend, and eventual ex wife were bowling in a mixed bowling league that ended around 7 PM. We chatted with some teammates and friends for a few moments then left. I had two beers during the three games, along with several cans of pop. Melody was in a mood and she wanted to go out to the forest and relax. We stopped by the local Jim Dandy and picked up two specials, (a burger and very small drink) and headed to the Shawnee Forest. I suggested Picnic Point and that is where we went. Our car was a VW bug that she drove. I had finished my burger and drink and she gave me her drink, she drank like a bird, and never finished anything. We got to the point, drove around the circle so the car was pointing back out the way we came. We got out of the car, I placed the drink on the roof of the passenger side, while she was getting the blanket I trotted over to a nice tree, just over the lip of the hill to release some of the liquids I had consumed. I had just began to relieve myself when it started. I had commented as we got out of the car how quiet it was, no birds, no sounds of any kind. As I began to do my thing there were three loud crashes, down the hill in front of me, coming straight up. Now, these crashes, were strides, you could tell something big and heavy was striding up the hillside. The strides stopped, I looked up, Melody asked if I heard that, I nodded and put my free finger to my lips, indicating quiet, I was trying to fix the exact location. Then several more strides and it stopped again. Ok, I was zipped and ready to move and slowly backing towards the car, eyes fixed on the direction of the sound. Mel asked me if I had any idea what that was, as I said, the sounds were obviously strides, not a deer crashing through the brush. I answered I did not know. Then there was a low sound, almost like a growl, and what ever it was, it was coming up the hill now, very hard and very fast. We both said \"let''s get the hell out of here.\" As we jumped in the car, I, out of habit, grabbed the cup off the roof and placed it between my legs. Let pause the narration for a moment, for a personal description. I am a very curious fellow, I am not one to turn tail and run...that part of my nature took hold for a second and I suggested since we were in the car, let''s wait and see what pops up over the hillside...Melody would have none of that..she was driving and we were leaving, period. As I looked at her to argue the point, there was a thump on the car, she had already started it, she popped the clutch and the car lurched. There was a flash of something that went by my window, she screamed, I told her to drive it was just my cup falling off the roof...yes, the same cup I secured between my legs. We sped back into town and went to the local Moose Lodge where I was a member. There were several reasons, one, I wlll try to explain later, I was shaking uncontrollably...two we had friends there, and three they had the best set of floodlights in the city, I wanted to see the car. We got to the lodge, I got out and looked at the car. The car was very dusty and dirty. On the top of the car was an enormous hand print, very obvious it was a hand, fingers, not claws. One the right rear side quarter panel was another hand print. Whatever it was had been looking in that small window that all Beetles had. On the door on my side, in the dust, you can see where fingers had slid down the side. The only thing I could think of was is reached for the door as we lurched away, that was the flash and the second thump. Several friends saw this, we went back out later that night, but were turned away by the Rangers, forest closed after dark.<BR><BR>Far and away the scariest part of all this..when we were in the car and heard the first thump, I turned in my seat and looked in the direction of that thump, that meant I looked out that little window...I must have looked it straight in the eyes. I say must because I don''t remember, I remember turning to look, turning back and urging her to drive, but I cannot tell you what I saw that night. It just happened so quickly! I have not had a good night sleep since...I used to be at home in the woods, and I still have fun, until the sun begins to go down, or I get \"a feeling.\"",

    " My encounter was back in 1982. A friend and I were visiting a neighbor lady and were leaving to go home around 10pm. <BR><BR>We had ridden our bikes there. We were pushing the bikes up the steep driveway to the main road when we seen a huge sihouette walk across the driveway opening at the main road. We had both seen it and said, \"Did you see that?\" <BR><BR>It walked back the other direction, crossing the driveway entrance again. I said, \"There it goes again! What the heck was that?\" <BR><BR>It reappeared and stopped at the top of the driveway and was looking directly at us. I said, \"There it is!\", and it grunted at us. We were scared. We dropped our bikes and ran back to the lady''s house as fast as we could.. <BR><BR>We told her what we saw. She laughed and grabbed a flash light and took us outside. We really did not want to go back out, but we trusted her. <BR><BR>We walked back up the driveway with the lady shinning the flash light everywhere. Nothing. Our bikes still laying where we had seen it.  We picked up our bikes. She walked us to the top of the driveway and shined the flashlight in both directions on the road. We took off riding as fast as we could to get home, about a mile away.<BR><BR>We told our parents. And, of course, they said it was a deer or a bear mating or something ...

    " I went fishing in Morgan Monroe State Forest with my two sons and our beagle. About mid day we heard something BIG in the woods near where we were fishing, way bigger than a deer running through the woods, in fact it was like a large crashing sound and about 30 seconds later there came the sound of a tree breaking. I suppose it''s quite possible that an old rotten tree was in the process of falling down, and it didn''t really scare us although it was odd. What happened for the next few hours was however beyond odd, it was downright spooky. <BR>For those who aren''t familiar with Prather Lake, it''s in a very remote part of Morgan Monroe and it''s quite a hike to reach the lake when the access road is closed. When you get there you know that it is rarely visited, maybe due to the extremely rugged terrain or the long walk that it takes to get back there even when the road is open it''s still quite a hike down a long downhill trail to reach the lake. <BR>Back to my experience, after hearing the noises coming from the woods nearby the lake my sons and I moved to another spot to fish. <BR>Not an easy feat when you''re carting fishing gear and a stringer of fish because like I said, the terrain is rugged and steep. We moved to a place in about the middle of the lake and begin to fish again, this location was approximately the direct opposite side of the lake from where we heard the crash and tree breaking sounds. For the next few hours that we were fishing we heard sounds like someone banging on a tree with a tree branch. I guess in the world of Bigfoot research that''s called knocking. The knocking seemed to be somewhat rhythmic in the sense that it was two or three big knocks followed by 10 or 15 minutes of silence. Our beagle was busy sniffing around all day long, like we''d never seen her sniff before, her level of excitement was through the roof! What was unusual about her behavior was that she was reluctant to leave our sight. She didn''t venture out more than 20 or 30 yards from us until about the time we decided to leave. Anyone who owns a beagle knows that they love to sniff and love to stray away on the trail of what ever they are sniffing out and our dog is no exception. This day she didn''t, and she seemed scared out of her wits. <BR>We were getting tired of fishing and were talking about leaving because we had about a hours walk ahead of us to get back to the car. We decided to finish out fishing because we only had about five night crawlers left and it seemed to be a waste to toss them. Our dog finally mustered the courage to venture out of our sight. She did so meandering up the mossy covered hill that we were at the bottom of and she was gone for about 15 minutes. We heard her rustling through the leaves and forest foliage and then she would get quite for a minute or two. I didn''t think too much of it at the time until she let out a series of barks and whines that sounded more like she was in trouble than if she were on a trail. This got our attention and we looked in the direction of her calls, we heard her high-tailing it through the woods and she appeared racing down the hill in our direction. She raced toward me with her tail between her legs and nearly tripped me trying to hide behind me. We got a good laugh out of that figuring she probably got into it with some forest animal and it got the best of her. That''s when we heard the knocking again- behind us in the same area that the dog had just returned from! We also noticed an extreme smell, like crap in the air. The dog began to bark and get super excited while looking up the hill behind us. She started to run up the hill again, but stopped short only about 10 feet from us and again raced back behind me and looking up the hill. Then we heard the knocking again. I decided it was time to go, my sons who are age 9 and 10 began to get spooked by all this excitement and honestly, so was I! <BR>All day long I had made up excuses for the weird noises we heard because I didn''t want to say bigfoot or sasquatch around them and make them afraid to go into the forest. But things were beginning to get all too strange so we quickly packed up our gear, grabbed our fish (fought off the huge snapping turtle that was trying to steal the fish off of our stringer) and got the heck out of there. On the way back up the steep hill that lead back to the fire trail my oldest son said to me, \"Dad, do you think that Daisy (our dog) saw a big foot?\" <BR>Not actually seeing anything myself, all I could tell him is, \"mmmm, maybe?\" ",

    " This happened at Oubache State Park near Bluffton Indiana either the summer of 1989 or 1990. I was working as a night watchman at the front gate and had been watching television when I decided that I needed to get something out of my Ford Bronco. The area leading up to the park is heavily forested with trees that had been planted by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Depression. The road leading into the park was about a third of a mile long. As I stepped outside the booth and was crossing the road to the parking lot, I heard the most terrifying scream that I have ever heard in my life about 250 yards to the southwest of my location. At the same time that I heard the scream I also heard a tree snap and break and fall to the ground. The tree sounded to be quite large. The weather that night was very calm and there was no wind at all which could account for this tree falling down. I quickly turned around and headed back for my booth and sat down to think about what just happened. I felt like I was in a daze for a few minutes as I was trying to think what a logical explaination of this event could be. I sat there for about 45 minutes and after I had settled down a bit, I decided that it must have been my imagination playing tricks on me and I proceeded to head back out to my truck. I was walking toward my truck and had gotten to the exact same spot that I was in previously when I heard the horrible scream when I heard it once again and this time it was about 50 yards away from my booth. I once again quickly retreated to my booth and sat there until daylight. Once day light arrived I walked out in the woods to investigate but found nothing out of the ordinary. I didn''t walk far enough out to find the tree as I was still quite unsettled by what I heard. I have heard screech owls and bobcats but nothing, absoultely nothing, that compares to the sound that I heard that night. I can''t say to this day what it might have been, but this has bothered me for about 16 years and I still think of it evey now and then. Reading about some of the other sighitngs that people have heard and the sounds that they said this creature made makes me think of my own experience and I wonder if I too actually had an encounter.",

    " My wife and I were night fishing for catfish on a Wednesday night on the Salamonie Reservoir when our occurrence happened. We were in a boat, at a remote part of the reservoir not accessible by vehicle or foot.  The nearest road is over 1 mile away.  <BR><BR>There was no one else at the boat dock when we put in, and I saw no other boat or boat lights on as we motored to are fishing spot.  We were sitting there fishing for about 3 hours. It was roughly 3-4 a.m. and we were sitting roughly 30-40 feet from shore.  All of the sudden there was something thrown at us from shore, something very large and heavy.  The object thrown at us had to have weighed in the neighborhood of 30-60 lbs. by the splash it made in the water about 10 feet from the boat.<BR><BR>I instantly grabbed the 5 million power spotlight and lit up the area on shore. There was nothing.  We sat there for about 5 minutes with the light on shore discussing what had just happened. We then decided no human couldn''t have possibly been there being so remote, nor threw something that heavy that far.  The splash actually made waves enough in the water to move the boat. I then started the boat and made fast tracks for the boat ramp.<BR><BR> I first thought it might have been just kids messing around, but, like I said, nothing moved near shore for 5 minutes. I had the whole shore line illuminated, and the object, probably a rock from shore, was very, very heavy by the splash.",

    " My friend, his younger brother, my younger brother and I were camping about 100yds behind my friends home.  It was either July, or August 1982. Over a few years I had spent several nights camping there with my friend.  His mother had been our Den Mother.  I was about 13 years old at the time of the encounter. <BR><BR>Our camp which was really only a barren spot in the trees behind the house that sits on  top of a hill whose contours followed a U in a stream that empties into Logan Creek and eventually the Ohio River about 12 miles down-stream.  The area is typical of the region; rolling hills, and a patchwork of farms and woods.<BR><BR>During the day we were approached by something making a call that was sort of bird-like and a little screechy chimp-like. The calls came in threes.  eeeehh.eeeEEEHHHH.wEEEEEEEAAAAAGH. The calls volume would build to the end.  Its sort of hard to describe. As it made this noise we could also hear it coming up from the creek.  As it moved closer the calls became louder, and more frequent.  It was such a ridiculous sound that at one point I remember looking, at my brother after a particularly loud colorful call and we were both chuckling.  The call made me feel like it was saying come on you have to be able to hear me now.  I dont know why, but thats how I felt.  It was obviously trying to get our attention.<BR><BR>When my friends brother said he thought it was a peacock my friend responded with, Uh-uh as in no.  I looked at my friend because he sounded funny and when saw his face he was slack-jawed with a bewildered look on his face.  He then said, Somethings moving around down there.  Which was sort of a funny thing to say; we were all very aware that something had been moving around for minutes.  I had the impression he had just seen something.  I suggested we go and see  it, and he said, Uh-uh, and shook his head slightly from side to side with that funny look on his face.  <BR><BR>The sound continued for about 5 minutes, or more.  I remember being surprised by its persistence. The other two brothers began to argue about going down to see it.  The younger kid wanted to see a peacock and my friend didnt want anything to do with it.  It was during their argument that the sounds went away.<BR><BR>The sound was not frightening to me. They were loud and intense and came to within about 30 or 40 yards but did not at any point seem to be a threat.  That said I was reluctant to take any initiative, on the lets go check this out front.<BR><BR>That evening we had to birds whistle to each other across our camp for what was probably an hour.  Not significant in its self, but later that night, when we had gone to bed, and with most of us asleep something else happened.  <BR><BR>In the morning my brother took me aside and asked about my friends dad.  He wanted to know how often the father came out to check-up on the boys camping.  I told him that to my knowledge never.  As a matter of fact, in the years that I knew my friend I had only met his father once and he had never been out to check on us times we had camped there.  My brother told me someone had walked up to our camp once everyone else  was asleep.  He was sure it was a big person because they stood at the edge of our camp breathing very heavily.  He was hoping it was my friends father, but was confused as to why he had come from the creek side of the camp, and not the house side.<BR><BR>The funny thing is we never talked about any of it after.  My brother and I have talked about it, but he doesnt remember the day time vocalization so much as the night time visitation. It still makes me laugh to think of him lying there scared stiff.  I can''t prove and can only speculate what happened that day. I think a bf approached us because we were some kids screwing around in the woods and not a threat.  I think it returned that night to check us out again.  I am to this day extremely disappointed we didnt check It out.<BR>",

    " It was last summer July 1998. I was sleeping when I heard a loud screaming sound I got up to see what it was. I went to my back door and looked out the back  door and I didn''t see anything. But I kept hearing this loud scream. So I turned on the light and it stopped. I looked around and didn''t see anything. So I went back to bed. Then a few months later I was watching sightings and they played a sound track of a Bigfoot I almost fell out of my chair it was the same scream I had heard in July.  I have moved from that house and live closer to the river Ohio river. But every time I hear that scream IT SENDS CHILLS UP AND DOWN MY BACK . <BR><BR>Thanks  <BR>",

    " I  have been reluctant to beleive what my mother says because she has always been a little squirrley, it runs in her family, but she told me several years back that my uncle was outside one night drunk as usual, another reason i was reluctant to believe her, but the story goes that something big and hairy got after him and he crawled up under the pickup truck to keep it from getting him. They live in southern Indiana in a remote area. They own about 60 acres that was my grandmothers. The area is rolling hills some big enough to be considered mountains. It lies northwest of Louisville, KY and east of Paoli Peaks, IN, a fairly well known ski resort town. I often wondered about the things they say they have seen and heard in the woods. They live about 3/4 of a mile back off the road in a trailer in the middle of a thick woods with alot of tall cedar and pine trees oaks and walnut trees also. the woods is heavy with alot of undergrowth and alot of sink holes and caves. Houses are spaced out in the area with alot of other heavily wooded properties joining theirs. Years ago my grandmother didn''t know what to call it but she reported to us of being chased back the lane by 2 adults - a larger adult and a smaller adult and 2 young ones. My siblings have heard howls but not really seen anything. My brother was killed in an automobile accident on Memorial day and we went up to help them make funeral arrangements on May 30th 06. I was on my way to the truck, it was probably between 11pm and midnight, my kids and husband were already in the truck we all had colds and my son was caughing so he my daughter and my husband did not hear it. It was a howl that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. I am a country girl, I''ve heard a coyote, dog and wolf howel before and this wasn''t any of those. I listened to the howls on your website and that is exactly what I heard only this one was alittle higher pitched like it may have been a younger one. My husband said all he could hear was my son coughing, I didn''t want to be the only one who heard it. I told my sister the next day and she said yes I''ve heard it many times before. You don''t have to prove to me that they exist I just want to know if that is what is in their woods. I am concerned for my parents safety. They are both dissabled and don''t need to be back there alone but they are too stubborn to sell it and get closer to town and when they are gone that land will go to us and I don''t intend on sharing it with \"Old Hairy.\" He''s gonna have to pack his family and move on. I''d like to have proof to show the world that yes, they do exist. [Edited]",

    " I am a 40 year old engineer and have been passively interested in Bigfoot since I was a kid.  I never gave it much serious thought until two or three years ago a strange animal was sighted near Bloomfield, IN were my Sister lives.  This event re-ignited my interest and I began doing a little research on the subject and ran across your website.<BR><BR>Since then a co-worker John (not his real name) told me about an experience he and his wife and son had last summer on a 600 acre farm along Blue River in southern Indiana near Fredericksburg. The farm belongs to the C.E.O. of our company. He uses it for recreation only.  There is a house on the property but no one lives there. Over the past few years he has some problems with the folks who used to own the property and one of the neighbors stealing things and tearing stuff up.  <BR><BR> My friend/co-worker is not at all interested in cryptozology or Bigfoot and would not take the time to write this report, therefore, with his permission I am submitting this report to you on his behalf. <BR><BR>By June, we were all stressed out trying to finish our project on time. John (my co-worker) said he took his wife and 12 year old son out on 4 wheelers, to the boss''s farm for some fishing and stress relief.  I ask him how the fishing was and he said \"We didn''t catch a thing, but I think that crazy drug fiend was back their messing with us\"! <BR><BR>\"What do you mean\", I ask.  <BR><BR>\"We were fishing in the river and right after it got dark somebody kept throwing BIG rocks or something in the water where we were fishing trying to scare us off. I think it was that nut that used to live on the property or the crazy neighbor\" he continued, \"I just couldn''t get a look at him\".  He was adamant about how big of a splash it was making and went on and on. <BR><BR>I was intrigued and said, \"Tell me the whole story from the beginning\". <BR><BR>This is how he related the facts to me about what happened to him, his wife and son.<BR><BR>They drove the truck to the back of the property, unloaded the 4 wheelers and drove down the hill into the dry stream bed and followed it to where it intersects with Blue River. They arrived about 8:00 p.m. They were set up in the mouth of the dry stream bed where it dumps into Blue River. They had a lit a Coleman lantern as it became dark about 8:50 p.m. It had been dark for almost an hour when they heard a huge splash in the water about 150-200 feet up stream (to their left). <BR><BR>His son asked \"What was that?\"<BR><BR>It was a big splash. He explained to his son that it was probably just a limb broke off and fell in the water.  They continued fishing, talking, and relaxing.  After a minuet or so there was another big splash in the water.  This time it was a little bit closer. <BR><BR>He described the sound of what ever was hitting the water as large enough to make a huge splash and then rain water droplets for two or three seconds afterward. It was loud enough to be heard over a 100 feet away in a running stream of water. He said it sounded like something the size of a bowling ball, or a heavy log; say 8 inches in diameter and 20 inches long, or a similar large heavy object hitting the water with great downward force. <BR><BR>So by now he''s kind of wondering what''s going on here? He can''t see anything beyond the circle of light projected from the lantern so he goes to the 4-wheeler to retrieve an ultra high intensity portable search light. Just then splash! A third time still closer, he shines the light around and doesn''t see anything. The brush around the creek bank is pretty dense. They are standing a dry feeder stream basin about eye level to the ground on the surrounding banks so it is extremely difficult to see very far.  His son is kind of scared now.  John starts talking out loud \"Alright, I guess I''m going to have to get my gun out now\", as he rattles around in the tackle box. Splash! Just then a fourth object hits the water yet closer to them, still upstream a little. Again all of these objects, though never seen, are appearently 10-20 lb. hitting the surface displacing a large spray of water. <BR><BR>My friend is mad now. He''s shining the light around, turning it off and on trying to pick up any movement, looking for any anything that will indicate who is doing this and where they are.  He shouts out loud, \"Come on out where I can see to shoot\".  All of this is a bluff of course, as he doesn'' t really have a gun at all.  So then he turns the light off and listens. A minuet or two passes then Splash! This time he is ready with the light and sees the spray of water from the impact about 30-40 feet away. At this point his son is pretty scared and ready to leave.  <BR><BR>He keeps trying to determine where the objects are coming from.  He can not tell if whoever is throwing them is on the opposite bank or on his side further upstream to the left. He said he feels like they were coming from the opposite bank, but he never saw anything to confirm or deny this notion. The opposite bank is a steep hillside that goes up a hundred feet or more at an angle of about 80 degrees. Their side is relatively flat with an open meadow and tree line along the bank to their left and dense woods to the right.    <BR><BR>By now his son was very scared and they have decided to pack up and leave. As they gathered their gear, Splash! something hits the water again about 20 feet away! Finally just as everything was ready to go, Splash! something big hit the water so close the water spray hit the bank where they had been standing a few seconds earlier. <BR><BR>John said this time he saw the column of water spray shoot up into the air about 20 feet. He indicated there did not seem to be a forward or directional component to the objects path. He said it looked like something had dropped straight down out of the sky into the river.  At that point they climbed on their 4-wheelers and rode back to the truck.  <BR><BR>The whole time he was telling me this story he became more agitated over who ever it was messing with them and spoiling their fun.  The thought of a creature doing this never crossed his mind.  Of course I was trying not to jump headlong to that conclusion, but I was very intrigued to say the least.<BR><BR>John said he checked his watch and all seven objects had hit the water within 12 to 15 minuets at approximately 1.5 to 2 minuet intervals.  (F.Y.I.  Blue River is about 30 to 40 feet across at the point where they were fishing).  <BR><BR> I ask him, & \"Did you hear anything?\"<BR><BR>\"No, nothing\" he replied \"I kept listening to try to get a fix on where they were but I could never hear them moving around\".<BR><BR>\"How do you pick up something that big and hurl it into the water seven times without making some noise on the ground?\" I ask him.  <BR><BR>\"The lantern and the stream made some noise, we were talking off and on, I don''t know.\"  he replied.  <BR><BR>\"Did you smell anything\"? I ask. <BR><BR>\"No.\" He replied.<BR><BR>\"Did notice if the nature sounds had ceased?\" I asked.<BR><BR>\"I didn''t notice the nature sounds one way or another\". He stated. <BR><BR>\"Did you have any foreboding or erie feelings?\" I probed. <BR><BR>\"Not really, I was more aggravated than anything else.  I was obviously worried and concerned for my family'' s safety and tried to maintain my composure throughout the whole ordeal, but when that last object hit the water so close, with such force, it really did scare me a little. I didn'' t experience any creepy feelings until we were on our way back to the truck and loading the 4 wheelers.  At that point I did feel the hair on the back of my neck stand on end. It felt as is we were being watched, that if I turned around suddenly someone would be there looking at me\". John replied.  <BR><BR>\"Did you hear any unusual animal noises at all?\" I continued to inquire.<BR><BR>His face changed a little and said, \"Yes, we did hear something, now that you mention it.  We did hear a strange scream once about 15 minuets after dark, way off in the distance, like a half mile away, upstream. Then again 20 to 30 minuets later, real loud, much closer maybe 200 yards upstream about 10 min. before all of the rock throwing business started\". <BR><BR>He described the screams as high pitched and approximately 4 to 5 seconds in duration. He could not determine what they were. <BR><BR>At that point I was very interested and determined to go out there the next day and have a look around. It rained heavy that night and the next several days and flooded that whole area.  I went out there about two weeks later to look for any sign and came up empty.  <BR><BR>I''m sure he and/or his wife would talk to you about their experience. I can put you in touch with them if you like. He just don''t care enough about what happened it to report it.  I wanted to go ahead and document it just in case someone else might have seen or heard something.  ",

The Trail is a 9-mile loop starting at Spurgeon Hollow Lake looping north towards Delany Creek State Park then continuing east and south connecting to the Knobstone Trail. (The Knobstone Trail is rugged state-maintained trail that winds approximately 60 miles through the Southern Indiana hills). The trail then turns west diverging from the Knobstone Trail to return to the trailhead at Spurgeon Hollow Lake. The Spurgeon Hollow Trail is situated in the middle of the Washington-Jackson State Forest. The Spurgeon Hollow Trailhead is reached from a county road a few miles off state highway 135, then a half mile off the county road down a dirt/gravel lane crossing through a couple of dry stream beds.<BR><BR>We arrived around 1:30 pm on Friday June 12, 2020. It was a sunny day with low humidity in the upper 70s (which is why we chose to hike this day). From the trailhead the path continues for a quarter mile or so and parallels the lake on your right and steep thickly wooded hills on your left. At this point, the trail splits to begin the Loop. You can go left up the steep hillside (several hundred feet climb) or continue on your right along the Lake.<BR><BR>On this initial Trailhead path, I heard two distinct knocks. We had gone most of the quarter mile. I heard the first sharp knock. Then a second or two later, the second knock. Both in the same general area  up the steep slope to the left. I stopped at the looked, but could not see anything because of the dense vegetation. There was no other sound. The knocks were sharp and moderately loud. They sounded like the report of a baseball coming off a bat. There were no other people on the trail. No one at the Lake. My Fianc stopped and looked back at me. I asked her if she heard those knocks. She of course made fun of me and said Oooo its a Squatch. She hadnt heard anything. We continued on.<BR><BR>We took the left trail up the steep slopes and for the next 6 miles went up and down steep inclines and declines. Crossed several creeks. Then about 3 hours later, the trail turned left diverging from the Knobstone Trail heading back towards Spurgeon Hollow Lake. The trail at this point parallels a large creek bed at the bottom of hills. We had gone a mile or so (about 2+ miles to go to reach the Trailhead). There was a knock. A very loud, very sharp knock. We both stopped dead. My fiancs eyes were wide as saucers. She said that was loud. I laughed and said so what do you think that was? The knock sounded again like the crack of a baseball coming off a bat. A huge baseball and a huge bat! It came from the steep hill top above us. We scanned the ridgeline, but could not see much. It was just too thick. I heard the brief sound of something moving in the brush up high, but that was it. My Fianc said Lets Go. I asked her dont you want to stay and see if something else happens? She said No I want to Go. So we starting walking. A couple of times I would stop and scan the hills. She would say Just keep walking.<BR><BR>We returned to trailhead with no further incident.<BR>",

    " It was about 7:00 PM in September. It was still pretty light outside. My brother who had come home on leave from the military was visiting us. He and I had been target shooting north of Dunkirk in a heavily wooded area. After returning back to Dunkirk we heard what sound like a scream come from the woods we had been in. The sound was extremely loud and was coming over a 40 acre field. I released my German Shepard off his leash to see if he would go investigate what the sound was. The dog promptly went through the the front screen door of the house and refused to go back outside even though he was never allowed inside the house in the past. My brother wanted to investigate what it was. I decided discretion was the better part of valor and declined. The next morning we went back into the woods in the area we heard the noise and found several trees \"scratched\" at about the 6 foot mark above the ground. Much like a bear does to mark it''s area. The only thing about it is there are no bears in Indiana. <BR>",

As soon as we heard this we abandoned the bike and jumped on our vehicles while Mark rode on the back of my quad on the way back. <BR><BR>We went back to that spot the next day around noon and the bike was not on the trail where we left it.

    " The first incident was in Febuary of 2009 after a snow. Me and my daughter who was 5 at the time went to Shades State Park to play. I was goofing around and making tree knocks every 15 minutes or so. I did not expect anything but any time I''m in the woods I try. We were making our way back to the truck and were within 500 yards when I made another set of knocks wich was followed almost immediatly by a very loud and powerfull growl. My daughter immediatly looked at me and said what is that dad. Halving my 5 year old with me made me just want to get her to the truck asap. The power and intensity was really something, it reminded me of passing a snow plow on the road, just the power of it.<BR> The following summer a couple of things happened I think are related. In june me and my buddy who like to whitewater kayak went to the Shades, Pine Hills area to kayak due to some heavy rains and flooding,wich in Indiana is the only good runs we get. That day while standing along suger creek at our buddys cottage which is across from the spot Indian creek enters suger creek we were debating how safe Indian creek would be to run when for some reason a deer jumped into the water and tried to swim across, it did not make it and got sucked under a log jam under the covered bridge. That was our sign and we descided tomorrow would be a better idea. We met around 10:30 the next day and Kayaked Indian creek which was still running fast but safer. As we was leaving Indian creek and entering suger creek at the spot we were at the day before except on the other side, I noticed to my left along the cliff face was a stack of rocks about a foot and a half tall stacked right on top of each other. What was odd was this area was still quite flooded and the area was completely under water the day before. There is know person in there right mind that would halve been in that spot over night or that morning.<BR> My last incident was in July 2009. I was catfishing about 1 am at lake Waveland about 1 to 2 miles from the Shades and Pine Hills area. I heard very cleary three short howls coming from the area around Shades. And the whole time this thing was howling every coyote in the area was going nuts. As soon as it stopped everything went silent, it was really cool I pretty much knew at that point for once and for all that sasquatch is a real and living creature, very cool. I got online when got home and found a identicle sound, the Columbiana County Ohio howls are exactly what I heard.",

    " In late July of 1974, my father, mother, and I decided to take our German Shepherd on an early evening nature walk in the woods by our house. This area is southeast of the intersection of Packard and Carpenter Roads in Pittsfield Township. It was during this trek into the wilderness that I firmly believe that I encountered a Sasquatch, or family of them. Moreover, in retrospect, I have to firmly believe that I had unknowingly come across a nest where the creature was residing at a year earlier.<BR><BR>Today this area is heavily developed with condominiums and housing subdivisions, but 34 years ago, this was a different story, as the area had an abundance of deer and other small game. I can remember my neighbor hunting rabbits, and telling me that he saw eight deer standing together in an open field. Likewise, there were wetlands nearby in the area, where we would catch frogs at. <BR><BR>The year before, my friends Cooper, Jeff and I had explored the open area, which had a winding path that lead from Packard Road to Montibeller Park, just off Ellsworth Road 1.6 kilometers to the south. We decided to venture further south than usual that afternoon, walking past the New York Central Railroads Ypsilanti Branch Line that ran from its namesake city, southwest to Saline, and on into Hillsdale. While walking south into the heavily wooded area from the open field along the trail, we found a very interesting area that we concluded was some sort of a fort.<BR><BR>We decided to go into the small area that was two meters inside the tree line, and roughly six meters in diameter. Upon entering, I noticed a rather pungent odor that smelled like a wet dog. What we found was rather amazing. There was a structure made from tree limbs that were pulled down and covered with fresh tree branches. My friend Cooper noticed that the branches had been broken and twisted off, rather than being cut with a saw. Moreover, there were three logs set up as a tripod on the inside of this area, which was covered with some fresh grass that had been torn out from someplace, maybe in the field just south of the old railroad bed. Also, there was a shirt, completely flattened Coca-Cola can, and some aluminum foil on the floor of this fort. It was like being inside an area that was designed to keep the rain off of whoever was staying there.<BR><BR>We also noticed that some of the small trees had been snapped off, or bent over in the field just across from this area. I compared them to my arm and noticed that the trees were roughly anywhere from 5 to 18 centimeters in size. We concluded that it must have been from a recent storm, as no person we knew, was that strong to twist a tree of that size.<BR><BR>After examining the area for about another 30 minutes, we all decided to head back home, since it was it was getting late and dinnertime was fast approaching. Nearly another year would go by before I would get a chance to back into this wooded area again. <BR><BR>I remembering two days after summer vacation started in June, 1974, my friend Jeff asked me to walk down to Montibeller Park with him, as his cousins were having a cookout. We followed the trail and as we approached the area where the makeshift fort was located at, we both had the feeling that we were being watched. I quickly looked inside for a few minutes, and everything was still there. However, we kept going, passing over the large drainage culvert towards the park. <BR><BR>After the picnic was over, Jeffs cousin drove us back home, and I was thankful for the ride, as I was not comfortable walking back through the woods that evening, as it was getting dark. Likewise, the mosquitoes were out in full force in the park, I could just imagine what they would have been like in the woods and wetlands. I would have been their prime menu selection for the night.<BR><BR>During the last week of July, 1974, both of my parents were laid off. Feeling rather bored, we decided to take our German Shepherd out for a walk on the trail by where lived at. He had a very outgoing personality, and was never afraid of anyone or anything. Nonetheless, it was about 1900 hours, and overcast that day as we set off on our nature walk. I would have to estimate the temperature was around 26 Celsius. <BR><BR>Everything started out just fine, as my parents were talking about my recently departed uncles two antique automobiles. Just after we crossed over the now abandoned Ypsilanti Branch Line, heading south towards the thick woods, our dog started to act more conservative and was lagging behind my father. Usually, he led the way, pulling us along for the ride. However, I didnt give it much thought at first.<BR><BR>As we walked along the trail, I heard a very loud crack like a large tree branch had snapped around 10-15 meters inside the treeline. Then around a minute later, another loud pop from the woods, and our German Shepherd was behaving strangely, growling and looking towards the woods. This is when my father took a hold of his collar as we continued to walk along. Moreover, I had the uncanny feeling that I was being watched, and had an urge to leave the area, but we continued southbound rather slowly.<BR><BR>It was at this time I started to smell something terrible, like rotten garbage. My father also commented on the foul odor, hoping there wasnt a skunk in the area. Likewise, the snapping sounds in the woods seemed to move along with us as we walked. Whatever was in the woods, seemed to walk along with us, and make an occasional loud pop, but then we would hear a much louder snap. Conversely, when we stopped moving, it did the same.<BR><BR>I entered area where the man-made fort was located at, and the foul smell was much stronger. Also, our German Shepherd had his tale between his hind legs, and was whining like he was scared. I had never seen him behave like this before. Nevertheless, I noticed a tripod made of sticks to the right side of the trail, not far from where the earlier twisted trees were lying bent over.<BR><BR>Just seconds after I had left the man-made fort and turned to walk south, we all heard a tree snap and crash like it had been deliberately broken and fallen down. I would estimate it came from 15 meters inside the woods. While I faced the woods, this sound had come from my right, and there was something stirring to my left. I can remember our dog turning and heading back in the direction we came. This sound convinced my father that a deer must be in the woods, and he didnt want a wild buck to run out and have our dog chase after it.<BR><BR>We turned and heading back northbound and the sounds of branches snapping seemed to follow us until we got to the clearing. However, I really felt like I was being watched as we left the area, and it made me feel scared to say the least.<BR><BR>In retrospect and after seeing a Bigfoot creature in 2001, and reading numerous reports on the Web, I am thoroughly convinced that I had an earlier encounter with one or more of these creatures in 1974. Its an event that I will remember until the end of my life.<BR>",

    " On the first weekend of summer, 1999, two of my sons and a friend planned a Saturday night bonfire in our backyard fire pit to celebrate the end of the school year. They went out about midnight and started a wood fire to throw their books and papers into. After the fire was going, they began to throw the school stuff into the fire. The firepit is almost visible from the couch I was sitting on in the family room on the southwest side of the house. I fell asleep about 12:30 or so, and was awakened by the slam of the bathroom door at about 1:30 AM. I asked the boys what was wrong, and my younger son and his friend were crying. The oldest son was white faced and visibly shaken. They apparently heard what sounded like women screaming at the back of our yard, to the west, then north, then east, like the screamers were surrounding our yard and taking turns making the screams. The boys said that the screams sounded like they started high pitched, then descended into a low growl and were moving. <BR><BR>I used to be an avid hunter and target shooter, but, as I moved around the country for my job, I got tired of learning new rules, etc., and stopped hunting, but I still had a few guns and police grade flashlights around the house. When we moved to this semirural area, I had a standing deal with my sons that they would get me if anything unusual happened around our property, no matter what. This time, though, they never got me up to tell me what happened. By the time I figured out that they heard something unusual (at the time I thought a local girl was being harrassed by local punks), and I got out the back door with a light, whoever/whatever was there was gone. They didn''t want to call the police because they were afraid I would tease them, let alone the police, who might think they were lying. The next morning, my sons took me out back to the field behind our property, but we found nothing. The following Tuesday night, just at dusk, my middle son heard the same scream and movement in the corn field on the east side of our house, and ran in, badly shaken. Again, I ran out, this time armed as well as with a good light, but saw and heard nothing. Interestingly, the area around us is still farms with corn, srawberries, and other crops growing most of the year, even though the area is ten minutes from Dearborn, Michigan.",

    " My boyfriend was driving me and some friends through  a wooded area near Mio, Michigan. It is some dirt roads to the left of 33(This was my first time to this part so I am not certain, exactly where I was).  We were cruising along looking at the woods that had been recently burned down. Down the road right after this hill, my boyfriend and I both saw a white figure crossing the road. Jokingly he says \"there is sasquatch\", we both just assumed it was a human since it was walking upright across the road. <BR><BR>I was unsure how how big it was since we were far down the road. When we got over the hill, I made a reference to seeing something and figuring it was a human wondering why there wasnt a car in sight. We then began talking about how strange this whole thing was. <BR><BR>We went back to the area we saw him crossing the road and looked for footprints but the road didnt show prints. We speculated on the reasons for someone being in the deserted woods. Needless to say, we drove around in circles for an hour looking.

It was about midnight; she texted me about 5 minutes after she left about a banging noise. She thought it was me making those noises to scare her. And then a chill ran down my back, because the sound she was hearing was not from me. I told her it was not me and I was a little frightened at first and I did not hear the noise at all for the rest of the night. The next night around the same time, I was walking her home and her and I both heard the same noise. At first we did not mind until we heard it again, and it was closer. We rushed back inside and left the upstairs windows open to listen. We heard the banging noises multiple times, each time getting closer and closer. We kept on hearing leaves crackling like something was walking around and we could tell it was walking on two legs because it was a steady, slow walking pace. We shined the flashlight out the window but due to the trees, we could not see it. The noises continued until around 5am.",

    " It was the summer of 1980 June or July a full moon night. At \"Fletchers Pond\" 25 west of Alpena MI. and about 10 miles east of Hillman MI. off highway 32.  Myself and a friend (Adam) decided to go fishing for bass.  We were in the cove for some time; since it was a full moon we did not bring a flashlight.  Around the midnight hour we hear this \"ROAR\" come from the shore line which was black due to the thick woods and we were on the water; within seconds something splashed into the water about 10 feet or less from the boat!  We were both pretty startled and speechless we just started the motor and headed back to the lodge \"Paradise Lodge\".  Of coarse we were teased about it and Adam would not even say a thing.  The following day another friend (Joe) and myself went in search of anything.  We had to go by boat to get to the area where \"ROAR\" came from.  It was known as the hunting club property and my first time there; as far as I know there were no buildings, but plenty of cover and trails which we walked on from the shore and came upon a small pond with slight incline banks of sandy ground.  To our findings, we did find very large foot prints, you could make out the toes as they were heading up the incline from the water.  Then on our way back to the shore and the boat my friend Joe got a little ahead of me and to my right was a thicket that you could not even see anything in this area, that is when I heard a limb snap scaring the heck out of me so much I could not even call out to Joe; I just froze in my steps.  Looking into this thicket as hard I could without seeing anything.  Then we left and that was pretty much the end of it.  I still share the story now and the then but I don''t think anyone believes it. ",

I had just crested a small hill when about 200-250 yards in front of me I saw a very large, reddish brown creature on two legs run across the road and into a very thick and wooded area.  This creature literally cleared the road in what appeared to be one huge step.  The sun was shining bright and it''s reddish brown hair really stood out.  It appeared to me the thing had been running and maybe slowed down.  As it came out into the opening and saw me it leaped or ran across the road into the heavy thicket.  It was traveling from west to east.  As I approached where it had crossed it had already disappeared into the thick woods and brush.  I didn''t look for tracks because I was so taken back by what I had just seen. Up until this time I had never believed in bigfoot or sasquatch.  Whatever I saw that day was no human or any other animal I have ever seen before.  It was very large and probably stood around 7 or 8 feet tall.  It''s body mass was proportionate to it''s height as well.  I really feel that I saw a sasquatch.  ",

    " I grew up in lower MI, right on the border of Muskegon and Oceana counties about one mile off the lake. I believed there was a bigfoot in that area. I saw on one walk an animal of tall stature, peaking out from underbrush, the head between five and six feet in height from the ground and the body was hidden. On the property were many \"bear dens\" and other areas that could provide shelter. I also saw deer carcasses cached high in trees. I saw as well, bone pillars. Piles of bones stacked two and three feet high in a very dense area of the wood. I have heard sounds, hard breathing, but not like a buck or deer, or bear. Certainly of a large animal. During a walk after dark I was chase by an enormous creature which ran on two feet and was most definately not human. Frequently, there was a feeling of being watched.....Also during this time period there were a lot of deer kills being attributed to wild dogs, I had no encounters with wild dogs in that area or their tracks or sign. Any time it felt like the creature was near there was a distinctive musk odor. Also some odd calls were let out before the chase in the dark....like nothing I had ever heard. This is in White River Township.  I will tell you, there is more than one type of \"bigfoot\" living out there, the larger more reported, and a smaller not so reported. The smaller has closer to humanlike features, and resides in upper Michigan. It has the appearance of an early ape-man on the evolutionary track....I can''t think of which one. This one runs...it has not got the aggresive nature of the larger, This is the one frequently confused as a human spirit in native mythology.",

    " It was Aug or Sept of 2011.  Warm night, around 3:30am.  We were raising broiler chickens (meat birds) in chicken tractors (mobile chicken coops).  Our bedroom window was open and I heard the sound of a squawking bird.  I jumped out of bed, grabbed the rifle (.22) and a Mykyta flashlight and ran outside--thinking coyote.  I shuffled down the slope behind our garage--toward the sound and toward the general area where the coops were--and paused at what I saw.  100 feet (I measured it the next day) ahead of me, and up the slope on the other side of this dip, was something--and I do not know what.  I shined the light on something that had huge orange eyes and was staring right at me--and standing over one of our chicken tractors.  I am guessing it was at least 6 to 6.5 feet tall, as I had my wife stand where it was the next day and she is about 5'' 3\" and it was way higher than that (maybe 7?).  I just stood there and stared at it.  I could not make out the rest of its body size or shape.  We just stared at each other.  Seconds passed and I thought about firing at it, but my one neighbor to the south''s house was right in line with him/it, and him/it being uphill of me, I''d be firing up, into the air, and toward homes--so I did not.  Also, my mind was swimming around trying to figure out what exactly I was looking at.  We continued to stare at each other.  I could see his eyes quite clearly, like detail of them.  Or so it seemed.  For whatever reason I decided to at least put the rifle in position to fire if need be.  It had been resting over my forearm, while I aimed the flashlight at it.  I took maybe 1 to 2 seconds, looking down at my hands as I positioned the rifle and flashlight together and lifted them--and he was gone.  I looked around all freaked out, didn''t see him, so ran up the hill, just running forward, flashing the rifle and flashlight in all directions--all the time running south.  I quickly tuned into the sound of something crashing through the brush on my right.  It sounded like something sprinting through the thick bramble and saplings and I could hear it breathing, exerting itself--and moving very, very fast, to the SW.  I stopped and just listened to it until I couldn''t hear it anymore.  It was running very fast--covering ground quickly.  Coming back to the chicken tractor, there was a pile of feathers sitting just outside the coop.  The bird (only one in there at the time) was fine, but missing many feathers from her rear end.  Usually, when a coyote gets them, or anything else, there will be digging of some kind.  There was none.  I went back inside and went to bed.<BR><BR>This is the second odd encounter within maybe a 1-2 month window.  It was again around 3:30-4:00am.  I was sleeping and heard something screaming outside.  At the time we had multiple chicken tractors set up in three different locations to the south of our house, plus a chicken coop in the barn.  I assumed it was coyotes getting at the chickens and jumped out of bed, grabbed rifle and flashlight and this time ran out the front door--as it sounded like it might have been from the tractors best accessed that way.  I sprinted out, over to the birds, and they were all sleeping.  I then heard the screaming again and it was clearly coming from the west, over near the pig pens and barn.  The sound continued as I ran past the pig pen (no action--all asleep) and past the barn (coop secured and closed).  The screaming led off directly west.  It sounded like it was just beyond the barn and moving west.  Like, I ought to have seen it, but was running and unable to locate it with the flashlight.  I paused at the corner near the pig pen and barn and shined the light up the two-track directly west and saw two large, orange eyes aimed right at me.  I measured the distance the next day and it was almost 300 feet exactly (~290).  The eyes stayed put, staring right at me.  I felt no desire to shoot and based on my previous encounter felt like this might be a sasquatch and why shoot it?  We stared at each other for maybe a minute?  Then it calmly turned (to its left--my right) and disappeared.  I had zero desire to go after it.  I went back inside and went to bed.  The sounds I had heard were like...screeching/howling/wailings.  Loud!  Ape-like.  Like Animal Planet.  Like jungle ape sounds.<BR><BR><BR>Third report within about a 1-2 month period.  My family of four was out one evening doing animal chores (feeding, milking, watering).  It was around 8-9pm.  We''d gotten a late start on the chores.  It was already dark.  I was down near our pigs, my son was at the backdoor with the dogs, and my wife and daughter were in the barn milking and feeding goats.  I was filling a waterer when all of a sudden a loud, freakish howl/scream/wail began right over in the woods to the west of our barn.  I yelled out \"what is that?\"  My son yelled back \"I don''t know!\"  It sounded like the wail from my previous sighting.  I dropped the hose and ran for the backdoor where the flashlight was, telling my son to put our freaking out dogs in the house.  I reached in, grabbed the flashlight and ran off into the woods.  All this time it was still wailing, and as I ran past the barn and up into the woods it had stopped.  I called my son to let the dogs out and they came out to me and tore into the woods.  They were gone about 3-4 mins and came back all excited but otherwise fine.  We all heard it, saw nothing, and wondered what it was.",

ON OUR WAY UP HE TOLD US OF AN ENCOUNTER HE HAD A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WHILE CAMPING WITH SOME FRIENDS OUT IN THE WOODS.  THEY HAD JUST CAME BACK FROM TOWN AND WERE SITTING AROUND A CAMPFIRE WHEN SOMETHING STARTED YELLING AND RUSTLING AROUND IN THE WOODS IT WAS MOVING AROUND THE PERIMETER OF THEIR CAMPSITE THEY ENDED UP LEAVING AND NEVER WENT BACK FOR THEIR TENT OR CAMPING SUPPLIES.  WE DECIDED TO HEAD TO THE SAME AREA HE HAD CAMPED AT YEARS EARLIER.  THE DIRT ROAD THAT LED BACK INTO THE WOODS WAS VERY RUGGED AND IT TOOK US ABOUT 15 TO 20 MINUTES TO REACH THE AREA.  THERE WAS A CLEARING IN THE WOODS WHERE WE PARKED AND WE WALKED AROUND LOOKING FOR A GOOD AREA TO CAMP.  WE MADE A FIRE PIT AND PICKED FIDEL HEAD FERNS TO LAY OUR SLEEPING BAGS ON TOP OF.  LATER THAT NIGHT PROBABLY AROUND 2 OR 3 MY FRIEND WOKE US UP AND SAID THERE IS SOMETHING OUT IN THE WOODS WALKING AROUND OUR CAMP AREA, MY STEP BROTHER AND ME TOLD HIM IT WAS JUST HIS IMAGINATION AND GO BACK TO SLEEP.  AROUND 5 HE WOKE US UP AGAIN AND SAID GUYS THERE IS REALLY SOMETHING OUT THERE SO WE LISTENED AND WE HEARD SOMETHING MESSING WITH MY STEP BROTHERS CAR.  WE DECIDED TO WAIT UNTIL THE SUN CAME UP TO GO INVESTIGATE.  WE GOT UP AND HEADED TO THE CAR ABOUT 30 YARDS OUT FROM OUR CAMPSITE WE NOTICED THAT SOMETHING HAD MADE A PATH THROUGH THE FIDEL HEAD FERNS AND IT ENCIRCLED OUR CAMPSITE THESE FERNS WERE THIGH HIGH AND LOOKED AS IF SOMEONE HAD BEEN WALKING ON THEM ALL NIGHT, VERY WEIRD.  WHEN WE GOT TO THE CAR EVERYTHING LOOKED ALRIGHT SO WE DECIDED TO LOOK AROUND THE AREA AND THAT IS WHEN WE FOUND A HUGE FOOTPRINT ON THE DIRT ROAD (IT WAS A SANDY AREA) AROUND SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN INCHES LONG ABOUT 7 INCHES ACROSS AND IT LEFT A DEEP IMPRESSION, WE WERE LIKE BIGFOOT.  WE WERE PRETTY FREAKED OUT AND KIND OF IN SHOCK FOR A FEW MINUTES.  WE LOOKED AROUND SOME MORE AND FOUND ANOTHER FOOTPRINT BY THE CREEK.

    " This is an older reporting. It was late spring or early summer of 2005. Located just 5-10 minutes south of Traverse City off a dirt road few miles off of Garfield rd. I was meeting up with a group of friends of mine on some Private property back in the woods. I was walking down a gated dirt road to meet with them in a spot we had found the summer before off of Arbutis lake. There we had come across previously while wondering through the woods was a hill that over looked the lake. You walked down the sandy bank that had erosion and you are at the waters edge, about 25 feet down. Any ways, i had just gotten out of work and it was around 5 or 6 o''clock pm and i had parked my car at the gate because it was locked. i continued to walk down the road. after about 10 minutes of walking i started to hear what sounded like sticks being banged together. knowing the camp site was relatively close, i thought it could have been my friends i was meeting up with getting fire wood, \"hey guys!\" i yelled out. no response, just the sound continuing, not skipping a sound... bang, bang about every second or so. \"hey you!\" i yelled thinking maybe its not them, but maybe some one else, still no response.. the sound continued. after my mind started wondering what it could have been, and knowing there was no houses for a decent walk away or so.. i decided i was going to just get out of there knowing i was alone. i quickly ran the last mile to the camp site. i stopped running once i approached the site, didn''t want my friends to think i was scared in the woods by myself, i walked the last few hundred yards to the site. i didnt say anything to them about what had happened because they would have just thought i was joking. figured i would just let it sit, and do what i could so i wouldnt have to walk back to my car later alone. <BR><BR>The night had gone on without any other occurance. until night had fallen and we were just sitting around talking. friend of mine and myself thought we would go and try to start a fire in a different location. as we proceeded to a different fire pit we had found on our previous visit there, we started gathering sticks and leaves to start a fire. as we were organizing the small twigs and leaves in the pit a small stick, 5-6 inches in length and about 2 inches thick came out of the dark woods and landed between us, bouncing and slid to a stop slightly behind our feet (as we wee kneeling side by side trying to get the sticks ready. we looked up and at each other. not having a flash light we assumed it was our other friend Phil, who always snuck off and tried to scare people. so we started to attempt to light the fire. before we got the match to the leaves another stick  (that we didnt find after it hit behind us) flew over our heads and landed in the woods behind us. \"Phil stop!\" my friend yelled. Phil replied \"doing what?\" from back at the other fire where we left him. we got up and walked back to the fire and told them what happened. why we called out Phil''s name. They didnt believe us. so we ignored it. ten minutes later friend i was with lighting the fire (Kyle) and his girlfriend at the time went down to the water to swim. left Phil and i at the fire just talking about how he''s looking forward to leaving for the army in the following months. Kyle started to freak out and yelled for us to grab the flash light. we grabbed it and jumped down the 4 foot erosion of roots and ran the distance down to the water. turned on the flash light to see a great amount of craw fish all gathered up in the shallow water. probably close to 30-40 pounds (if you were to catch and weigh them). they quickly mentioned how weird that was. As soon as that happened we heard a few thump noises through the ground up by the fire and heard the logs on the fire move... we ran back up the hill to the fire to find nothing. We looked for deer eyes with the flash light or any other eyes, nothing was there. by this time everyone was on edge. i decided to tell them my story from earlier that night, and we all decided that we were leaving, and we were leaving now. as we walked back nothing else had happened. no noises no smells nothing of that sort. just what had happened to us. then we all started to think... when we found that spot the summer before. there were people who did maintenance to it. cut the wild grass, had a hammock, and even had a few fire pits dug. water front camping, whats better? we all came to the conclusion, and the possible possibility, with what happened to us, what if that is the reason they dont camp there either.<BR><BR>Years have gone by and i dont talk to any of them any more. we all went different paths. but i am sure that none of us have gone back there to camp.

    " Hi,<BR><BR>This is really wierd for me, and I have no idea if BigFoot even exists and have never in my life considered that it may. I do not mean to waste your time and do not intend to. I just want to let you know what I have experienced and it could be nothing at all. I have NEVER in my life read about signs of a bigfoot or anything of the kind so I don''t know what to look for, but it occurred to me that something odd is going on in the woods behind my house in Northern Michigan (my summer home). Upon arrival to Michigan for the summer, I walked around the back of my house via my wraparound porch and smelled such a pungent aroma kind of like a sulfer/waste smell mixed with the strongest male body odor I have ever encountered. It was about 50 degrees outside and I could not get over the strong smell which literally overwhelmed me. The home has been vacant for months and noone would have been near the house in the preceding days of our arrival. It smelled like a man, but more like a poopy body odor but literally ten times stronger. My house is located on a cul de sac with only 2 other homes on it both at least 100 yards and 200 yards away. Our lot is big about 1-1/2-2 acres with woods on 3/4 and the 3rd hole of the golf course on the other 1/4. The woods however are quite thick and have lots of deer and turkey etc. The next day I went outside again early in the morning and smelled it again so strongly. The smell actually lasted around 2 1/2 days and then finally went away. Keep in mind that the house has been vacant for over 9 months until we arrived. Then 2 nights ago my husband and I heard a deep-throated moan or sream kind of like an animal dying but it didn''t sound like an animal and it didn''t sound human either. Strangest thing ever.

While coming towards the stop sign, I heard a rustling sound to the side of me. I figured it was leaves in the wind so I kept walking.

I walked into the trees, and crouched down behind the brush was a large, dark brown colored figure about 50 to 60 yards away. I first assumed it was a bear so I started backing up. It never moved while I was there but I got out of the woods as fast as I could. The next night, I heard howls coming from the woods.

    " First Incident: When I was about 7 years old we were at Lake Superior on the beach.  We found a set of footprints in the sand.  They were very large.  My parents said they were a lot larger then a normal footprint would be, even for a large adult.  (When your only 7 anything would seem big.)  Later when we were leaving, we heard a screeching that sounded similar to a screech owl, or a primate at the zoo.  (This is the best I can describe it.)  A Very Large \"something\" also started jumping up and down fairly close to us. We were in the woods near the lake almost to the car at the time.  We couldn''t see what it was but it didn''t appear to want us around.  My mom thought in may have been college students playing a prank or on drugs.  It was to big for that.  I wanted to go see what it was, but my parents let me.  We left in the car quickly.  A few days later there was an article in the Mining Journal (local newspaper)  that some guy and his girlfriend saw a bigfoot on an old road in the same area. <BR>",

Thick woods of varying types, hardwoods, pine etc. There is an abandoned RR grade that used to run between Marquette and Big Bay further inland. A few small \"Towns\" used to exist in this area years ago. Actually they were usually nothing more than a few houses or logging camps. There is next to nothing left of them. The film \"Anatomy of a Murder\" (1950''s) was partially shot on location in Big Bay. In the movie it is called \"Thunder Bay\", the movie was shot here as it was based on a true story. This is rugged country lots of hills in the area. Reports of cougar being sighted have happened numerous times in this general area over the last few years. Cougar stay away from people. I''m not sure if the D.N.R. acknowledges them still being up here. They usually say someone mistook a bobcat. Needless to say the locals know better. Munising/Marquette (M-28) This section of road is quite similar to my description of the Big Bay area. There have been more camps and houses built in the area since them, but it is still quite isolated.

    " I was on vacation with my family at Gulliver Lake in Scoolcraft county MI in the Upper Peninsula. Me and my sister would usually take a walk after dinner. The path we would always take was Gulliver lake road ( I believe) next to the lake that looped back to our fathers cabin. Next to the lake was a wooded area that went uphill then on the other side was large sand dune. We went out later than usual so it was completly dark outside, a moonless night save a few lightpoles. As we passed the lake and made left to the other side of the wooded area where the dunes were my sister heard something but at the time she did not say anything. As we kept walking my sister would say to me that something was following us on our left side behind the treeline. We stopped to listen I thought i heard something move but was not sure. As we started to leave the wooded area behind us we both clearly heard a grunt 20 feet behind us. It sounded like a  \" ooogghh\" or \"uuugghh\". I swear it sounded as if it tellin us to get out of its territorry. <BR><BR>",

    " To begin with, I''m not sure what I saw, but it was something I couldn''t identify, so I thought this might be the right forum to approach it.<BR><BR>During the summer of 1993, my brother and I were looking for Lake Superior Agates along the shore of Lake Superior about 3-4 miles west of the mouth of the Two-Hearted River.  It was mid-afternoon on a windy and overcast day.  When looking for agates you spend much of your time looking at the ground, but occasionally stand up to stretch your back and  look down the beach.  It was during one of these times I noticed a figure some 300-500 yards down the beach standing at the tree line in the direction from which we''d been walking.  My first instinct was that it was another agate hunter and I voiced this to my brother stating that we now had \"competition\".<BR><BR>As I watch the figure I noticed that it did not bend over (which is typical of agate hunters) nor did it move from its position at the tree line. It was at this time I realized the stature of the figure when I compared it to the nearby pines.  I then asked my brother to retrieve my binoculars from by day pack on my back, because that was the \"tallest person\" I''d ever seen and wanted to take a closer look. I also thought I might be catching a rare glimpse of a bear.  Instead of handing me the binoculars, by brother observed the figure through them first.  When I asked him if it was a man, he said he couldn''t tell, but it was \"a man-like figure\".  He then gave me the binoculars to get my opinion.  On looking at the figure through the glasses it was magnified considerably, though I could discern no color variations.  The figure was completely black.  I observed the figure walk from the tree line to the shoreline a number of times, but could not distinguish what it was doing exactly.  At one point the figure began walking towards us and made both my brother and myself quite nervous.  By this time we realized we may be seeing something extraordinary.  The figure cut another 100 yards between us in a very short period of time, but still no discernable color variations where you would expect to find them.  At this point, I observed the figure bend down and pick up a beach rock and toss it into the lake (underhand).  It was at this point when I decided it was a man and told my brother this based solely on the fact that it tossed a rock into the lake.  This seemed to satisfy both of us and we continued our rock hunting ignoring any subsequent activities of the figure.<BR><BR>In retrospect, I believe we were so quick to identify the figure as human because we had to return to camp in the same direction and the alternative to the figure being human was unacceptable.  We did not look for prints on our way back nor did we discuss the incident until some days later (there was no reason to do these things, because we had resigned ourselves to identify the figure as human).  A few days later, we were conveying the story to a relative jokingly referring to it as our \"bigfoot story\".  When our relative asked us \"why wouldn''t a bigfoot throw rocks\", we realized we may have identified it as human too quickly and unfortunately may have missed more detailed identification through the investigation of footprints.",

    " This took place in the summer of 1986. Myself and four other friends decided to go on an over night camping trip about 2 miles from my friends house. There were 3 men and two women all together. The ages ranged from 15-17. The area we choose to camp in is known as the Beaver Pond (at least to us and our friends it was). We were driven, by my friends father, to within a half mile of where we planned to camp. We hiked in the rest of the way in with our tent and supplies. The area we were camping in was on a ridge that ran along an old small lake. Our campsite was on the top of the ridge on an old road that was used as a snowmobile trail in winter. To one side of our campsite was a steep hill that went right down to the waters edge. On the opposite side the ridge sloped down into a swampy area, very thick with brush. On either end of the camp the ridge continued for a short distance, 20 yards or so, before sloping down into the lower, thicker woods. We arrived at our site after dinner time, probably around 6 or 6:30 I''d say. We had a large yellow one room tent that we set up on the top of the ridge looking over the lake. We set about gathering firewood and getting ready to make some hamburgers. The evening proceeded uneventfully for several hours. Being teenagers, we didn''t plan on getting much, if any, sleep. I should point out that we were a pretty straightlaced group so there were no drugs or alcohol being used that night. As I remember, we built our fire and made something to eat and sat around the fire drinking sodas. We never really ventured far into the woods around our site. Perhaps a few yards to gather wood and down to the waters edge. As best I can recall it was about 1 or 1:30 a.m. when first something happened. Another thing I should mention here is that as children having grown up in the woods and around outdoor activities, we were all very comfortable out of doors and very familiar with the creatures that inhabit the Upper Penninsula. The first thing that happened was a distance noise. It sounded much like a screeching sound a chimp might make. It sounded quite distant, probably over a mile as it was barely audible. It came from the direction of the swamp. The swampy area at the base of the ridge was not actually all that large, maybe a quarter mile thick. So, we realized that the noise must have been coming from the pine forests on the other side of that swamp. I know even though the first sound was very faint and short it gave all of us a strange feeling. We tried not to think much about it and returned to whatever conversation we were having. A few moments later we heard the noise again. Much clearer and closer this time. I would estimate that it was probably 400-500 yards away. Still a good distance but significantly closer than before. It was again, one lone 2 or 3 second screech. After hearing this one we were unable to go back to our old conversation and began to discuss the noise and it''s possible sources. We all agreed that none of us had ever heard anything exactly like before. One of us ventured that it sounded like an animal in heat might. The other said that sometimes an animal being killed can make a terrible sound. No one was satisfied with either explanation. We sat, fairly quietly, waiting to see if we would hear more. After a few moments the screeching began in earnest. Whatever was making the sound had come to within 40-50 yards of our site and was at the base of the ridge down on the swampy side. It almost seemed as if the thing had made a direct line for our camp from the first moment we had heard it. The next 3 hours were truly terrifying. The thing began to move around our camp. Always staying at the base of the ridge. It circled all the way around us, going from the waters edge on one side to the waters edge on the other. The sounds varied coming from the woods. Sometimes we could hear the sound of branches breaking as though something large were moving in the trees and other times we could hear nothing moving. Sometimes it would move around us, screeching as it did so. Other times it would make its noise in one place and then make it again on the opposite of the camp a minute later without our having heard one bit of movement from the woods. We tried shining our flashlights out into the woods but could see nothing. I can''t remember if it had a reaction to our lights but I don''t believe so. Over the next three hours this continued. Sometimes the thing would go silent for perhaps 5 minutes or so only to erupt again with a fresh tirade. We had no idea what to do or think. I can honestly say that all of us were more frightened than we had ever been before. We had no weapons save a pair of the \"Rambo\" style hunting knives that were popular among teenage boys in the 80''s and a couple of pocket knives. We kept the fire going strong. I remember a couple of times when we all went inside the tent just to feel a little safer but we would quickly come back out when the thing would quit for a few moments. I''m not sure if we thought it was going to sneek up on us or what. I do remember feeling very insecure when it would get silent. At least when it was making noise we knew where it was. This is how things went until around 4 a.m. At around that time the screaching ceased and the thing left exactly the same way it had came. We heard a screech after a few minutes that seemed to be several hundred yards away and then one more in the distance and then it was gone. Suffice to say we did not sleep. At first light we took off at a jog down the dirt road towards the main road. I wish that we had taken more time to look for signs but we were all just scared. I do remember that we did take note of the fact that we saw no tracks on the sandy dirt road despite the fact that the thing must have crossed it 2 or 3 dozen times that night. Again, I have to say we didn''t look very thoroughly though. We just wanted to leave. We walked to my friends house about a mile and half to two miles away. We told his father all about what had happened and we were promptly dismissed as having overactive imaginations. This is what would happen with every adult we shared our story with. We did go back later that day to get our gear. My friends father gave him the truck so we could drive right into our campsite. We threw our things in the back and got out as quickly as possible. It has been several years since this has happened. I''ve told many people about it but never anyone who was in a position to truly evaluate or have an interest. I have heard some of the bigfoot sound recordings and have to say that some of them are very similiar to what we heard that night. I''ve had many explanations proposed to me about what happened that night but none has ever satisfied me.",

    " I was camping at the Clark Lake campground in Sylvania Wilderness and went exploring the backroads of the Ottawa Natl Forest on a Saturday morning.  I thought I''d go explore Langford Lake, Pomeroy Lake, and Moosehead Lake. I was driving toward Langford Lake campground, and I took US-2 from Watersmeet and made a left onto CR 527.  About 1/2 way before I got to Langford Lake Rd., I was shocked to see what looked to be \"a monkey with a bear''s body\" right in front of the car.  This \"being\" crossed the road right in front of the car.  If I hadn''t have slammed on the brakes, I would have hit it!  It was NOT a bear.  I have seen tens of bears in both rural Michigan and rural Virginia over the past 30 years, some while driving and some while hiking, some even face-to-face.  This was not a bear.  All I kept thinking to myself was \"why is there a monkey in the woods? why is there a monkey in the woods?\".  I was stunned and baffled and my mind just couldn''t \"figure it out\".  It was like the very first time (while in rural Virginia) I saw a cougar (up close and personal in our yard).  My mind just couldn''t comprehend.  After the being crossed the road, I stopped the car and tried to look for it.  There was a small gully on the left that it must have gone down into; but I couldn''t see it.  The brush was thick.  I was stunned.  My mind couldn''t make sense of it all.  Here was this being, maybe 5 feet in length, dark black-brown, four-footed, running on all fours (not running like a bear runs, I''ve seen that too), with its underbelly about 2 feet off the ground.  Long and lean, it seemed to me.  Not running very fast, but brisk.  Of all the funny things in the world, it \"seemed\" to be \"smiling\".  It was not threatening at all.  It seemed very innocent.  No pointed head, eyes brown, not a snout.  Not a furry face.  Looked like a monkey''s face.  No tail.  It all happened so fast and I wish I had been able to follow it, once it crossed the road.  This was not a bear cub - I have seen at least a half a dozen of them in my life too - climbing trees in the Adirondacks, crossing roads in central VA.  I am still baffled to this day as to what this being was; although something in my gut tells me that I saw a \"baby bigfoot\".  ",

    " I saw a Big Foot when my aunt, cousins and parents were camping at our property.  We had a fire blazing and we kept hearing these strange noises, branches breaking and thumps.   After about an hour of this, I was wondering what might be lurking in the woods.   So I went over to the area where I heard the noises to see what it was;  I went about 10 yards from the fire.  All of a sudden, something about waist high ran very fast in front of me.   To this day I dont know what it was; I turned and about nine feet away I saw an eight foot creature staring at me.   I did not get any facial details.  I was too far away from the fire.  I could tell that its head had a point on top.  It stared at me for about 10 seconds, but it felt like 10 minutes.  Then it did this slow turn away from me and walked away.  I ran back into the cabin and I did not come out for the rest of the night.  I did not tell anyone right away, because I thought it might have been a trick on me (played by my cousins).   Six months later my parents and I found a 15 inch footprint alongside the pond at our property, when we were fishing near the area of my sighting.  We took pictures of the footprint.   About two years after my sighting my Dad and I were camping out at our land, the same area, and me and my Dad heard a knock.  The next day I found a 20 inch footprint.  I had a camera with me and I took pictures of that footprint.   I have no doubt that there is a Sasquatch that has been living around our property. And I think it might still live there.      ",

She didnt know I was laying by the bushes until she was pretty much right on top of me. She Freaked Out. Its just what I now believe happened. Could I be wrong?

    " In the summer of 1970 being young and still interested in kissing the girls I had a unique experience. We were riding around in my 1962 chevy convertible with the top down. On the edge of town there was a park, Stone State Park, consisting of 1132 acres surrounded by farms and overlooking the big Sioux River, dividing Iowa and South Dakota. We decided to go to lookout point at the park and park for a while. It was a beautiful summer night and just light enough to see in the dark. When we got there the girl I was with and I decided to take a blanket and place it on a flat spot about 20 or 30 feet from the edge of the parking lot overlooking the river. To one side of where we placed the blanket there were trees and bushes. The other couple were in the back seat of the car with the top down. We had perhaps been there for no more that 15 minutes or so and I was on the blanket kissing when all of a sudden there was something in the bushes beside us screaming down at us at the top of her lungs. The volume was mind blowing. As we were running the scream seemed to still be directed toward us. I didnt even open the door of the car, I just jumped in and I think the girl with did the same. Although we were only kissing, almost right away and for about 35 years, I believed it had to do with babies. For all that time I was thinking she screamed at us because it was the wrong time of year for us to even think about such a thing, and thus got screamed at. Untill now. Recently captiankillmore put a link to sightings on the forum. When I went and read it, I think I may have found the answer to my thinking babies all these many years. At the time and for about 35 years it was just a sixth sense feeling. Her scream as it went on sounded just like a human women, except louder with unbelievable volume.",

    " I arrived at the area at around 2 in the afternoon.  I was in this location because it is an area that I have found signs of interest in the past.  I began my hike down a maintenance road that is gated off to normal traffic.  About a quarter of a mile down the road I dropped off into a dry creek bed to continue to the area.  This creek bed makes for an easy travel rout and is a great place to look for tracks.  After a lengthy walk I climbed out and headed into a dense section of timber and the hillside I was planning on scouting that day.  I slowly worked my way along the hillside in a zig-zaging pattern so that I could thoroughly search the area.  Along the hillside I did find 2 arches, several tree breaks, and an interesting structure of 3 small saplings woven together.  As I continued up the hill my attention was focused on looking for more sign when a very quick sharp noise stopped me in my tracks.  I wasnt sure exactly what it was that I had herd, but I knew it was out of place.  I was fairly certain that it had come from the top of the hill above me so I stayed in place and focused my attention in that direction.  I stayed put for about 2-3 minutes trying to figure out what I had herd.  As I stood there I began to get that uneasy feeling.  Not fear, but the feeling of being watched, or something being out of place.  I decided not to let my imagination get the better of me and began to take a couple of steps farther up the hill, but kept my eyes and ears focused on the crest of the hill.  I had taken no more than 5 steps when the noise came again.  This time I know I herd 2 very distinct, sharp clacks.  It was 2 rocks being smacked together.  This obviously stopped me again. I decided to just change direction and head back down the hill and out of the area.",

Then we sat to do an EVP session, before we started the recorders we heard something kill a deer, then it sounded so close we decided to maybe get out of there, we started to leave and got some eye shine, thought maybe coyotes, but looked at the pics, the eye shine is well over the 3 ft peas growing in the farm field, what''s weird is I went out today, and there''s nothing in the field disturbed, no blood, no body, no trace of anything?? I know there are no sightings this low in Wisconsin, but still kind of weird!

    " Saw the report of wood knocking on Fitzsimmons Road in Oak Creek WI and wanted to comment that I experienced this in the very same area back in 1976 or so. I was with 3 friends parked at the cul de sac that used to be right off Fitz between the RR tracks and lake. The short stretch went north about 1/4 mile or less. There was one streetlight at the end of the road - nothing else. Back then, there were no walking paths - the area was more remote than today. It was late in the summer - well past dusk. Probably between 9 - 10pm. We were hanging out outside the vehicle. We hear a series of wood knocks in the distance - didn''t give it much though. After several minutes, another series, only closer. Close enough it got our attention and we commented. A few more minutes and now a series of 2 or 3 knocks very loud and close. We bagged it into the truck and got out of there. If it was someone messing with us, I don''t know where they could have come from or how they could move through the woods in total darkness. ",

She was probably going about 45 miles per hour and our biggest regret has been and always will be, not turning around to confirm our gut feeling. We did not see it''s face and/or it''s whole body because it was sitting and facing the opposite direction. It was big hairy and brown. It''s head was oblong and sort of came to a point with no real definition between its head and neck until it''s broad shoulders. It''s arms were extremely long as well. They were so long the hands were kind of bent beside it''s upright body. It was NOT a bear! I would be willing to put money on that it was a gorilla before a bear. It was sitting on its butt just like a person would. People have said we are crazy for years and say it was a bear. The location where we saw the Sasquatch is not a prime bear location!!",

    " We set out to do some squatching at Interstate State Park in Wisconsin.  Our party consisted of 4 adults and 2 children.  We set up camp and had dinner in the South Campground.  After dark we began our first night op at 10pm.  We left my wife and the 2 year old in camp with the fire.  Nick, his pregnant wife Jennie, their 5 year old son Atticus, and I went up a small ridge above our campsite to begin.  We walked slowly working south east of camp and further from the campground.  After about 5 minutes we heard something in the woods following us intermittently we stopped and waited with lights off for about 4 minutes. We continued to walk and stop with lights off until we got about a half mile from the camp.  At this point Atticus, the 5 year old, was ready to go back.  We started back and then stopped to do some whoops.  I did two whoops spaced about 30 seconds apart, no returned noises.  We continued to walk and stop.  When we were halfway back we let Atticus try some whoops.  He did two about 30 seconds apart.  After his second whoop there was an immediate response from within a hundred yards of us.  It was a slightly higher pitch whoop than I have heard before.  We waited about 4 minutes before continuing to go back to camp.  When we were about 100 yards from camp we stopped.  Jennie and Nick remained with lights off as Atticus and I turned our flashlights on and returned to camp.  As they sat by a tree they both heard something approaching them from the direction of the returned whoop.  It got so close that Nick stood up.  Then it took four large, quick, heavy steps back.  When Nick turned his flashlight on nothing was seen.  They then returned to camp.  As we sat and debriefed in camp we heard noises around camp, but dismissed them as raccoons.  I was looking to the woods beyond camp and began to see orange eye shine.  I thought it was a single star, but it moved lightly and would leave and return into view.  The next morning I saw that where I was seeing the glow was well below the ridge line and could not have been a star. Nick and I traded places while sitting in camp and he saw the same shine leave and return a few times as well.  Nick and I returned to near where he and Jennie had sat to leave an apple in a tree.  We all went to bed around 12:30 am.  Nick, Atticus, and I slept in a tent while Jennie, Sara and Hagen slept in a small teardrop camper.  After falling asleep Nick and I both woke up abruptly at 1:35am.  We immediately looked outside the tent to see a raccoon on the picnic table.  When we made noises to scare it away we heard something else moving around camp. We listened for a while before returning to sleep.  At 3:10 am we were woke up again.  We listened for a while, heard nothing, and went back to bed.  In the morning Jennie told us what happened to them in the camper.  At 1:35 am she was woke up not by the raccoon on the picnic table, but by something large walking in the woods behind camp.  She heard us scare away the raccoon and whatever was in the woods walked off.  At 3:10 am something started to shake the camper.  She said the camper was moved back and forth 3 times.  Her reaction was to laugh out loud from inside the camper.  She laughed because Sara and Hagen were sleeping through the event.  The shaking stopped and she heard something retreat back into the woods.  ",

    " In late August of 1967, C.H. and I, E. M. a Chicago Police Officer were walking on a trail on the NE part of the Menominee Wisconsin Indian Reservation. It was late afternoon as we walked south on the trail, in front of us about 50 feet away in the woods, we heard screaming so loud we did not think ten men altogether could have duplicated the sound which did not stop for at least three minutes with no break for breathing. The scream was very high pitched unlike any noise we had ever heard. Whatever it was, it then started shaking and breaking tall birch trees. These trees were far larger than any human or group of humans would have ever been capable of breaking. We were astounded and started to run north on the trail out of the area. This thing followed us running paralel to us along a ridge. It was still screaming and shaking the trees for about 200 feet. For many years we never told anyone about this incident but with numerous reports similar to ours about bigfoot in the Wisconsin area we have started to tell people about this strange espisode. We were on the trail going South from St. Joseph and Marsh Lake Menominee Reservation. The Reservation is about 65 miles NW of our house in Door County. At the time the Indians on the reservation said they would not going into the area by the lake because they said something large and strange lived in the area. ",

    " Hello <BR><BR>This is something that had happened twice in 2 years .But in the same month of August. I believe in August of 2010 at night I had smelled something very very bad like body odor at night. It was an august summer night my dogs (2 labs) just looked at the window and didn''t even bark or move. But I remember earlier that night the dogs wouldn''t even go outside.So it was about 2 in the morning and I got up and closed my windows because of the smell. That was the only time I had smelled anything like that ever.<BR><BR>Then last summer 2011 in august again I was out hanging clothes to dry (I work 2nd shift) on the line. I could hear the coyotes barking from the other side of the lake which I live on and the coyotes barking out behind a horse pasture behind my place . My dogs were over by the lake.Then all of a sudden they came running to the driveway facing the pasture . They wouldn''t go past the light of the house.And the weird thing was all the noises I was hearing like the coyotes and the night noises stopped. The dogs kept looking up the driveway and at the little bit of swamp next to the house.So after I got my clothes hung up I got into the house as fast as I could. <BR><BR>One thing that made me think about what had happened was from watching your show. And even know I haven''t seen one I do believe . I have also seen a wolf up here that was as large as the front of my car 4 feet tall at the back .It was the biggest wolf I have ever seen.",

    " It was late afternoon/ early evening in September and we were sitting on our pier watching our dog, Sofie, swim and retrieve tennis balls. I had my binoculars to look for loons when we heard what sounded like a large tree branch or a large animal stepping on a downed tree across the lake from where we were sitting,  approximately 450 feet. I was excited because I thought I was finally going to see a bear. Next there was a loud splash in the water that sounded like a very large animal or something large being thrown in the water. <BR><BR>I looked across the lake with my binoculars but didnt see anything, so I assumed the activity was in the marsh beyond the tree line. During this time my dog got out of the water and sat at the end of the pier next to us. She appeared nervous and kept staring across the lake toward the sound. Over the next several minutes we heard three separate wood knocks like someone was hitting a baseball bat against a tree. <BR><BR>At this point it was dusk and our dog was visibly upset; she left the pier and headed back to our campsite so we followed her. Of note the land across the lake is state land, undeveloped and predominantly heavily wooded with a large marsh area beyond the trees lining the lake. Just wanted to share because I dont know of any animal that knocks and Ive never witnessed my dog that upset.",

    " On June 30th, 2018, at approximately 9:45pm, I was headed south on Highway 13, approximately two miles south of Park Falls in Price County, Wisconsin. It was dark, with my headlights the only light source.  <BR><BR>In summary, while driving at approximately 50mph, an animal on all fours ran in front of my vehicle (2015 Ford Taurus SHO) - left to right/east to west.  I nearly hit the animal as it came within five feet of the front of my vehicle. My observation was only a split second, but it left a very big impression, mainly because it didnt make sense (as explained in the last paragraph). My wife was in the passenger seat, but was on her phone texting, and she only looked up because I swerved to avoid the animal. She never observed it. <BR><BR>Hairy and brown, I did not see the head, mainly because it was slumped down on fours, and the fast speed it was moving. My dimensions are approximate from my viewpoint as the driver<BR>46 high (legs), 46 (long) torso = 92 or 76 if standing. (I took a tape measure, and immediately took approximate measurements after arriving to my destination five or six miles away).<BR><BR>Ive been vacationing in this area since 1975 as a child.

    " Back in 1991, I went for a hike on the woods just north of my families cabin, in the area east of the Lac Du Flambeau Indian Reservation and within the Northern Highland State Forest.It was a big mistake not to bring a compass when I started hiking west off of Rux Road, in the town of Arbor Vitae, at the southern edge of the State forest and I soon became turned around, going in circles. Everyting looked the same eventually no matter which way I headed, and I kept ending up in the same place. I have been fishing and hiking in this area since I was a child though, and knew that if I followed Mishonagan creek, then headed away from it westward, I would eventually reach civilization. I couldn''t find the creek any longer however, but knew that I had to go past the swamp.<BR><BR> There is absoulutely no development or even roads in this area,(except a few old logging trails) and it took me 12 hours and having to cross a swamp in waist deep water and knee deep muck until I reached the Reservation.<BR><BR> At around midday or so, I went out into a large bog near Devine Lake, I believe, which is a complete wilderness lake, and tried to wave down a passing plane, to no avail. There was a mucky deertrail going through the bog, with many animal tracks. <BR><BR> But then I saw something I thought was fascinating, in the mud, there were huge footprints in the bog that looked almost human, but were probable twice the size of my own (I wear size 12). I don''t think they were large bear tracks, as there were no claw marks, nor did it look like the tracks of a four-legged animal. They looked like huge human footprints, with really big toes. They ended where the ground became more dense and was covered with moss and weeds.<BR><BR> I know what I saw, it was in broad daylight, and I wasn''t drinking or anything. I studied them for quite some time before I decide to try to find a way home. <BR><BR>Also, after I got out of the swamp, late in the day, I had to make may way through some dense thickets of shrubs and raspberries, and stopped for a moment to eat some of them. I then heard some grunting sounds, but couldn''t see anything as the visiblilty was about a foot in front of my face. It could have been a bear, but sounded strange.

    " This incident happened a long time ago, and never told too many people about it.  I am a 31 year old Native American, and I was maybe 6 or 7.  I am glad to know that there are people like you who take this seriously.  It was night, and my sister and cousin were playing around on the phone (they would dial our number & hang up the phone so it would ring).  They had music playing (loud), and were just playing around.  The door bell rang, and one of us answered the door, but there was no one at the door.  Well, this happened 2 more times.  We had a little housedog (we also had a st. bernard), and my sister and cousin noticed that the house dog was crouched under a chair in our livingroom.  The last time the door bell rang, we all went outside, and couldn''t see no one around (we all stood out on the porch). It was maybe a half hour later, my oldest brother went to the refrigerator.  The rest of us kids were playing in the hallway when he came running down the hallway with his hands to his face, and crying hysterically.  He ran in our parents room and jumped on the bed landing on his stomach.  He was crying pretty bad.  We all kept asking him what was wrong, and he finally told us what he saw.  He said he saw something peeking around the tree, and he said it was motioning to him to like \"come out\".  That''s when he freaked out. After about 15 minutes (he calmed down some), there was knocking at the back door, and the way they were knocking, it was like, open the door now!  When we opened the door, a guy who lived a few houses away, came in as white as a sheet, and was shaking pretty bad.  He said he broke down a ways from our place, and when he was walking up the road, he heard something walking in the woods with him.  He didn''t know what it was.  He said he was really glad to see our lights on.  Our parents weren''t home (mother working; father-didn''t know where he was), but we ended up calling our Uncle''s, who lived next door to us.  They arrived a few minutes after we called them, and they had their shot guns with them.  They came and talked with the guy that came to our house.  I think one of my uncles took him home.  There was 6 of kids home (one was our cousin).  My uncles went outside to look around, my oldest sister and our cousin wanted to go outside too.  Well, when they opened the back door, our st. bernard, well let me tell you, for the size of those dogs, that dog would not let those girls out, and he even growled at them.  Well my sister and cousin backed up from the door, and as they did that, the st. bernard came running into the house.  Well, my sister and cousin still went outside, and as they were standing by this little trail by the house, they noticed some dark form at the bottom of the hill/trail.  They thought maybe it was a stump, but then the stump moved and turned to look at them.  My cousin said it had red (?) eyes.  They came back inside right away.  Our cousin went out again (back door), and went around the house to the front, and when she got to the corner of our house, she looked up towards my uncles garage, and said she saw something peeking around the garage.  She said she thought it was one of our other cousins, but she noticed this had a cone shaped head as it looked around the garage towards our house.  They ended up putting us kids to bed (3 of us).  My sister and I were pretty scared, and our little brother (he had a crib) didn''t really know what was going on.  My sister and I were shaking in bed.  Our brothers crib was right next to the window.  We were really hoping whatever was out there, didn''t come to our window.  Well, we did see a big figure go by.  We were just so scared!  It seemed like forever when our parents got home. When they did we told them what happened.  My mother ended up calling a spiritual guide, and he told her that there was probably 3 of those things around the house that night.  He also told her that they were looking for a boy to take.  He said that one of them may have lost one of their own, and came looking for a young boy to replace the one they lost.               ",

    "across our house there was a corn feild, and just a bunch of trees. When you out our back door, there is a road that goes to two other houses, and behind those houses, there is a lake. On the other side that road, there used to be a small swamp, but over the years, it dried up. We live on a hill, and that trail I mentioned, leads to that road, and you can walk to either house. Really not far, you can see either house clearly during fall and winter months. During the summer, it''s a little harder to see with the trees and some bushes that grow.",

    " On June 1,2002  I checked out animal tracks on a muddy curve near Danbury, Wisconsin.  I soon noticed a 17 1/4 inch human like footprint. So drove into town to purchase a camera and casting material. Before leaving the find area I tossed some apples from the car into the brush at the site. Returning there after about one hour in town and driving. I took photos of the footprint and surrounding area. I then began to cast the print. While doing this a commotion of rustling bushes started up nearby. It appearred to do so without benefit of much wind. So I stood up apprehensibly and looked in that direction. As I stepped back to get a better look the rustling\"bushes shot twenty feet in the air accompanied by a loud crack. Where upon the top of a birch tree that had been pulled down and shaken fell to the shoulder of the road within a few feet of me. That was followed by three or four whinny type vocalizations very close by in the woods. The sound did not appear to be a threatening one but rather a mischievious chuckle of some type. Days later the outline of a bigfoot creature was found on one of the photos. I am with holding that photo until I can authenticate it thoroughly. The figure stood about seven feet or so  and on several other occasions following June 1st  made himself known to me by following me as I checked the road for further footprints{none \"castable\" found] . Creature appearred to cross the road in three places,each where the stream nearby passed close to the road. Either to avoid being seen in the water or to avoid areas where modern day trappers put beaver sets. Creature travels otherwise exclusively in the water for which he is perfectly evolved.Think about it ,the wide feet, the up then straght down step, the weight to anchor against current s ,the height to still spot danger and long arms to reach down ,not up!.

    " Started on a three day hike in Gifford Pinchot National Forest on 8 Sept 09 at trail head #48 near East Crater.  After the first day of hiking into Indian Heaven Wilderness and spending a cold night at Elk Lake, I decided to hike to a lower elevation near Forlorn Lakes in which I camped on the second night (GPS N45 57.889 W 121 45.536).  I was outside a designated camping site about 200 meters west in a small valley that paralleled road Nf6035.  No one was occupying the camp grounds nearby that night and it was a very quiet night, until I was awaken with what I describe as three consecutive whooping yells followed by a guttural scream that lasted for about 3 seconds.  It was very loud.  Startled, I remember looking at my watch at the time and it was about 0230hrs.  After the whooping calls, I heard very faint distant calls or howling (not whooping).  The source of the scream was definitely coming further up valley I was camped in (maybe 200-300 meters away).  I stayed awake for a couple more hours in my tent and heard nothing more during the night.  I hiked alone for the three days, therefore no further calibration can be offered from another witness.  But I do find something interesting, the sound I heard was a very close match to the recordings of whooping sounds on this web sight.  Hope this small report helps. ",

    " My friend and I traveled on an old logging trail about 2 miles in my pickup in a heavily forested area about 20 miles northeast of Duluth, Mn. Close to the mouth of the Big Sucker river. I had to stop the truck as we approached a very old bridge that had been washed out years before. We were deep into the woods at this point. The nearest house was probably 4 miles away, close to highway 61. I had never been this far on this trail by truck, however, I have hunted grouse in this area on foot before, sometimes walking for hours. We got out of the truck and walked over to the small broken down bridge and looked around, no way to get across so we started talking and etc. All of a sudden we heard a series of screams and howls in the area across the bridge from us. \"It\" was getting closer and louder. Being a woodsman, I checked the wind and observed that the wind was blowing our scent toward the screaming and howling entity. We could hear crashing and breaking of large branches together with the terrible screams and decided that it had zeroed in on us and that we had better get the hell out of there, fast! The hairs on my arms stood up and my adreniline kicked in. Both of us ran to the truck and locked the doors. I rolled down my window on the driver''s side as I was turning the truck around and I could still hear the thing coming closer. I could not see too far into the thick brush but I knew that it was close. We finally got the truck turned around on the narrow one-lane road and fled. My friend was so afraid that she didn''t want to ever talk about it again.<BR>\tI am a native of Northern Minnesota and I have hunted, fished, and hiked many areas up there and I have never heard anything like that before. I was also trained as a big game guide in Montana and no animal fits this description that I know of. I now live in Auburn, Washington and still do some exploring up in the mountains near Greenwater. I am armed when I venture up into the hills now, not only with a pistol but with my camera. Another thing that I might mention is that I recently heard a recording of Bigfoot on the radio one night that made me get goose bumps all over again. That recording brought back the memories of my experience as it was EXACTLY what I heard so long ago in northern Minnesota.",

    " My friend and I were sitting on my porch smoking a cigarette and talking about the recent drama going on in our lives. Straight in front of us about 60 yards was an iron ore hill, the top of it was clearly visible with a straight flat top as most of them are. On the top of the hill in the middle of our view was a single tree. As we were talking and smoking a person comes walking on the top of the hill. I started to make fun of the way this person was walking. The Arms were long and swaded back and forth with each stride. The legs were also long and odd looking as it walked. It walked in a frumpy way. the upper back was hunched slightly. It passed the tree and thats when I said, \"look how tall that person is.\" It was about 4 feet taller than the tree. In the time that it took to walk in and out of our view point was about 40 seconds. After it was out of sight was then when we realized that no person could walk that distance in that short of time, and no person would be that tall looking that far away. I seriously feel that we saw bigfoot that day. <BR><BR>",

Everything was fine until we went to bed at around 3:45 in the morning.  4 girls slept in one tent while my best friend and I slept in another tent.  About 15 minutes after we finally got settled in we heard some loud screaming/grunting.  I knew that I had never heard anything like that before.  My friend and I were totally silent and listened again.  We heard it again but it was moving fast thru the forest.  We agreed that after that we would not be able to sleep by ourselves.  We left our tent, grabbed the hatchets from our campsite and slept in the tent with the other girls.  I did not sleep at all that night until after sunrise.  I was scared out of my mind!  I stayed awake with the hatchet in my hand for the rest of the night and the following night.  Later on that same evening/morning I heard something walk thru our campsite but I didn''t even move.  I was too scared.  In the morning I thought I heard our cooler open but I was much too tired and thought it was one of the girls.  When I got up all of our water was gone out of our cooler, but the beer and food was left.  We never woke the other girls up that night and we didn''t tell them until morning.

    " While reading sightings on your website, I noticed that there was one for Custer, SD.  I and my boyfriend had experienced some strange things happen while were working at a Native American Youth camp outside Custer.  I have worked at this camp before and have heard strange things.  <BR><BR>The occurrences took place in August of 2003.  The camp is somewhat isolated by forest, hills, and a small lake.  The first occurrence happened when some of us decided to go canoing out on the lake late at night (maybe around 11 pm).  It was dark, no moon light that I can remember.  My boyfriend and I had come back to shore and were standing  and talking along the shoreline.  I was facing toward some of the cabins that are situated on a hill (those cabins are lit by one light post), when I noticed what looked like a person standing up the hill beside a pine tree.  I couldn''t guess the exact height as it was on an incline, but would say it was rather tall as it stood at least 4-5 feet about bushes that were a little shorter than my waist when I stood by them.  My boyfriend had his back to the thing, and I didn''t say anything to him right away, because I wasn''t sure of what I was seeing.  I kept looking at it and noticed that it had fur.  Maybe 30 seconds went by when I finally said something to my boyfriend.  I told him I thought something was watching us. He said it was probably one of our friends who is very tall, but I replied I don''t think he''s as tall as the thing that''s watching us.  He still had not turned around at this point, because shortly after he said that I saw our friend walking back to his cabin at the top of the hill under the one light post.  I said, \"no it''s not ''cause he''s walking right there.\"  That''s when he turned around to look at where I was looking.  The thing stood there for moment then stepped behind the tree.  My boyfriend did not see it, so I was pointing and directing him to where it was standing.  It just sort of disappeared, and seemingly never re-emerged.  We both got creeped out and I asked him to walk me back to my cabin.  <BR><BR>When the kids showed up, things were okay for the first couple of days.  Then one night after our first staff meeting (held at 11 pm, supposedly after the kids had gone to sleep), the male counselors returned to their cabins to find all the boys huddled into one cabin.  They were frightened and they told their counselors that they had heard something outside the cabins and that it was throwing branches and/or rocks at the cabins.  Some of the boys said they saw something at the back of the cabins and they were sure it was a bigfoot, only they had another name for it - Tallman.  The branch and rock throwing continued off and on during the camp around the boys'' cabins.  <BR><BR>On another night, our camp director whose cabin was close to the bathrooms got up around 4 am to go to the bathroom and noticed a foul smell.  She told us that morning after we woke up and were getting ready.  She said \"I think there was a bigfoot here this morning.\"  One of us asked why she thought that, and she told us that she smelled one, and was familiar with the scent, having had bigfoot experiences of her own when she first started the camp program in Oregon.<BR><BR>Towards the end of the camp, after another late staff meeting, my boyfriend returned to his cabin.  He went to open the door but it was locked.  He knocked on the door and was looking through the window of the door and noticed movement across the cabin through another window that was opposite the door.  He said he saw something huge move in front of that window and then realized that something was staring back at him through the same window.  Before he could make out what it was it stood up and moved away from the window. He kept knocking on the door and one of the boys opened the door.  He found the boys had moved their bunk beds away from the windows and were sleeping in the middle of the room.  He didn''t say anything to them about what he had just seen because he didn''t want to scare them anymore than they already were.  The boys immediately surrounded him with their beds, even sleeping on the floor near him. They also insisted on keeping the doors locked and keeping the fire going. <BR><BR>On the last night, I heard something familiar from a previous camp experience.  It still gives me chills thinking about it.  A few of us were sitting out on the porch of the mess hall talking amongst ourselves when we heard a pack of coyotes howling to the east of us down by the lake.  The coyotes were all yapping and as they moved about the sound followed with them, and it''s my guess that they were running because the sound was moving fast. Then all of sudden, from behind the mess hall we heard this cry that sounded like a group of children moaning/crying in unison and it echoed around us. At that moment the coyotes stopped their yapping/howling. Then just as quickly as it started, the moaning stopped \"mid-echo\".   It was unnatural how it just stopped.  We all just looked at each other and were in awe of what we had just heard.  I had heard that same exact thing when I had last worked at that camp, but it had happened three year earlier.<BR><BR>These were some of the things that happened while we were there.  My boyfriend and I didn''t really think about all things that had happened until we were on our way back to Arizona and had stopped to eat.  It was then that we fully realized we had a bigfoot experience, after all what else could it have been??",

    " I travel, every year on vacation, to South Dakota to do some camping in the Black Hills and have for the past three years camped in the same location. I belong to a club of outdoor enthusiasts, we travel to certain locations to scratch a living from the earth for a few days and once you have the fever there''s no such thing as a nonworking vacation. This last trip (June 2008) I had an experience I couldn''t explain: I was asleep in my tent; I was the only person left in camp everyone else had packed up and left. I wasn''t too concerned as I have camped by myself in this area several times and could only recall one other time when I felt like something was nearby perhaps a cougar or other predator type animal as the crickets stopped chirping and the whole area became extremely quiet. This particular night I was sleeping soundly and was then suddenly awake and aware that something was up, everthing was silent. I didn''t know what had woken me at first but I reached over and checked my watch seeing that it was 3:11am I thought to myself I need to get back to sleep, then I heard it; someone or something was moving around in the stream below my camp. Not directly below, but more to the north and west of my camp following the curvature of the stream. Picture a curving \"L\" shape. Now rotate the \"L\" 1/4 turn to the right, apply that to moving stream water, my camp sits above the water 20 to 30 feet in the inside turn of the \"L\". I heard splashing in the stream and then, SMACK....SMACK. There was a pause of a few seconds then SMACK....SMACK....SMACK. It was two rocks being hit together in a pattern. Ok, creepy and not what I was expecting, I reached over and put a shell in the chamber of my weapon and checked the safety. I''ll give it a few minutes and if nothing else happens I''ll go back to sleep. Nothing else did happen except when the sun came up I packed up and left. The area around the stream is covered in rocks of every size and shape from small pebbles to boulders as big as cars and trucks. I didn''t think to look for tracks. I was still the only one there and I didn''t know what to think, except that if someone thought it was fun to show up at a secluded camp at that time of night to smack rocks together there must be something wrong with them and it''s time to vacate the area.  A few months later I saw a program on primates and how they will knock rocks and sticks together to communicate I put two and two together and realized I may have had an encounter.<BR>",

    " I was visiting my familys former home and treated myself with a nights stay at the cottages. They lie along the road running through from Deadwood to Rochford. The campground was empty save for me, even the proprietor was not home. They have beautiful pastures and a huge assortment of farm life - from turkeys to quail to goats and llamas donkeys and horses.  Their fields run right up to the forest, probably not even a football fields length away. I was sitting outside watching their antics and enjoying the evening air.  Suddenly, something started to howl in the woods to the west. Everything alive on the place froze in that same moment and all of their heads - mine included- swiveled toward the sound. I cannot begin to describe it, but I had grown up in these hills and know it was nothing I could identify.  The sound was somewhere between a howl and a scream and just echoed. It went on for 3-5 minutes, and every creature stopped to listen. I didnt hear it again while there. I didnt tell the proprietor when I saw him next. Since then, Ive listened to recordings to try and identify the sound and the recent recording by the hunter out of Canada is an exact match. Thats what impelled me to report it.",

    " This happened summertime early 70''s (I think 71, 72?).   Me, my husband at the time, and my two brothers hiked into Lilly Pad and Crater Lakes, Stillwater County, Montana.  It borders Custer National Forest, north of the East Fork of Fiddler Creek.  <BR><BR>There were no other cars in the parking lot so absolutely there was no one else up in that area or encountered.  It is a very remote and high mountainous area.  Lilly Pad is full of lilly pads, per its name.  At the time I thought it strange that we didn''t see any moose there. When we left Lilly Pad, we climbed the side of the mountain, a very rocky narrow trail (just a game trail) towards Crater Lake.  Near the top, I kept hearing tree branches break, and thought, huh, the forest sure is noisy.  At the top we stepped into an open plateau (in looking at a current Google map, this area is now forested with trees) . We hadn''t gone far when I heard a very loud tree knock coming from the upper end of the  plateau, on the side of the mountain. I could pinpoint exactly where the sound came from. It was NOT a tree branch falling. It was a wood knock, obviously wood on wood, a very sharp cracking sound, kind of like a baseball bat hitting a ball only LOUD.   <BR><BR>I said, \"What in the world was that?\"  One of my bro''s said \"loggers\".  Wrong, there was no one up in there and there was no evidence of logging.  Almost immediately following that knock I got the feeling we weren''t alone.  <BR><BR>We crossed the plateau and at the end there was a slight curve taking us to the lake. This area was also open but more of a corridor, maybe 100'' or less wide.  <BR><BR>We fished the SE end of the lake and then one by one started making our way up and around the lake on the south side.  When I got towards the upper end there was a horrible stench and my hair literally started to crawl.  I remember being surprised at the smell. Being close to Yellowstone Park I would have expected a sulphur smell but this was not that; it was a stench like I''ve never smelled before or since.   <BR><BR>There was an open area around the lake, maybe 30-50'' or so and then heavy brush.   I hurried up and around the lake back to where the guys were.  My older bro and husband would not go back up around, my younger bro started a second trip.  I had no inclination or want to go back around but then convinced myself if he is going, I must have imagined the feeling.  So I started another round.  Got up there and same thing, the stench made me want to gag (it seemed stronger the second time around) and my hair was standing on end.  I would cast and try to glance behind me to see what was there.  And then pine cones started landing next to me!  I would hear a rustle, and a pine cone would land next to me. These were NOT falling off the trees. The trees were too far away and these were coming in sideways and consistently landing right next to me.  My hair was really crawling. I was terrified.  But I didn''t want to go back towards the guys, it was shorter if I continued around the end and that would put more space between me and it, whatever it was.  I pretended to keep fishing, and glancing over my shoulders afraid if I confronted it, it would attack.  And I kept glancing at the ground for tracks to see if I could figure out what it was.  At first I thought, oh it''s too trampled to tell, and it was, right at the lake edge.  But when I looked towards the bushes and trees right at that upper end, there were 2 sets of huge tracks, one set coming, one evidently going back towards the trees.   The grass there was probably 8-12\" tall and it was smashed down where the footprints were.  I didn''t see the actual foot imprints as in mud, just smashed down grass.  Had I not been so terrified I would have looked for toe prints etc but I was taking fast looks.  And of course expecting tracks like a moose or something, not what I saw.  <BR><BR>At that point I seriously sped up and went around the lake. On the other side there was a place where the lake indented into the trees a bit. I seriously thought about trying to wade across it but it was too deep and I can''t swim, as I did NOT want to go into those trees.  Got back to the guys and they were grabbing their stuff and in a hurry to leave.  I said my skin is crawling up there, my younger bro said, yes there''s something up there.  We headed out and I knew something was watching us.  It shadowed us until we got back off that plateau. I knew as soon as we hit that rocky trail it wasn''t following us anymore.  <BR><BR>Thru the years I have searched my brain as to what it could have been and nothing fit:  grizzly would have been on us, black bear would have either came at us or run, moose wouldn''t smell, mountain lion would watch us but you wouldn''t know it was there and also wouldn''t smell.  Quite frankly there wasn''t an animal that would break tree branches, do a wood knock, or toss pine cones.  Once the bigfoot shows started airing and I heard the eyewitness accounts, I realized what it was.  There simply is no other explanation. I believe there were at least 2 of them, the one breaking the branches and may then have went ahead of us and did the tree knock, possibly to warn a second one that was messing around at the water''s edge.    <BR><BR>My older bro does not remember that trip, my younger bro barely remembers going there. I''m divorced from that husband so who knows what he remembers.<BR><BR>I wish I had had the courage to stand and stare at those bushes longer and even walk towards them, I believe it would have stood up.  <BR><BR>Incidentally there is a recent report with pictures on the BFRO website about a sighting near Red Lodge, Montana, which is relatively close to the area of my encounter.  And somewhere I saw a report of encounters around a \"small town in Carbon County\", a lady and her small daughter would regularly be visited by a family of bigfoots.  The little girl said the small ones don''t smell, just the big ones.  I can''t find that report again but would really be interested if that is close to where I had my encounter.",

However, durring the daylight hours we have been finding many young trees literally being broken which we have numerous pictures of. We are camping in an area which is 9 miles up a dirt road near the Sheep Mountain trailhead. Several of the broken trees that we have been finding are very close to our campsite while others are up and down the road. There has not been any strong winds in this area for well over a week but yet these trees are broken several feet up from the ground which as anyone well knows, is not normal.

I actually saw a hand come around a tree, like you were gripping a tree, or something, but a big furry hand. And being a kid I thought it was a werewolf, the first thing I thought. And I told my buddies and they looked but didn''t see it a first. Not even a moment later a big, I didn''t know what it was, a big furry head stuck around the corner, peeked at us, and went right back. It didn''t charge us and it didn''t move. And then we took off from there like wildfire, just flew out of there. But, that is something we never really talked about because we never knew what it was.<BR><BR>Stan - What year would this have been?<BR><BR>Jim - That would have been in about 1974.<BR><BR>Stan - And in summer?<BR><BR>Jim - Yes, it would be middle of summer. It was just one of those little Forest Reserve cutoffs where you pull-in, and your car is kind of almost in the woods.<BR><BR>Stan - How tall was it?<BR><BR>Jim - I would have to say eight foot range. The hand was up there high, that is what caught me off-guard. <BR><BR>Stan - And what color was it?<BR><BR>Jim - It was a blackish-brown, I just remember seeing a big hand. You would almost mistake it for a gorilla-type thing. It is something that is not natural in Illinois.<BR><BR>Stan - And were you able to see the face?<BR><BR>Jim - Yeah, have you ever played peek-a-boo with the kids? You know how you do that?

Other, less distinct heal prints were seen in an apparent trackway. I think it''s about 15.5 inches long. The print was old, and there was some debris in it. Looks like there may have been some drag as well, but it was rather clear that there were toes. I should say prints, as I found 2 or 3 more heel impressions back from it, with about a 7 foot stride, but they were hard to make out, as other stuff had torn up the trail, so I didn''t photograph them.<BR><BR>I also could make out impressions in the dirt on the trail going in, that looked to have been made by a foot of about the same size. These were barely noticeable in the dirt, but there were three, with about a 7 foot stride. I would venture to say less than a month old, maybe only two weeks. That trail is very packed, and very traveled, so the must have been made just after a good rain. <BR><BR>We did occasionally hear what we thought might have been voices.

A small, abandoned graveyard is nearby, at which various paranormal enthusiasts have a practice of leaving dolls, jewelry, and sweets as offerings to an unnamed infant girl. Deer were plentiful, as two were seen while at the location. There is a medium sized open field (perhaps 5 or 6 soccer fields in size) approximately 1/4 of a mile to the southeast, as the crow flies.

    " Around 11:23pm on june 20th 2006 my girlfriend, myself, and the dog stepped outside on the back porch so my girlfriend could smoke and to let the dog out to go to the bathroom. The porch faces a wooded tree line area that runs in the backyard and runs through the whole subdivison.  So we open the sliding glass door to step out and we all step on to the porch the dog was still. Then she ran barking straight to the back fence, that is just in front of the tree line area, my girlfriend tells her to be quiet and to stop barking.  She doesn''t, then after 5 minutes she stops and we were on our way in, so to see the dog because we couldn''t see her I decide to use the display of my cell phone to see if I could see her, because it is a bright display. I see her coming to it but to joke around with her I start waving it around in circles. Then from the back tree line my girlfriend and I both hear this strange ''coo'' sound with breaks in it. I freak out and push my girlfriend aside and run in the house; as we were inside and I locked the door. Then I say did you her that and she was like yes what was that, I though it had to have been a bigfoot...It was like nothing I have ever heard in my life.  [Edited]",

    " The day was july 2,2011 we decided to go fishing at the kankakee river out in manteno, il. Ive been fishing there for about 10 yrs. just recently about 4 yrs at the new location between the wilmington and momence dam. it was about 11pm  when me and my nephew decided to go and check the lines we had set about 50 yrds or so away from where we had set out chairs and fire. my gf and other nephew stayed behind. this has happened before on past occasions where i have the feeling someone or thing is watching me run my lines at night. i dont make any big fuss about it as i dont want to startle my nephews, or who is with me on that day. this occasion on july 2 2011, i noticed my nephew that was sitting with my girlfriend at the time i was checking lines that he was fueling the fire to get brighter. when we got back he and my gf both said they heard footsteps behind them with brush moving. i paid them no mind as i didnt hear anything. about 10 min later i heard what sounded like someone walking behind us. i asked them to turn off the flash lights and i went and stood in the little path we walk threw in pitch black just watching. and in the distance to my right about 20 or 30 yards i hear a sort of grunt/growl. but i didnt see anyone. as i walked back to my chair and told them to keep there lights off. my nephew asked my other nephew if he keeps farting hes gonna punch him, i told him thats not a fart its to pungent to smell that way. as i have encountered that smell before on previous visits to that site to fish. after that i here a whooping noise noise behind us in the direction i heard the grunt/growl. i always thought it was like a big geese/goose at night, but we have never seen any at night. since ive herd that noise before it didnt bother me none, as ive herd it before. we ran our lines and packed up to leave about 12:30am as the 4 of us are walking out i got that feeling again that someone is following us back to the bridge to our right. again i dont mention it to my nephews or gf as i dont want to startle them of get them worried and panic as there easy to frighten. 2 days later i had seen one of your shows and herd the exact whooping noise that i had herd. and it got me to think what if it is you know! THE SQuatch. i asked my dad if hes ever herd these noises also as hes gone a few time with me fishing and when he herd the whooping noise and the tree knocking in the distance, he confirmed that he has heard that as well. and my dad is a believer but doesnt acknowledge it. He is the type that says things are out there but if you dont believe it it wont happen, if you go messing with it your gonna find yourself getting the you know what scared out of you. i did some digging on your website and found that there has been sightings near that area/town or county.

The fact that he did not get out to see what it was surprised me because my friend is one big dude prob 6.7 250-300lbs.<BR><BR>I told him the ironic thing about this was that everyone else that has spotted bigfoot at the river prob just saw him! he did not think that was very funny.

    " Some friends and I used to like to scare ourselves silly so we used to walk out past the graveyard in town late at night sometimes.  We had a couple strange experiences in a short period of time.  The first time, there were four of us.  We were out very late, close to 3 AM.  We were telling stories and trying to scare each other as we walked past the graveyard.  At one point we stopped and were standing around talking when one of us noticed a very large object in one of the trees.  After sitting and looking for a couple minutes we pointed a flashlight at the thing.  We didn''t see anything clearly, but we didn''t have much time.  It dropped out of the tree, maybe 20'' or more.  It had been resting on a particularly large branch up in a very large tree.  It was gone so fast it didn''t seem possible.  It took off straight to the patch of woods behind the graveyard.  A few hours later, when the sun came up, we went back to the scene.  I have been a hunter and in and out of the woods my whole life and know a thing or two about tracking.  I found impressions in the grass, very large ones.  I tried to match the stride and wasn''t able to come close, neither was my friend who is over 6'' tall.   Later one friend helped me measure my stride at a dead run and my height and I was able to use algebra to determine that the creature must have been between 7-9'' tall.<BR><BR>A second night during the same period one friend and I went to go see if we could see it again but we were stopped by a large Rottweiler that was running loose a couple blocks from the graveyard.  It kept corralling us to the center of the street under the light then turning and barking and growling viciously towards the graveyard.  It would not let us go.  It was quite frightening.  I knew the dog and was disturbed by its actions.  It had never acted that way before.  We were unable to go to the graveyard that night to see anything, though we heard some strange noises that night.<BR>",

    " Was at a creek where I hung out almost every summer with my brothers and friends. Was probably sometime in July,1969. there was a huge tree about 300 ft. from a bridge that went across the creek. Myself and 2 younger brothers were on this bridge on our bikes. I saw something big in that tree 300 ft. away. I kept an eye on it, then I saw something same size as a full grown chimp. About 4 ft. tall, swinging from limb to limb and just playing in the tree. I told my brothers, look at that huge monkey!. We sat and watched it for 5 incredulous minutes. I could''t believe my eyes. All of a sudden, I had this incredible over whelming sense of terror. Didn''t see anything threatening; just felt terrified. I told my brothers we have to go and right now! I made them follow me and on the way up, my middle brother said go fast! There is a man chasing me. he was in the rear of us. We rode as fast as we could about a half mile home and he said it was a strange hairy man chasing us. I think it was a bigfoot protecting its young in the tree. It just chases us off. I didn''t go back to that creek the rest of the summer. Scared me to death. ",

    " When the sighting happened we had come down into a bottom near a stream.  The main thing we first noticed was that the entire woods had gone silent.  Before we had heard bird calls and insects throughout the woods.  The silence was really unsettling and we felt like we were being watched.  We got a little unnerved and began to walk quicker towards where we had parked the car.  As we walked the road back we could hear something about 20-30 feet behind and off to the side of us moving through the brush and undergrowth.  Then at one point we had a rather nasty smell blow through the area, similar to a skunk or fox when they musk or spray.  At one point we know it crossed the road behind us and rather quickly because the noises changed which side of the road they were coming from.  At one point we were certain it was going to walk out into the open right in front of us but then all the sound stopped for a short period of time until we went down the next hill.  When we got ready to go around the last bend to where we had parked I took a look back and saw \"something\" squatting on a point next to a dead blackened tree which stood  around three to four feet tall.  The top of it came to right around the top of the dead tree and it was fairly wide.  The only thing I could misidentify it as was a black bear and they haven''t been seen in our area for well over 50-100 years.  I caught a quick glance at it and then turned back around told my friend I saw something and to just keep walking quickly straight ahead and for the car.  Once we got around the bend we ran for the car, jumped in and took off.  Since then we''ve never really talked about it.",

    " In 1953 I was a 10 year old girl living in George Field (Barracks), IL. George Field was a WWII air base for pilot training & the barracks housed airmen and brass. After the war the Barracks were converted to civilian apartments & my family lived in one. George Field was in an extremely remote area between Vincennes, Indiana & Lawrenceville, Illinois. The Wabash River was east close to Vincennes and the Embrass River was west - the rivers approximately 20-30 miles apart. The Barracks were surrounded by miles of corn and wheat fields.<BR><BR>Often during the night I heard high pitched screams like a woman being attacked or killed. My parents told me the screams were panthers  I never saw any panthers. My sisters and I walked the corn and wheat fields as often as we could. Old timers told us to be careful of the Grassman which I later learned was their name for Big Foot. I thought Grassman was like the Wizard of Oz Scarecrow.<BR><BR>One night my parents went out and left me with my older sister (who has since passed away). She was always teasing, aggravating and pulling pranks on anyone foolish to fall for her drama! That night she came close and said to me Judy, there is something outside the window. Seriously, there is a monster outside came to the window  listen, you can hear it. To shut her up I moved to the window and listened. (Our windows were usually open because we had no air-conditioning)<BR><BR>I could hear something large moving around and saw a large head in the shadows. It walked around all the windows trying to look in and went from the back of the house to the front. Meanwhile, our middle sister came home  I knew shed be coming in the front door where the monster was. I gathered all my nerve, opened the front door, turned on the porch light and screamed to my sister there was danger out there. I found myself looking eyeball to eyeball with the Monster. I am now 71 years old and know it was Bigfoot, which I didnt know at the time.<BR><BR>It had honey blonde hair and beautiful amber colored eyes. We startled each other, but it had an Oh Shit look on its face. My sister who had just returned home came running toward it and it turned to leave. My sister and I looked at each other for a second and Bigfoot was gone  disappeared instantly.<BR><BR>Neither I nor my two sisters ever talked about it  we all forgot it  never told our parents or anyone. <BR><BR>My memory of this incident never came back. 61 years later I started watching your T.V. show Finding Bigfoot  Ive always had an interest in these creatures. It was like someone threw a switch and I remembered. I asked mys sister if she remembered anything and it came back to her. She remembered me screaming and also her chasing this Bigfoot thing. She said she chased it because I was hysterical and scared to death. I asked her if she ever told our parents or anyone and she said no, she had also forgotten about it. How can this be after 61 years? I think we were both so terrified our minds simply suppressed what wed seen and your T.V. show was the trigger that restarted my memory.",

Watching a few cars pass the house.  To my left was the farmhouse, to my right was the driveway and a few out buildings plus tall weeds (about 4 feet tall) in an old pasture. Several feet behind me was the pole light and machine shed. I felt an eerie sensation to my right.  I looked in that direction.  I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me.  I could have sworn I saw an outline of a head and shoulders above the weeds.  I continued to look in that direction and shrugged it off as my imagination.  I went back to texting.  Glancing to the same spot occasionally. I kept hearing a slight noise to my right. And I would look up. Out of the corner of my eye I saw a rolling limestone rock.  I didn''t think about it at first.  Then I realized that rocks don''t move by themselves.  I was freaked out and went inside. The next morning I went to investigate what could have formed the shape I saw.  Nothing was there.  I did find several sticks, corn stocks, and dirt clods in the driveway. ",

    " [Witness first names have been changed] On Tuesday evening June 28, 2011, I along with fellow paranormal investigator James arrived at the Cumberland Sugar Creek Cemetery in rural Sangamon County near the small town of Glenarm, Illinois a little before 10:00pm.<BR><BR>James and I are both paranormal investigators and had previously talked about trying to find the cemetery to check it out for a possible paranormal investigation. Upon finding the location, we decided to do a quick walk through of the cemetery to see if anything of a paranormal nature was occurring and to check out the cemetery''s layout.<BR><BR>We also had heard from other local paranormal sources that a group of paranormal investigators had been pelted with rocks or dirt clods thrown from the tree line around the cemetery. This occurred less than one week ago and during a paranormal investigation. We had also heard of several recent sightings of large tracks or foot prints in the Covered Bridge area of rural Sangamon County which is not far from the cemetery. <BR><BR>James and I both felt that the throwing of stones sounded like classic Squatch activity and because of this we decided to check the tree line around the cemetery to look for possible signs of what may have been throwing the stones at the paranormal group.<BR><BR>This is when we found the following.<BR><BR>In the Southeast corner of the cemetery property and next to an opening in the fence line, we found a mound of fairly soft clay. As we were looking around the mound of dirt, we noticed what looked like a fairly large foot print. Upon further examining the foot print, it was apparent that whatever had been walking there was barefoot. In the same proximity we discovered two other footprints which were approximately the same size. We estimated the size of the prints to be at least fourteen inches long. The footprints were also barefoot.<BR><BR>The tracks were headed away from the cemetery and towards the southeast. Because we had not planned on doing anything more than a walkthrough of the cemetery we did not have our usual camera and lighting equipment with us, so we took several photos of the footprints with James cell phone camera. We also noticed that approximately 75 feet or so and to the North of the footprints a fairly good sized tree of maybe 3 to 4 inches in circumference had been snapped and bent over. The tree was located next to but outside of the fence.<BR><BR>The area surrounding the cemetery is rural, the cemetery itself has a fence around the rear part of the graveyard however the best that we could tell in the darkness is that it looked like there was an open field to the rear of the cemetery and it appeared that on the other side of the open field there may be more substantial tree coverage. But unfortunately due to the darkness and lack of lighting equipment, we could not determine any further details of the surrounding terrain.<BR><BR>We then left the cemetery around 11:00pm. <BR>",

    " The following on-site interview was conducted by Stan Courtney.  The first name of the witness has been changed.  <BR><BR>Stan - How long have you been coming to this location?<BR><BR>John - A couple months now.<BR><BR>Stan - What type of experiences have you had here?<BR><BR>John - Well, everytime I''ve been out here, including the first time, I wasn''t out here very long, we started hearing wood knocking all around us in the woods. And in different areas, it was like it surrounded us. And along with the woodknocking we heard what sounded like logs being thrown, usually like heavy chunks of wood tossed.<BR><BR>Stan - How many different locations would you say that was, two or three?<BR><BR>John -  Oh no, I would say 10 to 20, it surrounds the area. It''s almost like there are several of them.<BR><BR>Stan - Did you feel like it was being done in relationship to you being here?<BR><BR>John  - Yes, I felt like something was protecting the area, and it didn''t want us to go into the woods. It seemed like the woods was its area and it wanted to let us know it was in there and to stay out,  that is what I got the feeling of. I got the feeling of fear to go into woods.<BR><BR>Stan - Have you had the feeling of being watched?<BR><BR>John - Oh definitely, all the time, it''s like a set of eyes are on you constantly. I''m feeling it right now in fact.<BR><BR><img src=\"http://investigators.bfro.net:270/media/28144a.jpg\"><BR>[ The small rural cemetery in Shelby County, Illinois]<BR><BR>Stan - What were you telling me about the large cat you saw here?<BR><BR>John - I did not see the cat personally, we have heard from the neighbors that there have been a lot of large cat sightings here, including in one tree in this cemetery. We have heard deep cat-like, growl like the little growl they do in the back of their throat, we have heard that twice out here, at two different locations inside the woods. We have heard hissing out here, but we also have heard curding yells, of which I don''t know what they were. But, I am an avid hunter and I''ve never heard anything like it.<BR><BR>Stan - Were they loud?<BR><BR>John - They were fairly loud.<BR><BR>Stan - Did they sound cat-like?<BR><BR>John - No this wasn''t cat like. This was more of a human-like sound coming from the chest cavity type yell. <BR><BR>Stan - And how far away from you? <BR><BR>John - I would say 200 yards back off in the woods. We heard those in the same area where something had charged through there and it was something very, very large and it stopped when it got right to the edge of the cemetery. It just like stopped before it stepped foot in the cemetery and we never heard again. We never heard it go back in, it just vanished and we never saw anything either, but it was something big coming through the woods. It was definitely like a bluff charge, but at the time we thought something was going to come out and plow us so I guess what ever it was, was a bluff charge. <BR><BR>Stan - And what about the screams?<BR><BR>John - Actually they were on separate occasions, the screams were about a week apart, different times. The night I heard the charge is the night we heard wood knocking in the woods back in the same area of the cemetery. I picked up a walnut and I threw it into the trees, and you could hear it going through the trees, I was a baseball player, I threw it quite a ways, you could hear it going for quite awhile. And I would say a good five seconds later that walnut got thrown back and landed three feet in front of my toes. It spooked me pretty bad. But there is nothing in the woods that can throw a walnut back at me. <BR><BR>Stan - Any other unusual sounds?<BR><BR>John - Yes, there are several other sounds that you can''t identify out here, it throws you off guard, you hear them briefly. We''ve heard some grunts out here, and they''re not deer grunts. There is no animal native to Illinois that grunts, they are pretty low but they are definitely a grunt. We''ve heard a series of three grunts in a row is the best ones we''ve heard. And it happened to be in the same corner that that thing charged us and I got the walnut thrown at me.  But like I said it seems to surround the cemetery and makes you think there are several of these things and they are protectors, they are protecting their home, whatever they are.<BR><BR>Stan - When you come out does something usually happen?<BR><BR>John - Every time, I have not been out here when something didn''t happen. Which tells me, I just get the overwhelming feeling \"Don''t go into the woods\". I don''t know why, I think they protect the woods, I think they''re saying it''s okay to be out here, but don''t come into the woods. The thing that baffles me is that when you hear wood knocks or the logs being thrown and when I heard that thing charge, you never hear anything running off or footsteps going with it. It''s there and then it''s just gone. It''s like they glide or something and I know if it was a natural animal I would hear it. I am an avid hunter, I deer hunt, one of the biggest animals in Illinois woods is deer. We know if is the deer and even one deer can sound like a herd of elephants coming through sometimes. And these, whatever this is not making noises when it''s moving, it''s moving very sneakily, it is very intellegent in my opinion.<BR><BR>Stan - Have you ever heard them going through the woods when they are making a lot of noise?<BR><BR>John - No, it is always sporadic wood knocking, it can be one second we hear it here and then the second after that we hear it clear across the cemetery. It is like they are communicating somehow, and they are saying \"Ok, I knocked, now you go ahead and knock\", and letting us know they have the whole area covered. You get that feeling that you are being watched and also surrounded at the same time.<BR><BR>Stan - Well maybe that will happen tonight?<BR><BR>John - I highly expect it to.<BR><BR>Stan - Thank you John for allowing me to accompany you to this location and for allowing me to do this interview.<BR><BR>John - Thank you Stan.<BR><BR><BR><BR>",

    " This was circa 1978. As my friend and I were walking from his house along his 1/4 mile driveway that meandered through the woods along side of the creek we had heard some odd noises that caught our attention. At this point, we had been running through the woods for a few years together, felt extremely comfortable in them and knew many sounds and sign. Neither of us could identify these sounds. I do not recall the sounds exactly, but, it seemed to be some tapping noise, somewhat subtle and not alarming, yet it seemed clearly something out of the ordinary. So we decided to hop the old overgrown fence which paralleled the driveway, penetrate the overgrowth and go into the woods to investigate. <BR><BR>Heading in the direction from which the sounds had been coming we soon noticed that some of the patches of grass that had managed to grow under the canopy of trees was matted down. The matting looked quite fresh as all the blades were still quite green and showing no signs of atrophy or recovery. While clearly other patches of grass nearby were exactly as one would expect, not matted down. We then spread out a little bit as we normally did when investigating the woods. <BR><BR>Shortly after this I spotted a footprint, classic human shape with five toes, in some dried mud. Clear as day, there it was. Unlike the fresh appearance of the matted grass, this had been here awhile as the \"mud\" which had originally received the print was now thoroughly dry.  I called my friend over while I looked at it thinking, this doesn''t make any sense, who else would be back here and why would they be barefooted? <BR><BR>We again spread out and now I was head down and focused on finding more foot prints. Shortly thereafter, I heard a crash in the trees and my friend yelled, \"Run, run for your life!\" <BR><BR>And maybe it was this comment that etched the memory of that day firmly onto the memory banks. I could tell in my close friends voice that he was dead serious. For that matter, he was never a BSer anyway. I lit out of there, running through the underbrush, past trees and hopped the old fence at a faster pace before or probably since. Reaching the relatively safety of the clearing the driveway offered and turned and yelled encouragements for my friend to get out of there. I could see him now, emerging from the underbrush, the expressions on his face said this was no joke. Just as I saw him begin to emerge and before he hopped the fence a large crash of breaking timber happened from directly behind him. <BR><BR>Although overgrowth was relatively dense, I could see he wasn''t causing the sounds of the smashing logs. Something had apparently broken a good sized tree or log directly behind him. There was no mistaking the sound of it, or the movement in the undergrowth behind him and to his right, but, what it was remained shrouded by the forest growth.  He made it across the fence and upon reaching where I was apprehensively standing, snapped back around and we stood shoulder to shoulder peering into the forest both uncertain of what exactly had just happened.  <BR><BR>I do know these to be certain:<BR> <BR>Fact: Unidentified sounds were coming from the woods.<BR> <BR>Fact: The grass had the appearance of being freshly matted <BR> <BR>Fact: There was what looked to be a human footprint completely intact and showed the entire outline of a foot with five toes. It seemed only 10-12 inches long <BR> <BR>Fact: Something or somebody was smashing up some decent sized logs and it wasn''t us.<BR> <BR>Fact: Somebody who doesn''t scare easy was sure spooked that day.<BR> <BR>Fact: An Illinois State Trooper came out that day to investigate our story. The trooper seemed to lose interest when my friend said that whatever he saw was about 7'' tall. <BR> <BR>The Unknown:<BR> <BR>Was it a hippy, hillbilly or prankster who simply liked to walk barefooted around woods that had old rusty barbed wire among other occasional rusty or sharp artifacts? Or was it a Bigfoot? This remains the unknown. <BR>",

    " I was just outside and my 3 yearold lab was spooked by somethig like I''ve never seen. Barking--in a fear sound-- and running in circles! Wind is in the west and that is the direction of her concern.<BR>Only other time I''ve seen this was 2 years ago when she was spooked smelling the air. I could smell it too.<BR>It was like the worst locker room smell mixed with road kill. It took her 3-4 days to settle down. Tom<BR><BR><BR>The witness first contacted the BFRO with this report on June 23, 2011. On July 19, 2011, I met with him at his house. I interviewed the witness that day and had him explain what types of things he had been experiencing. Since then, this location has been the site of an on-going investigation with a long-term audio recorder left in the woods near his house. I interviewed the witness again in late October 2011, and the content of the two interviews follows:<BR><BR>The first name of the witness has been changed. <BR><BR>Stan - When was the first time something happened that you didnt understand.<BR><BR>Tom  It was a year ago, so it was probably early June of 2010. It was a Saturday, a friend had stopped by. When I am outside my dog Lulu roams the property, sometimes she will go back into the tree-line but she usually stays close to me. At one oclock in the afternoon we were in the shop talking and doing stuff. When he was getting ready to leave I called for her. She was real nervous, her tail was tucked. There was a light breeze from the south and she was facing towards the south and acting very unusual.<BR><BR>Tom - I figured it was a deer, a coyote, something back there. I walked back a little ways and she wouldnt move, she just stayed here by the side door, very nervous. I finally said, lets go in. My friend had left. I opened the door and had to raise my voice to get her to come in, which was unusual because she always wants to stay right near me. So I raised my voice and she came in and she ran straight down the steps into the basement and hid. I first thought when she went down that she was looking for a toy or something. After ten minutes I went down and found her, she was hiding behind the furniture in an unused room, cowering, and I reached down and she wouldnt come to me. I reached down to touch her and she was shaking.<BR><BR>Tom - I made her come back up for awhile and then we went back outside and repeated the same thing five or six times to about  8 oclock that night. We had Lady Asian bugs and I am apparently sinus sensitive to them and that night around 9 oclock I got my sinuses cleared up and we stepped out that side door, still had a breeze from the south, and she instantly panicked and went into that cowering motion, still shaking and standing low, not up like a dog does.<BR><BR>Tom - I stood there and thought about it for a little bit and got a good whiff of it. The best description I have is that it was like the worst locker room stench or sweaty clothes that sat in a hamper for two weeks mixed with maybe road kill, bloody violent. It stood the hair up on my back. I sat back and thought wow, the trees are two hundred feet away, what is back there that smells so bad. And at the time she laid down in the yard, facing the south and was real nervous. She would look over her should behind her and then she would get up and face the other way because the wind currents were changing and she kept doing that. So we went back in for the night.<BR><BR>Tom - Next morning I got up and went to church and breakfast, came home, got dressed and walked back in there. She walked with for a ways and then she turned and ran back up here to the house.<BR><BR>Tom  From that time on there have been few deer and coyotes around. Prior to that I could see deer most every morning out back or down the roads. I think I have only seen one deer on my property in a year. Last night was the second time Ive heard coyotes in a year. And usually if I grilled chicken out they would be howling, they would smell it and theyd be singing.<BR><BR>Stan  After that initial time did you smell it again last year?<BR><BR>Tom  I never noticed it again. About a week before, my nephew called and said there are footprints in a subdivision south of Chatham. I said that bugs me because a few days ago she (Lulu) was out back behind the brown shed barking in defense and I stepped out to see what she was doing. She had her nose up, she was following the wind currents I think, because she was running in circles, tail was tucked and she was real nervous. And I called her and she looked towards me, like she was ready to come to me and then she would jump like something spooked her, an animal, like you through a rock at her.  She did that for a couple of days when we were out. It was in the west that time and she was facing west.<BR><BR>Stan  Have you ever felt like you were being watched?<BR><BR>Tom   Yes, just about every time I see her doing something like that, a few times Ive been outside, I get that feeling.<BR><BR>Stan  Have you ever had anything thrown at you, like rocks or anything.<BR><BR>Tom  No.<BR><BR>Stan  What about sounds?<BR><BR>Tom  Last night, it was probably after 10, I think it was 10:30 or so I had been watching TV and I noticed she was restless in the house. I asked her once Do you have to go potty? Usually she would come up to me and she would give me a Ruff and we would go. She wouldnt do that last night, she just looked at me like keep guessing. About 10:30 I said Come on lets go potty and then well go to bed. We stepped outside and she immediately faced south and froze and I got the feeling while she was doing that that somebody was starring at me.<BR><BR>Tom  So I stepped back in, grabbed my cellphone and my big spotlight and she was still outside. I stepped outside and started walking south towards the treeline, but she stayed right by that door. Now normally a dog will follow its master, and I got about half way between the pool and the treeline and stopped and stood there a little bit. And I could hear (it was real quiet you could hear crickets) stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp. My hair stood up, I thought What in the world is walking in twigs and branches? And I said Whos there? and I stopped, and Im thinking a couple of my friends know and are they pulling a prank? And then I think I said it again Whos there? like that.<BR><BR>Tom  And I waited and there was a Whoo-oo sound like that came back at me, probably not that loud because it knew I could hear it whatever it was. Right after that, west of here, and I would say a good half mile coyotes started screaming and yelling. Now, I dont need to be out here alone, I dont have a gun, I dont have a knife. My dog was spooked, she was staying up at the house. So, I came back in, started turning the light off, fifteen, twenty minutes passed.<BR><BR>Tom  I have a little sound amplifier and headset and you can adjust the volume. I went quietly out onto the deck, left her inside, and I sat for fifteen or twenty minutes listening. I could hear some footsteps same interval steps that was west of me now back in the trees. I said There is something back there, but Im not going to go look after dark not when its something powerful.<BR><BR>Tom  Anyway when I came in from that I went to check email and Facebook was up with the link for Chatham for the story they just published in the paper about footprints and Messing With Sasquatch.<BR><BR>Stan  So did you hear any other vocals.<BR><BR>Tom  After I heard the footsteps and I called out and it made the sound back I started walking back up to the house. I heard what sounded like children playing and they werent very far away, like a couple of little girls giggling or talking. Now there are no kids back there, I know there cant be. The next house is a half mile down the road or so. My dog Lu, started out to me and I said Who is that? and she froze and came right back to the house when she heard it again.<BR><BR>Stan  So it sounded like kids playing?<BR><BR>Tom  Like little girls talking or playing.<BR><BR>Stan  No crying, more as a conversation?<BR><BR>Tom  I dont know how I would describe it, it wasnt <BR>understandable, it wasnt I want that toy. It was a whining, high pitched voice like a little girls would be.<BR><BR>Stan  Thank you for allowing me to interview you Tom.<BR><BR>Tom  You are welcome Stan.<BR><BR>On Sunday, October 23, 2011, the witness had an unusual experience at his home and the next morning found a large footprint outside his living room window. He took pictures with a tape measure along the footprint. Tom was also able to see all the toes in the loose dirt. But it''s always difficult for photographs of footprints to show very much detail. My interview with Tom concerning this incident follows:<BR><BR>Tom  I have an L-shaped couch and I am sitting on one end of it, the other end is under a window, and that window is on the east side of my house. We are watching the World Series, it was probably around 9:30 and Lulu, my dog, raised her head and then looked at me with big eyes like Did you hear that? And then she turns and looks at the window and I go Yeah, I heard it. And I said Go ahead and get down. So she got down, came out on the floor and laid down so she could watch the window.<BR><BR>Tom  And we heard the noise several more times, and she got up wandered around the house and smelled floor, and walls and was just nervous.<BR><BR>Tom  Then the next morning we went outside and there was a footprint out there. Now let me back up a little bit, Friday I pulled some rose bushes and raked the landscaping right there next to the house, so it was all fresh. So, that footprint happened I believe Sunday night. Now this scenario where she is on the couch and we hear this noise, this has happened seven or eight different times this summer.<BR><BR>Stan  Can you describe the sound.<BR><BR>Tom  It just sounds like a creak, like somebody is leaning against the wall on the outside. And Ive got vertical blinds and theyre turned to block the light where I am sitting but when you are outside you can look and see the TV if you are tall. I cant see the TV when I am outside. I am six foot tall. So for someone to look in that window has to be more than six foot tall.<BR><BR><img src=\"http://www.bfro.net/flatsfiles/29612b.jpg\"><BR><BR>Right footprint found the 24th of October 2011 showing a length of 14 inches.<BR><BR>Stan  I know you had a ruler next to the footprint, how long did you think it was?<BR><BR>Tom  It is 14 inches long.<BR><BR>Stan  And the width was?<BR><BR>Tom  7 inches wide. And the footprint is curved, it almost looks like a broken foot or something, I dont know how to describe it, but its not straight like ours. Where ours has an arch this looks like the footprint is curved.<BR><BR>Stan  Thank you for allowing me to interview you Tom.<BR><BR>Tom  You are welcome Stan.<BR><BR><img src=\"http://www.bfro.net/flatsfiles/29612a.jpg\"><BR><BR>Right footprint found the 24th of October 2011 showing a width of 7 inches.<BR><BR>",

    " I have had several experiences over the years near my home. Five years ago I was picking blackberries on the back side of my property, late June. To the east of the blackberry vines is a farm field.  The field was planted in corn and there was a strip of last years corn reside at the edge of the field, old stubble, hard to walk through with boots on. There were a series of  footprints coming out of the field, moving towards the woods. There were five prints, about my size, mens 11 or 12, bare foot, wide with no arch, flat footed. I go barefoot a lot, but no one in their right mind walks through a corn field with stubble in it barefoot.<BR><BR>Four years ago, my son and I were in my bedroom, watching videos on my computer about six in the evening when something passed by my cabin and beat on the wall as it went by. Scared us to death. The pounding started near the corner of the room we were in, near the ceiling. This is a good ten feet above the ground level outside. The second hit was in the other corner of the room, the third hit sounded like it came from above the window in the den and the fourth and fifth hits were on the bathroom wall. Quick, BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM! I live in a log cabin and it literally shook the house. Next morning I looked around outside, no prints and nothing on the logs. It was in July/August. Ground was dry and hard. I have ruled out the house settling, small animals, birds, etc. No idea what it was.<BR><BR>This year, May/June 2012 about ten thirty at night I was getting ready for bed, my son was in the bathroom. We both heard a low, very guttural grunt, HOOO outside the house. My son is eighteen years old and a large muscular young man but he came out of the bathroom pulling up his jeans and looking scared.  We ran out onto the porch in time to see something large, dark, and low to the ground run past my neighbors house. Truthfully, it looked like a gorilla running flat out on all fours. It activated my neighbor''s motion sensor lights in front of his home and about thirty seconds later the coyotes on the other side of the highway went nuts. It was moving, quarter of a mile in just under a minute. The next day my father said he also heard the grunt, it woke him up.",

    " I was driving on Veterans Parkway in Springfield. Heading north at 60 mph. There is a heavly wooded area with a pond in the area also. It is a four lane highway with two lanes going south and two going north divided by a grassy medium. It was 2 a.m. and I was the only vehicle on the road, nothing else in sight. Then about 200 yards ahead of me I noticed something moving across the two southbound lanes. At first I thought it was a deer, since I see them frequently. <BR><BR>So I hit my bright lights and saw it was something bigger than a deer. At my speed of 60 mph, no way it should have been gone when I reached the area where it crossed the road. It seemed to move effortlessly cross the road, in only a few strides. <BR><BR>I was in amazement not knowing what it was. I know for a fact  it wasnt a deer. And this is not bear country, it wasn''t a horse or a dog, wolf, coyote or any other animal familiar to this area. Then I wondered if it could have been the elusive BIG-FOOT.<BR><BR>When I saw it I hit my bright lights, it had two legs and it was hunched over like it had long arms draggin right above the road. It moved so fast, not like a human or an animal and I''ve seen animals cross the road but this was big steps.<BR><BR>Where I saw it, the area is very damp and has lots of deer. Its close to the water and sewer treatment. And if you know the area you know the foul smell. Good for a bigfoot. I wish I could have been more ready for it but I was like stunned.

    " On Friday, July 28th- my 15 year old son was visiting his grandparents on the Lake of Egypt in Marion, Illinois. After dark he remembered that he didn''t take the battery off the charger on the bass boat so he headed down the hill toward the dock. Since it was very dark, he brought along his 10 million candlepower spot light. <BR><BR>He went down to the lake and started taking the charger off the battery. He decided to shine his light on the other side of the cove to look for raccoons or turtles or coyotes or deer, whatever he might be able to see. <BR><BR>He looked to a point off the cove and noticed a big black figure or \"glob\" in the 6 or 7 foot tall grass. He realized it was not something that he had seen during his visit while fishing (for 2 weeks prior). He flashed his flashlight on and off to get it''s attention so it would look at him. He wanted to see what kind of eyes it had. He whistled to get it''s attention - and put the light back on and heard a different whistle back. My son looked up top of the hill toward the house to see if his grandparents were playing a trick on him and no one was there. So he instantly flashed back to the spot where the creature was standing. He saw it starting to move away and he noticed the tops of the weeds moving as it left. He was creeped out and ran back up to the house- because it was to big for a deer or coyote.",

We were going really slow because of deer at night, so while me and the boy we conversing on and off there from my side of the road comes a maybe 7 foot creature with the most beautiful chestnut long hair that covered all of its body just jogging across the front of my car crossing over the headlights. It used no effort to cross but it sure did cover allot of land in a very short time. Me and the boy watched it cross the car and go into the woods: then we looked at each other and kinda screamed, shouted to each other: Did you just see that? We answered each other at the same time and then I told the boy lets drive down the way and see if we can catch up to it, so we did, but to no avail. He had disappeared.

    " It was midsummer of 1990, I was living alone in a mobile home in the woods adjoining Shawnee National Forest. I decided to go for a walk in the woods because I was bored and was thinking about shooting my rifle a bit. Nothing special, just what I normally did as a youth (since I''m not much of a people person I spent a lot of my youth in the woods). I was walking up a field road that passed thru a patch of woods that led to a larger feild on top of a hill a few hundred feet away. As I got halfway up the hill, I was suddenly shocked by a very loud whistle that was quickly followed by a scream that I had heard many times before as a kid.<BR><BR>I knew from previous experience that I didn''t want to hang around even though I was \"armed to the teeth\". I was 19 going on 20 at the time and I''ve spent the majority of my youth spending time alone in the woods, hunted almost everything in the area that could be legally hunted, so I know what the normal sounds of the woods are, and no, it wasn''t a swine, bear , coon, or any other such creature. The scream I heard instantly filled me with fear even though I had an 8mm Hakim Mauser, 12 ga. shotgun, and a 22 cal. pistol. I always went hunting heavily armed because I have stumbled across sasquatch a few times before and decided that next time I''d be more prepared.<BR><BR>I was about halfway up the hill when I heard the scream a few ridges over (1/2-3/4mi away from me). I quickly turned and decided to call it a night, as I was walking down the hill, I heard another scream at the top of the hill I was walking down (either they can run like hell or there were two). Before I got to the bottom of the hill, I then decided that although I had a lot of weapons and ammo, this wasn''t anything that I wanted to shoot alone at night with only a maglite taped to my barrel. I figured running for the road would take too long and a more direct route would be better, so I cut across the field and jumped the creek behind my house. I guess I didn''t notice till after I had crossed the creek, but it had followed me home (which wasn''t far, maybe a few hundred yards). I can tell you that to keep up with a terrified 20yr old running faster than ever before, that thing had to be extremely fast. I stood by the back porch and could hear its heavy breathing and growling. It sounded kinda like a horse that had just run till it was winded, but the breathing wasn''t labored. It was breathing in a normal rhythmic tone, not labored.<BR><BR>I was terrified because even after firing a few rounds in it''s direction I could still \"feel\" it''s presence and hear it, so I unloaded in that direction.<BR><BR>I fired over 100 shells thru the Hakim, a full box of shells from the 12ga. and every shell I had for my 22 before I ran in the house to grab more ammo and turn some more lights on.<BR><BR>I must''ve shot around 150 or more shells, I figured that I had shot at it enough and wanted to save what ammo I had left in case it decided to try to come in for a visit durring the night, so I went in the house and stayed awake all night. The next day(about noon) I decided to go see what I hit. When I crossed the creek I could plainly see where I had fired because of the holes in the trees and the saplings that were broken from bullets. Found no blood, no footprints(it was dry) but I did find something I didnt expect...it had laid down when I began shooting and must''ve been there for a while because there was a flattened area that looked like a deer bed. Although deer do frequent the area, I sincerely doubt it was deer, because there was no scat, and deer scat alot in and around their beds, as well as it was a good 1/4 mi. from the nearest deer trail. I''m an experinced woodsman, and I have never run across a creature that was smart enough to lay down and stay put while bullets were flying over it''s head...animals just don''t have the reasoning it would take to exert that type of behavior.<BR><BR>Like I said, I never saw it, I just heard it and heard it''s foot falls, it was absolutely two legged, it was huge, and I don''t think it wanted to say hello. Not sure what it wanted, but it was definately very intelligent. That was the only event of this nature during the time I lived there(6yrs.)...oh yeah, I don''t remember smelling it''s body funk till after I had started shooting, maybe it wasn''t close enough for me to smell it or I was just to scared, either way, I hope this info helps your investigation.",

    " The first Tuesday of August 2011 I was pulling up to a hunting area, I had parked the car and was getting ready to get out and get my gear. It was a little bit after 4 o''clock in the morning because I had just dropped my wife off at work so it was still two hours before sunup.<BR><BR>So, I was sitting there, getting ready to get my gear when all of a sudden a just got this chill all over me, the hair stood up on the back of my neck, my arms, and something inside just told me \"don''t get out of the car\". <BR><BR>So I sat there, I drank a 16 oz Full Throttle energy drink, so with my kidney problems in the past, kidney stones, when I have to go I have to go or my kidneys start hurting. So I finally broke down and stepped out of the car, I didn''t even step completely out of the car, I was between the car and the door. I caught this brief scent that smelt skunky and musky. But it was really, really light so I didn''t really think a whole lot about it. I didn''t have a flashlight shining around at the time because I didn''t think I would be in the woods long before the sun would come up. I figured I would go out there and catch an hour or two nap before the sun came up.<BR><BR>So, I got back in the car and an hour later I had to relieve myself again. I got out, I didn''t hear anything, I didn''t see anything and this time I didn''t smell anything. So I relieved myself and got back in the car. I waited for sunup, where it started getting light enough so you could see where you are going. I walked down the trail to this pond, which is on the north side of the fire access road. And I sat there for about fifteen, twenty minutes and I came back up to the road and I started walking east on the fire access road. I came across this turkey scratch in the middle of the gravel pad, it was hard packed with a light dust on it.<BR><BR>And there was a beautiful track, the toes were visible. I took a picture of it with my hunting boot which is a 10 EEE beside it for comparison. It was so fresh in that dust the picture showed up really good. However, when I went back the next day due to the wind the track was no longer visible because the dust is so light, which tells me it was an extremely fresh track because you can see from the photo that the track is plainly visible with very good definition considering the dusting ground that it was on. <BR>",

    " I was in So. Illinois visiting my Grandmother and sister on my Grandmothers farm located in the Shawnee Nat. Forest.  I grew up on this property and lived there for about 23 years.  While living in this area I have heard and seen a vast assortment of wild animals.  The National Forest Service has released many different animals into the Shawnee National which has given me a good opportunity to hear, see, and also track different wild animals.  <BR><BR>I have either heard or see bears, turkeys, bobcats, cougars, owls, fox, beavers, coyotes, opossums, racoons, hawks, buzzards, crows, ducks, geese, rabbits, squirrels, and lots of deer.  On this night my wife and I were going to sit on the front porch with my Grandmother and sister when we started to hear a sound that raised the hair on the back of my neck and as I type this out I get that feeling all over again.  I have NEVER heard a sound like this before.  It was to say the least very frightning.  I do believe that yeties do exist but did not believe that one would be anywhere near Southern Illinios.  We continued to hear the sound which sounded like a calling that started out low pitched and ended out in a higher pitch that had somewhat of a human characteristic to it.  It was continueous for about 5 to 8 min. The only other thing we could hear was neighbor''s dogs going bezerk!  Everything else was absoulutely quiet.  <BR><BR>My Grandmother looked at me and asked if it was human and I said definatly no. It was without a doubt the eeriest and scariest sound I have ever heard.  I estimate it to have been about a quarter of a mile away and maybe closer.  It was at that time that I regreted not taking the time to bring my sidearm with me.  My Grandmother, sister, wife and myself stood in general disbelief of what we were hearing.  None of the witnesses have ever heard a sound like this before.  In carefull reflection of that night and replaying the sound over in my head, I would have to say that if asked what it was I would say it was a Yeti.  As far as hard evidence I have none.  I had to leave that night and have to been back to look over the land to see if I could find anything.",

    " The Backpack trip<BR>Draft 9-8-2014<BR> <BR>Background:  Biologist at a major biotech company.  No previous experience with Sasquatch or similar, but have seen a couple shows on television (1 episode of finding BF, and one episode of Survivorman). The Survivorman version was more honest in the I dont know what that was category and peeked my interest; later reminded me of the structure I saw on the ravine trail here.  I have many years camping experience, and some deer and turkey hunting, and grew up summers playing Danl Boone in the woods, so I am pretty comfortable in the woods normally.  After this, I really have no interest in chasing BF  but would go there again only if I had a few capable buddies together for security.  <BR> <BR>On August 31st, I went on a solo backpacking trip on the Wilderness Trail at Meramec State Park in eastern Missouri.  The trail traversed a ~10 mile loop through the ~7,000 acres of protected wilderness with backpack campsites scattered along the exterior circumference of the loop.  <BR> <BR>I started at the main trailhead at the MSP Cabins parking lot, traveling counterclockwise along the route.  I was on the trail at 4PM sharp, a sunny day with chance of evening thunderstorms, highs in the mid 80s.  Trail goes through a heavily forested area, typical Eastern white oak, hickory, with understory trees and shrubs, poison oak, etc.   significant areas of the trail were overgrown and thick annual weedy undergrowth, and many creek crossings (soil is moist under the rocks, but almost no areas with clean free-flowing water).  After fifty yards or so there is a trail-use sign-in box; the box was pretty full of hiker slips so I gathered the rangers do not check it often.  Heading clockwise, campsites 1&2 are about  mile in, and about 3.5 miles are campsites 3&4.  I ran into two people (day hikers) on their way out near the sign-in box.  Human sign became very thin after  a mile, and zero footprints or any human sign after the backpacking camp 2.  I was very much alone after that, and evident with the thick weedy overgrowth (thought path was visible nearly always).  As campsites 1&2 were in a hollow that was muddy & buggy I kept going to campsite 4, which was on high ground with much of the undergrowth removed, and excellent visibility.  No sign of large mammal life save one whitetail deer buck I scared about 1 mile short of campsite 3.  The site looked like it had not been used for a year.  No footprints, disturbed anything, and the piles of logs were pretty covered in fungus.  I decided to go a bit further on the trail looking for fresh water before doubling back to make camp; I was a running a little low on water to enjoy lots of drinks.  After campsite 4, the trail heads steeply down into a ravine following a creek (the creek head is more or less at camp 4).  Going down 150 yards or so down the trail in the ravine, its gets very dark and overgrown, and I got a sudden creepy feeling I was being watched, and I kept halting to listen as I may have been hearing echoes of my own pack squeaking.  Trust your instincts.  Not finding water, and the creepy feeling getting much worse, I turned around heading back up to make do with the water I brought in.  Half way back up I noticed I had earlier walked right by a very strange structure formed out of 3-6 thick trees bent and broken about 6-12 feet off the ground.  They were all bent inward towards each other from different directions, still with green leaves, and no other trees around showing wind stress or damage, and this being in a protected ravine, it made no sense.  Ive never seen it like that before, except maybe where one tree felled another, but not bent and broken midway up the trunk.  Besides, there was no big fell-tree in sight.  I shot a few quick pictures with my iPhone and quickly headed up to camp.  Seems safer there being open and with a homey firepit, and a four-square around it of linearly-laid logs etc.  After dinner, I went to bed about 9.  The sleep setup is a camping hammock between trees maybe 30-35 from the fire, a bugnet bag surrounding the hammock (dark mesh also affords privacy), and a taught inverted V-shaped tarp over all in case it rains.  I was just getting settled and then endless noises started.  Noises I could not identify for the most part.<BR> <BR>Around 9:30PM, it was nearly pitch black with occasional wind gusts very high at the top of trees.  Below me towards the deep woods ravine: and then two loud knocks in quick succession.  I recall how loud, close, and how musical they were, not dull bark on bark, but like a baseball bat against a oak tree, or like the sound wood makes when it is being split by an axe.  But nobody could swing an axe that fast, or just make two swings, much less there was no one within miles.  The knocks were followed by sticks breaking underfoot, and then a loud snort or two like a big deer or horse maybe 20 from my hammock.  I was frozen to move.  Then someone shook my tarp very quick.  I shone my light and saw nothing (but difficult to get good beam through the bug net).  Maybe  hour later the sound of a rock landing and loudly clacking against other rocks in a dry creek 25 behind me, and something plucked one of the strings on my hammock or tarp (boinnnnng).  Man, something was right there.  Again a quick look to catch something and I could see nothing with my flashlight  but the beam only went about 8 feet at most through the bugnet.  At this point and the rest of the night my heart was pounding, and I was praying for rain to make the things go home.  <BR><BR>A while later, up on the ridge where the single knock came from, a loud ugly animal scream  - maybe six in a row (like a fox makes, but deeper).  At some point I swear someone was messing with a stick on the fire, the coals moved around like someone threw something at them again and again.  I got an impression this was like kids playing around or something.  At the same time, for at least two hours, the constant sound maybe 30-40 feet away of someone walking around quietly and picking through a rotten log or removing bark from a tree.  Like looking for grubs or ?? There arent any woodpeckers a 2 AM  right?  Also, I was surprised that no whiporwhills, chuck-wills-widow or other birds were making noise.  Come to think of it, no owls either.  Very quiet except for these things.  The log chipper was flinging bits and pieces  like small twigs landing on my tarp over and over, but would stop if I shone the flashlight.  The whole thing was like someone messing with me having fun.  I sat motionless. But more of the same went on and on.  I did get the impression someone was more curious and insistent then going to eat me.  By then I had my machete, knife, and flashlight in the hammock with me  but I am a small man.  <BR>I lost track of what came before what between about 1 and 3, but this went on all night until about 4AM.  Around 2, I heard a fluttering sound about the hammock and tarp (like someone blowing several loose raspberries with their lips bbbbfppppt, and flicking the tarp with their fingers).  This was really annoying.  At some point around 3, I fell asleep exhausted, but awoke to the sound of a dogs collar tags coming closer jing-jing-JING-JING getting louder and closer  Thank heavens, a dog to chase them away!  But I yelled Hey!, and it stopped instantly. But I found there was no dog, and instead it was my zipper pulls jingling together  someone had been flicking and jingling them only 2 feet from my head.  Later I swear I heard people talking, a woman in a casual conversational tone, like someone hiking to camp (again felt great relief.  But who would be hiking to camp at 2 AM, and it stopped suddenly and nobody was here  plus no lights of course.  I hear her again, and then nothing.  Could not make out any words (at one point I thought maybe someone in the woods was messing with me), but there was no one there and no footprints or otherwise noises that people make.  Whatever these things were, they were fast and deadly quiet when they wanted to be.  Occasionally sticks breaking underfoot, or grunts, but not much.   Ive heard deer breaking sticks underfoot, and grunting, so it wasnt hugely different from that  but this is 2-3AM, and kept coming back and they would not do it sniffing around a persons hammock.  <BR> <BR>I remember a few other things up on the hill behind me.  At some point lot of loud wood cracking  trees being broken or pushed over.  But I dont recall hearing the thump of them hitting the ground.  Also, in the great distance over the hill outside the park was some kind of a red-neck rodeo with the sound of jeeps and four-wheelers zooming around, and a few distant trains & whistles.  At one point dogs barking very far away back there, - possibly at the red-neck party but they didnt bark long just a few times (not a coon hunt), and I recall that really upset whatever it was below me in the woods.  I dont recall what they did in response, but I made a mental note that they became very agitated at the sound of dogs (possibly just lots of stick breaking).  During a quiet spell, Id had enough and chanced it to out go pee.  I didnt see anything, but did find one sock was missing from my boot.  Thinking a raccoon got it, and thinking about hiking back with one sock was memorial (funny and annoying at same time).  But the next morning my sock was back, thrown more or less where it should have been. It is possible I was so tired that I just missed the sock in the night, but Im not sure.  Again, messing with me.  Later I woke to some scratching on my backpack like someone checking it out (the backpack was right behind my head leaning up against the hammock suspension tree) and then that started plucking at my hammock guy-wire.  With a quick flash of the light it stopped and  nothing.  It was hard to see directly behind me, but no Raccoon either and they always move from people and light.  Either way, in the morning, nothing at all messed with my pack, sweaty clothes still sitting on my pack, or my food bag set 50 feet away  all pristine and untouched.  <BR> <BR>Very late, maybe 4AM, I hear the scream on the hill again, but this time Much deeper voiced.  Maybe a combination bark and scream.  This one really scared me as it sounded like a huge dangerous daddy.  But nothing happened.  Lastly, I heard the most ghostly howling below me.  Quiet at first, but ghostly, with lots of air and echo, like the way a person would tell a campfire ghost story making a ghost howl, starting high and moving the ghostly echo tone gently lower and lower through all the minor notes.  The long ghostly howl ran twice, then it was over.  I almost laughed as it sounded so fake, and ridiculous after such a long crazy night.  Almost like the Matriarch calling everyone home down the hill now that big daddy was back, and time to go to bed.  <BR> <BR>In the morning, the rain finally came between 6-8AM, I ran out to cover my clothes and batten-down the tarp and was grateful for the peace under the tarp.  Packing up and leaving between 8-9, I noticed a few other things of note, but cannot tell if they were associated, unrelated, or my tired head.  <BR>1. The tarp was last to take down.  Shaking all the rain off, I noticed an extremely dark shape in the open woods back above me and facing me.  Black like nothing else.  Set very low, I thought it might be a huge dark gall on the side of a tree trunk 75 yards away.  I moved around a bit and it did not move or change, so I assumed just a gall that got wet.  In hindsight, there was definitely something about that thing that wasnt right and got my attention so raptly.  Maybe about the size of a crouching adult person, but fatter and shorter.  <BR>2. One of the logs next to the fire had been severely gouged out with bits and pieces pulled out.  But after the torrential downpour in the morning, hard to say when that was done.  But not real long ago as they were colored bits.  I might have a photo of it by accident when I took some last shots of the camp, I can look.<BR>3. On the hill above me, it seemed odd that so many large trees (entire trunks), were laid down in linear piles.  Like piles of 6-10 trees on top of another all on the same direction.  Could have been a logging operation, but there was no logical arrangement of the piles to each other, and no road anyway.  That was another spot that was compelling to check out, but I did not feel comfortable going up there to investigate at all.  <BR>4. I looked over the small dry creek bed behind me for heavy deer footprints but I could not find any to explain the huge ruckus all night, and the snorting next to me, and the stone clacking in that area.  But it did rain.  <BR>5. About 2/3 mile from the exit on the way out, just before the spur to camps 1 & 2, I heard a crash a large limb falling down and hit the ground just maybe 15 feet off the trail to my left.  Pretty close.  Of course hiking Im looking mostly towards the ground/trail, not up.  A bit startling, but not totally unexpected if we had a downpour and storm in the morning.  But I heard buzzing nearby, and my feet moved before I knew it (having experienced yellow-jacket nests in the wild before).  50 feet away looking back and I saw that the crashed tree/stick or whatever, had a hornets nest on it and the hornets were making a small black cloud.  Fortunately they hung around the nest area being also confused, I took a picture from a distance and got out of there.  In hindsight, could something have really been trying to send me a message to never come back?  Perhaps Im over-thinking it.<BR> <BR>I was out by 11AM and in a daze for a few days after that Of all the sounds, the deep cry of big-daddy and the creepy ghost howl bothered me the most.  That or the thing shaking and plucking at my tarp guy lines, jingling my sipper pulls over my head,  and tossing rocks and sticks at me.  I could not explain those at all.

    " While at our cabin at Castor River in Bollinger Co Missouri our 14 yr old son and his friend witnessed what they said appeared to be a 7-8 ft tall human like creature knock down a dead tree across the river in their direction. (my wife and I were at the spot the day before and the tree wasn''t there..when we went the next morning we seen it in the river) It then landed in the water and stood there, it started towards them and they ran back to our cabin. Before this happened they heard rocks or something being thrown into the water. This occurred about 10-11 at night while the boys were in the river gigging. Which is knee to waist deep. These boys are all boy and spend nights out in tents at the river and woods.. This night they were extremely upset and scared and wouldn''t stay in the tent.

    " Several times a week I go fishing at the James Reed Memorial Wildlife Area just south of Lee''s Summit, MO. It''s about 900 acres plus 10 lakes to choose from for fishing and a area with walking trails. Each lake has a level, mowed area about 20 feet wide all the way round it. It is wooded and brushy between lakes plus there are also open meadow/fields scattered around. Animal life is deer (lots of them), fox, possums, rabbit, racoon, squirrel, turkey, geese, golden eagles, cranes, vultures and many smaller birds. During the week there aren''t many people there fishing so sometimes I''m the only one. I prefer fishing at the lake that is farthest from the main entrance. I think Google Maps shows it as #9 but it has a name.<BR><BR>The first week of August, 2020, I was there fishing for bass and had worked my way half way around the lake when I came upon a very large pile of scat in the mowed walking area. It was well formed and shaped like human feces.  I estimated its size as 16 X 14 inches and about 5 inches high. My first thought was an obese person had somehow managed to completely empty their guts. There are horse riders allowed in the area but I''ve never once seen their hoofprints around the lake in that area not any horse scat.  The pile did not resemble in any way what a horse does. <BR><BR>The last week of August, 2020, I was the only person there and there were no other cars in the parking lot.  I was near where I''d seen the scat.  When I fish I move slowly and quietly. I was on the southwest side of the lake when I heard what I thought was a hoot owl. It hooted three times with no space between hoots. I''ve never hear an owl do that. I walked and fished for another 100 feet or so and was facing the water when in the trees/brush behind me I heard a deep HumphGrrrr sound. Both sounds were ran together and I could feel it vibrate in my chest. I immediately turned completely around thinking that there was a huge dog nearby and I wanted to make sure it wasn''t sneaking up on me. <BR><BR>The sound lasted about 3 seconds and even after I couldn''t hear it I still felt it vibrate in my chest for a few more seconds. I looked as far back into the trees/brush as I could and saw nothing. I wasn''t scared but I felt that I needed to leave so I left and went home. <BR><BR>I was there fishing on Sept 8 or 9, 2020 (can''t remember which day this happened). Same lake, same time, about 11 AM. I was on the northwest side of the lake casting for bass and I was the only one there. Earlier there was a young man fishing but he left about 10 AM. Except for the occasional bird and locust it was quiet. Suddenly in the brush behind me I heard what I can only describe as a small chimp making sounds like Cheetah the Chimp. I would guess the source of it to be closer than 50 feet. I heard it for perhaps a second or two then it stopped suddenly like someone had flipped a switch. I turned completely around and looked as far back into the trees/brush as I could. I even looked up into the trees on both sides of me and saw nothing. I moved a little faster and quickly worked my way around the lake to the parking lot then went home. That was as weird as the owl and growl I''d heard.<BR><BR>This place is about one half mile outside of a city which is a suburb of Kansas City, MO. I do not have any mental illness, I do not drink, do drugs or smoke. I am a retired University teacher. Do you or anyone else have a possible explanation of what I saw and heard? I am really curious and want to know.  Now when I go fishing there I''m looking into the brush around me and up into the trees as I walk. <BR><BR>",

    " I was letting my dogs out to go to the bathroom before I left for work. It was 3:30A.M. I drive an hour to work and get there by 5 so thats why I was up so early. <BR><BR>All was quite and peaceful. Heard a owl off in a tree line. Then about 5 minutes later I heard off in the distance something I had never heard before. I hear coyotes all the time. Ive heard a bobcat screaming before, but this was far different. It sounded like it was quite always off whatever it was, but sounded very big and deep. <BR><BR>The only way I can think to explain the noise was like a big burley man yelling AWWWWWWWW for about 5-10 seconds long. Then nothing else. It caused a neighbor dog down the road to start barking but didnt seem to phase my dogs. <BR><BR>The direction that the noise came from is about 2-3 miles of a combination of timber and farm land, then becomes a big river bottoms and the grand river. <BR><BR>I dont think whatever made the noise was 2-3 miles away, maybe a mile. I have never heard anything like that before in my life and Ive been a outdoors guy my whole life. Ive watched different Bigfoot shows hear vocalizations on them and thats the closest thing I can think of that this sounded like. However I feel like recorded things on TV doesnt give you the same feel of the power this thing seemed to have, it sent chills down my spine.

    " Two friends and myself were driving back roads in our home town out of boredom in the evening. We stopped at a small conservation area known as Riverside off a dirt road that shares the same name. <BR><BR>There is a boat ramp off the Meremac River and a picnic table about 50 yards off the road and obstructed by woods and brush. There are trash barrels at the location and fishermen empty their coolers and discard fishing waste when they take their boats out of the water. There are farms and residences in the area, but nothing for about half a mile due to the area''s proclivity to flood. There have also been incidents of violence in this location in the past (person on person) so there''s a local aversion to the area, which makes it particularly absent of people at night.<BR><BR>The three of us were talking and walking down the boat ramp to the edge of the river (the trees and brush make the ramp the only place that the river is visible in this area). There is a small gravel bar/island that is heavily wooded about 200 feet from the edge of the boat ramp where the river forks and splits. There was a decent amount of moon light and we were watching the water. We heard some noise in the brush on the island or maybe the opposite bank. A few moments passed and what sounded likes a rock hit the bank on our side (maybe fifteen or twenty feet down river) followed by what sounded like another rock landing in the river (presumably in the same vicinity of the first rock). <BR><BR>We froze for maybe ten seconds, then we heard what we all collectively determined to sound like an ape yowling from about the same direction of the noises and rocks. I would say the sound was more like a one tone, moderately deep exhale or grunt that had a shrill undertone that gave it an aggressive feeling. We left immediately.<BR><BR>We''ve all lived in rural areas for most of our lives and know the sounds of local wildlife.

My friend and I heard him screaming and ran back to camp to see what was wrong. I know my son was young at the time, but I''d never seen him so upset. He kept repeating that he saw a big black man standing part way down the road. Now at the time, we lived in St. Louis and my son was used to seeing black people but he insisted this man was differant. After we calmed him down he told us the man was real tall. Way taller than me or my friend, who was about 6''2''. He also insisted the man wasn''t wearing clothes but was covered with black hair. <BR><BR>My friend and I were both armed and decided to take a look down the road. It was getting dark by then and we didn''t see or hear anything out of the ordinary except it did smell like something dead was close. There was to be a huge meteore shower that night so we walked out into a pasture to have a clear view of the sky. The pasture bordered the woods on our left, with our camp and the river to our front. We hadn''t been sitting there long when we heard something heavy walking around in the woods. At first we thought it might be a stray cow but the more we listened it sounded more like the way a man would move. What really got our attention was that all of a sudden we heard limbs snapping. Not small ones but big enough to sound like rifle shots. I''m a Vietnam Vet and a long time hunter. I''ve never heard anything move through woods like that. It spooked us enough that even though we were armed, both carrying .44 cal hand guns, we didn''t venture into the woods to investigate. That ended our star gazeing and we spent most of the rest of the night sitting in camp with our pistols close at hand. <BR><BR>The next day we found where something had bulldozed it''s way through the heavy bush and left some good sized broken limbs and saplings in its wake, but to be honest we didn''t look too close. Also the smell of something dead was gone. The rest of the camping trip was un eventfull though I did notice one thing. The lady who''s land we were camping on was carrying a 12 gage shotgun every time we saw her. She even had it across her lap when she''d sit on her porch. Never knew her to do that before. She was of old hillbilly stock and not one to scare easy so I asked her about it. She just replied she wanted it close and would say no more. To sum it up, My son''s insisting he saw a very big hairy black man, the way it frightened him,the noise that night and the broken trail of brush and limbs, the smell and the elderly ladies keeping her shotgun  close at hand, I have to wonder. Especially since I read, here on your site, of other bigfoot sightings in the area. ",

    " I was camping by myself on a friend''s private property near the Meramec River in Steelville, MO (Crawford County). I was getting ready to go to bed in my tent when I heard leaves and twigs on the ground crackling in the woods a few yards away, I thought it might be deer.  I got in my tent, which was a tall tent, about 10 feet tall and left my lantern on outside. I was starting to fall asleep, when I heard something big coming out of the woods, I was Paralyzed, I saw the giant shadow on my tent from the lantern, it was about 8 and a half feet tall with broad shoulders, I thought to myself this is not a black bear, I was about 5 feet away from where my food containers were and my cooler.  It opened my food containers and started eating my bread, I heard low growling, there were teeth marks found the next day, it went through my cooler, dumped it over and stole my meat, like pork and beef steaks and then ran into the woods. I heard some vocalizations down near the river.  I could not sleep the rest of the night. The next day I went down to the river on one of the river sand islands and found some big foot prints, I wish that I had a camera with me, but I did not, I kept it to myself all these years for fear of ridicule.<BR>",

    " Im always doing outdoor activities, floating, camping, hiking and recently Ive had some strange encounters.  First, I like to go conservation areas frequently, and at wire road conservation area off of Grisham ford rd. In Crane,  I was there with a friend it was just after sunset when something would throw very large rocks into the Crane creek. thats all it consisted of is splashing into the creek.  It sounds like  bowling ball sized rocks being thrown into the water making not only a splash but a ker-plunk noise.  This really made me and my friend wonder what was making this noise.  We were very open-minded about what could cause this noise and it happened on multiple occasions, all shortly after sunset when no one else was at the conservation area.  We told several people about this and of course everyone would say its probably just ducks, but like I said the objects in the water were very large making a ker-plunk noise like a cannon ball.<BR>\t Just as we finally had given up on the search for the cause of the splashing, months had gone by and me and the same friend went on a float trip. It happened to be the forth of July in 2008.   We planned to float in my canoe on Flat creek from Jenkins bridge all the way to a low water bridge on flat creek road (a very long float).  The float started about mid-day and about half way through the float is was very dark and cloudy so no moon light.  It was just pitch dark on the creek and at a slow deep section of the creek we were just quietly floating along not talking when it seemed like we startled something very large about 20ft. Away. It was just standing in the edge of the creek when we startled it, so it stepped out of the creek. You could hear one leg pull out the water followed by one more, and it displaced a lot of water making waves. It made a couple more steps up on land into a very forested area.  Me and my friend were stunned, just remaining dead silent and starring at the area were the noise originated.  Then, a very large rock was thrown within 5ft. Of the boat, exactly like the occurrences in Crane.  Even though we never saw the creature, It was very clear that it was a large bipedal creature because of the very long strides out of the deep water.  It seems that we startled it, so it walked just out of sight not really frightened though, then it threw a rock to warn us to get away.    <BR>",

    " It was July, 1978.  My family had just moved from Illinois to Cape Fair, Missouri a few weeks before. Our parents went back to Illinois for a funeral and my sisters (ages 16 & 14) and I (12 years old at the time) were there alone.  It was late at night around 11 or midnight when we all were startled by our dogs barking and growling on the porch.  Normally the dogs would go down to the driveway if they heard something.  This time they stayed on the porch looking towards the front yard barking and growling like I have never heard them do before.  What scared us was that the dogs were scared to go down off the porch. We turned all the lights off in the house and looked out the front windows and door to see if we could see headlights or something outside.  There was a flood light at the corner of the driveway that cast a light on the front yard.  The front yard was all uphill with a 5 ft barbed wire fence separating our yard from the pasture.  The front yard had huge black walnut trees spaced about 30-50 feet apart scattered around.  I was looking out the front window and saw a large figure standing partially behind a walnut tree.  I stared at it a few moments to focus in the dim light to see what it was.  I thought it was maybe a drunk camper who was lost.  You could walk down our back yard to the lake, so I thought maybe someone was looking for a way to the lake through our yard.  People would camp and fish very close by, so we thought somebody was lost.  All around our house it was dense forest and there was only one other house on our 1/2 mile road, so we were very isolated. My 16 yers old sister went to calm the dogs down.  The 14 year old and I were stioll looking out front.  Then after a few moments the figure dashed to the next tree about 50 feet away in about 3 or 4 strides.  I kept looking and before I could ask my 14 yr old sister if she saw that- she ran to the back porch to help my 16 yr old sister with the dogs.  By this time the dogs were freaking out.  Then I looked back to the front yard where I saw it go to another tree, then another tree-zigzagging its way up the hill towards the pasture.  Then to my amazement it cleared the barbed wire fence in one stride and was gone into the night.  My sisters were tending to the dogs so they didn''t see all of what I saw.  My 14 year old sister said she saw something by the tree-but she never said anything more than that.  I don''t know if they were trying to keep me from getting scared, but I think she saw it too.  I told my parents about it when they got home.  They just blew it off to a city kid seeing \"something\" in the country night.  While I lived there until 1984, I had heard stories of the \"Ozark Mountain Monster\" but thought it was just folklore. I did have several conversations with oldtimers from the area and heard stories of bigfoot sightings over the years, but never had the courage to \"go public\".  I am 37 now and do still believe to this day I saw a bigfoot.  I still get chills when I think about it and am having chills while I am typing this right now.  Too spooky!   ",

    " Location: Taney County  3 miles north of Forsyth  under-developed area comprising multiple 10-acre lots, heavily forested, served by a dirt/gravel road.<BR><BR>Date: Late summer (July/August) 1998<BR><BR>Time: 8:30-ish pm<BR><BR>My wife and I were living in a small \"park\" trailer (8x30) on our 10-acre lot just north of Forsyth, Missouri. The area is isolated, almost entirely undeveloped, and composed of heavily forested 10-acre lots. Access to the area was at that time a rather narrow dirt/gravel road which was barely able to handle two-way traffic. The area supports a variety of wildlife including possum, raccoons, bobcats, foxes, coyotes, and a large deer population. Black bears, small and scraggly, are relatively rare, but are reportedly making a comeback in the area and appear to be moving from Arkansas to the south.<BR><BR>Both my wife and I had been to work very early in the day, and were quite tired. We were lying in our bedroom at the western end of the trailer with the windows open, reading before turning in for the night. We had small reading lamps turned on; there was still some light outside, but the sun had just dropped below the horizon/trees.<BR><BR>We suddenly heard a long, drawn-out scream that was very reminiscent of a woman in fear or pain. Our two dogs began barking fiercely and jumping against their compound fence behind our trailer. The long cry was repeated, this time with an upward shift in tone toward the end, and I was reminded of the call of a peacock. <BR><BR>I asked my wife what she thought it was, and did it sound like a peacock. She used to work at an amusement park where peacocks roamed freely, and she said that it was most definitely not a peacock call. When the scream sounded a third time both of us immediately came to the conclusion that someone was in trouble, and we headed for the door. I carried a big, multi-cell flashlight and went out the front door (facing south), while my wife stayed by the door, telephone in hand, prepared to dial 9-1-1 should the need arise.<BR><BR>The only clearing that we had done on the entire property was the long driveway back to our trailer site, the actual clearing needed for the trailer itself, and the small amount of additional land clearing that was required for a well house (and access by the well-drillers for their large trucks). I moved westward, perhaps 100 feet, to the far side of the driveway clearing. There are no street lights in the area and with the sun already below the horizon darkness was falling rapidly. I shone the beam of the flashlight across the forested area from which the scream had come, sweeping it slowly left and right.<BR><BR>There was a shuffling noise about 50 feet further west amidst a stand of several large cedars and oak trees. I swung the light to the spot where the sound seemed to originate and a dark shape moved behind the biggest of the trees. At the extreme range of the light beam I was alarmed to see two red/orange reflected eyes looking directly at me. No other details were apparent except for generic dark shadow. The two eyes were at a point well above the expected face height for a normal adult human. They blinked once or twice, then vanished as if the owner either closed them fully or turned away.<BR><BR>It was growing darker by the second and the only clearly visible area was the cleared driveway and the partially cleared walk to the trailer. All else was in deep shadow. The shuffling noise came again, and a vague shadow moved quickly toward the southwest from behind the trees where I had seen the eyes. I attempted to use the flashlight to see the owner of the eyes, but could only see a tall shadow.<BR><BR>It moved at a run, upright, and I initially thought it must be a tall, heavy-set man. I was still thinking that the screams had come from a female and that this must be her attacker. However, there was no one else in the area at the time. The 10-acre lots to the east and west of ours were unoccupied and completely undeveloped. While there is one house to the south, across the access road, it is set back from the road and was dark; the occupants were not home at the time.<BR><BR>There were no further calls, screams, or noises in the forest, and our dogs ceased jumping against the fence, but continued to bark and wine in an agitated manner for another 10-15 minutes. I returned to the house and reported what Id seen to my wife. Without additional information we decided that a call to 9-1-1 was not advisable.<BR><BR>Within a week we were attending a gathering of the Ozark Mountain Indian Heritage Association (OMIHA) and recounted the incident to several of the men in the group. More than one described having experienced similar encounters with such an \"animal,\" and one man in particular mentioned that he had actually attempted to give chase with his hunting dogs. The dogs got fairly close to where he suspected the \"animal\" was hiding but then returned to him, tails tucked and whining, refusing to pursue it further. He, too, noted that the eyes reflected red/orange in a flashlight.<BR><BR>After that I made it a habit to have a fully loaded Marlin 30-30 by the bedside, but the incident was never repeated; we have not seen or heard anything similar since the original incident. The area is now more populated, all the lots having been sold/occupied, and several of the neighbors have free-roaming dogs. The deer and coyote population is either greatly reduced or they have gone elsewhere to avoid the neighbors dogs. We still have possum and raccoons, but they, too, are far less frequent to the area.<BR><BR>Note: The air was still; no wind. I did not detect any unusual scents, although there was obviously enough for our two dogs to detect as they were highly agitated.<BR>",

    "In July of 2010, our dog went missing for two days, this was very odd as our dog was fixed and never roamed, he always stayed home. Well on the 2ed afternoon I heard him yelping in the woods behind the house. So I went looking for my kids dog. I found him layed up in the bed of the spring unable to walk. He was trying to drag himself home using his front legs. Getting him home and then to the vet, we had to put him down. The dog was said to have had been beaten, the vet said his back was broken, both back legs were broken. The vet said the trama was equal to that as getting hit by a car. Yet, there are no roads or trails in the vally where the dog was found.",

    " My husband and I were woke around 12:30 am with some strange sounds coning through the baby moniter. The bed room the kids are in is right next to ours but we didnt hear anything from our room, it was only through the moniter that the sounds could be heard, at first. There was a squeaking that sounded like someone was messing with the window in the kids room. My husband went to the other room to turn the outside lights on, we have lights on every side of the house(installed after an attempted brake in) while I stayed in the kids room to see if I could see what was making the noise. I was standing beside the window peaking through the edge of the blinds when the lights came on. There was another noise, something hitting/ bumping the side of the house, the same side of the window I was standing on. Then there was a big shadow moving away from the house twoard the woods. The woods are only about 10 feet from that side of the house and this shadow moved very fast.<BR>My husband returned and he looked out the window, saw nothing. We waited looking out the window for several minuets but were able to see nothing. My husband left to turn the lights out, when he returned we stayed in the kids room for a few more minuets then as we were getting ready to go back to bed we heard a very loud \"whoop whoop\" then again \"whoop whoop\" I said its an owl, even thouth I''d never heard an owl sound like that before my husband, who is former militatry and has been in combat, said if it was an owl then it had to be at least 8ft tall, then he told me he didn''t know what it was but it there was no way it was an owl.<BR>",

    " in the summer of 2008 i was on a fishing trip to the neosho river. my parents have own''d a cabin there for about 25 years and i enjoy going with them to set limb lines for catfish and rod and reel fishing the shallow rapids. being in my 30''s surrounded by my older parents and their friends (some of which have purchased their own cabins on the same grounds over the years when one comes up for sale) i am often asked to pitch in on the chores a little more than is normal because of everyones older age. grass mowing, weed eating, carrying supplies and water up flights of stares, cabin repair, etc., that i often will grab a couple poles, fill a bucket with bait and supplies, and dissapear up river on foot for an entire day to get away from my honey-do list.  on this day i was walking along the stoney river''s edge, when i saw the track. i commonly find the usual tracks for animals in our area and am familiar with raccoon, opossum, beaver, badger, armadillo, turkey, deer, occassionally a cow and very rarely other people.  and this track was none of the above. it look''d very very similar to the plaster tracks you see portray''d on television shows about this occurance. i wear a size 12 and the length of the track dwarf''d my own. and was very wide. i had seen my first bear track at that river for the first time a couple months earlier that summer. a small track of a sub adult bear i guess, we do not have bears in this area. but 1 is seen every couple years. i live within 30 minutes of arkansas, oklahom, and missouri. this area is known locally as the 4-state area. and their are bears in arkansas and rarely one will wander this far north. we didnt even have armadillos til a decade ago. and now they''re everywhere. wild pigs are now starting to move out of arkansas and into our area. but i have not seen one yet. but i know 1 person that has. anyway, the bear track i had the older people look at a couple months pryor and they concurred that, thats what they were. but because of the distance i was up river from the cabins when i saw the bigfoot track, the distance was too far for the older people to make so i didnt mention it. they are kind of redneck anyway, they probably would have drank a case of beer, grabbed a deer rifle and wanted to go driving around lookin for it as a joke. anyway my story continues, i fish''d all day and headed back down river mid afternoon. that evening after dinner, relaxing from the day of sun, and visiting with family and friends (keeping my thoughts about the track to myself) at approximately 9 pm i gear''d up and went down to the wingwall of the dam right by the cabins and settled in for some night fishing. thats when the flathead really become active. at approximately midnight, as i was sitting there in the dark, i heard a sound starting to cross the shallow summertime river. SPLASH!,..SPLASH!...SPLASH!...SPLASH! i heard this sound approximately 50 times and it was coming across approximately 100 feet from me. the first splash made me curious. fish sometimes slap their tails on top of the water or make a splash while feeding in the shallow rivers edge. i was excited and happy to hear that sound. i love the sounds of the woods at night. by the 4th or 5th splash i realized it was not a fish because they wouldnt splash that many times in a row. by the 10th or so splash i realized something was entering the river andi was curious. deer??  they have to get to the other side just like i do. you gota cross the river somewhere shallow and rapids free. by the 20th splash every hair on my body stood straight up, and my body was crawling out of my skin trying to get away. i was tingleing in the feeling of flight!!  you know the fight or flight reaction. i''m 6foot 5 inches tall and comfortable with nature and in my youth was a bouncer and bartender and a security guard for years and am very comfortable with fighting. i have felt great fear a few times such as in automobile accidents and work hazzards and i am familiar with that emotion and controlling it. i have NEVER felt this sensation before or since. it was pure FLIGHT!.  i had helped for a couple months pryor to this incident help my parents friend, richard, fix up the cabin next door to my parents cabin. and as this weekend was the first time he was officially going to use his new cabin, i decided to sleep that night in his extra bedroom instead of sleeping on the couch inside my parents cabin. when i heard those splashes i stood straight up, left my poles and gear and drink and cigarettes and everything and walked as briskly as i could straight to richards cabin, up the steps, in the door, straight to my room, in the bed and under the covers. and i forced myself to go to sleep immediately to just GET AWAY. at 5a.m. i met my mother at her truck because we both worked at a local cafe,her waitressing, i a dishwasher, and it was a 25 mile trip to pittsburg kansas where we live and work. we left for home before sunup so we could shower before work with plans to return to the cabins in the afternoon after work. we left everyone asleep as we drove for town. on the trip, my mother told me of something that happened to her while she was sitting on the cabins deck late the night before. she told me she was sitting there, stareing down at the glow of the bonfire that i had built earlier in the day, enjoying herself, when all of a sudden a stink filled the air outside. she said jason, it smelled like death! it didnt smell like no god damn''d skunk, or rotten fish guts, it smelled like death!!  she said it stunk so bad it gagged me and i had to go inside to get away from it!!  she then asked me if that night i had come over from richards cabin to her''s lookin for a snack or sumthin?? i said no, why? she said she heard something on the stairs coming up to the cabin, and then shortly later she heard something moving around outside down below, and then she felt the cabin rocking like someone was bashing themselves against thy pylons! she said it rock''d so hard it knock''d the vcr off of the television and the vcr tape rack that hold all of their vcr movies fell over and tapes scattered everywhere. her story freaked me out and i told her about the track i found the day before and we decided that it was a bigfoot and agreed to just keep the story to ourselves.

    " Ex special forces vet. Thus happened in the middle of July 2013. Lenexa, Kansas, Johnson County. Bike/walking path along small park. South of park. I was riding my bike from North to South. Area is very wooded and flows along a river. It was very below normal temperatures that week. Felt more like fall. High low 60s that week. Which was odd and weird. What happened as I''m heading up a large hill. To my immediate right or west. I heard a large wood knock. And I looked to my right and heard thus commotion in the very heavy brush. I had this feeling something very large was in there. And looking right at me. I''ve seen many types of animals in and around the area. From a mountain lion, a family of Bob cats. And hundreds of deer. I''ve rode those trails hundreds of times. As I was riding up the large and long climb I''d say 100 yards from first incident. Smack, another wood knock. Also loud. Now I''m thinking if bigfoot does exist, what a perfect time to come through this area. This river bed runs all the way to the Kansas river. By Bonner springs KS. So, when I heard the second smack, I said no way can someone be down in that bed. The effort required to get through the brush would be almost impossible... when I heard the first thump I said to myself. No way was that a bigfoot. But if it was it was warning another one. It was a tree falling or wind blowing. It was a large thud. And movement in the brush. My gut was telling me I was being watched. Then up the trail another one. Again, it was cool, foggy and little wind. Only reason I''m writing this is what the retired police officer from Wyandotte wrote. Thus bed would feed to the same area. But, about 20 miles south. If I was going to travel and not wanting to be seen. This would be the perfect area to accomplish this journey. And there are several areas to portage across the river. I have always had a high sense of awareness. Attention to detail off the charts. ",

Along the whole side of the edge where we were walking is lined with trees decently thick. Anyway we grabbed our gear and were walking when I heard what sounded like someone walking along with us but up in the tree area (like 50ft from us). So after i heard it I stopped and it stopped. I started and it did again to. So we kept walking but that''s when I decided to start whistling at it and sure enough it whistled back. The whole ten minute walk it walked with us and would whistle back and forth with me.

    " This happened about 25 years ago but I will remember it forever. <BR>I live in southeast Kansas. My husband and I were driving around looking for a fishing spot. We went down a dirt road to a strip pit (from strip mining coal). I was ahead of Michael and I was being very quiet. Michael was behind me and I could hear him walking through the weeds. I came to a small break in the brush with a game trail on it and I followed it . I walked about 20 feet and came out into a small clearing. I was looking straight ahead at the water and from behind and higher up in the air a screeching screaming sound started. It was so loud that I crouched down and covered my ears and I had my eyes closed. The scream would go for a few seconds and then it would pause and suck in some more air and scream again. This went on for several seconds. I finally could tell that the thing was running away and I stood up and opened my eyes.<BR><BR>When I looked up the thing had jumped the creek in front of me about 10 feet and was running through the trees are was knocking the small trees aside as he ran away screaming the whole time. <BR><BR>I know that I scared it when I stepped out into the clearing. I wasn''t looking in that direction so I didn''t see it standing there. It heard Michael behind me but I was being very quiet. When I stepped out into the clearing I scared it. <BR><BR>Michael heard it screaming and started yelling for me.  That''s when I stood up and looked and saw all the trees being knocked around as it ran past them.  It was the loudest animal I have ever heard. I might have saved my own life when I crouched down and covered my ears. The sound was a bit behind me and up in the air about 7 feet. It wasn''t a bear or bird or anything else I could think of.  It was a sasquatch. Many people have seen them here. We have alot of wilderness and strip pits for them to hide and live in. I could have lost my life if it had wanted to hurt me, but I scared it so bad all it did was scream and run away.<BR><BR>",

    "  It was the middle of August & about lunch time. A friend of mine & I was heading south of Union town & decided to go to Ft. Scott for lunch. So we cut across on a gravel road. I was reading a Big Nickle (advertisment paper) and we were talking & going along when my friend suddenly seemed to quit talking in mid sentence. I looked up and saw somehting running upright manlike all hairy, about 5 feet tall but it was going so fast it was to the trees & gone by the time my eyes had focused. My friend (who was driving) says \"did you see that?\". I said was it about 5 feet tall & reddish haired. He said \"it looked at me\". I said what was it, you saw it better than me, I just looked up. He wouldn''t say it but it was a Bigfoot. It ran very quickly across the road. Otherwise I would have always thought it might be a prank but it ran way faster than I could. It was about 1 block ahead of us when it crossed the road. It was on the east side of a creek & we were just coming to a low water bridge. It was very windy that day. As we drove past the place it went into the woods I looked but saw nothing more and I could see 3-400 yards up a grade to a ridge. As it ran across a small group of birds flew up out of the ditch as it ran into the woods.  ",

    " First of all this happened in the summer of 1979 on the 4th of July. This is the first of two possible encounters I have experienced over 22 years. The second occurred on November 10th in 2001. <BR>We had just finished lighting our 4th of July fireworks and were sitting around the patio talking and relaxing. There were probably 8 adults and 6 kids at my former InLaws farm house.<BR>It was around 11pm when a friend of ours jumped up from his chair screaming for everyone to look at the bean field across the highway from the house.<BR>As we all turned to look we noticed something very large walking West to East aproximately 300 yards into the feild. It was a fairly clear and the moon was very bright that night. The animal/creature walked at a very fast pace through the beans to a point behind a hill where we lost sight of it. <BR>I have hunted my entire life and have never seen anything like this before. It walked leaning slightly forward, swinging it''s arms as it moved across the field. At the distance it was from us the only thing we could notice is the size. <BR>I had been target shooting earlier that day and had a fire arm in my truck. My brother InLaw and I decided to go see if we could get a closer look at it. My 4X4 Ford truck was a former security truck so it was equiped with spotlights. <BR>We enter the field and drove to a point where we could see the trail heading to the East which we began to follow in the truck. We came to a barbed wire fence where one could tell something had crossed the fence and headed off into a tree line some 50 to 75 yards from the fence. <BR>WE sat there for maybe five minutes scanning the tree line with the spotlights and noticed nothing. I don''t know if it was fear or common sense but we looked at each other and decided that whatever tore up the ground around the fence was too close for us to be sitting out in the field looking around in the dark. I put the truck into reverse and backed the entire way back out to the highway.<BR>This area is close to an old military base which stored ammo and bombs during WWII. There are numerous under ground storage bunkers a couple miles south of this area.<BR>No one at the gathering ever mentioned or talked about it again. I divorced 3 years later and have had no contact with my InLaws since then. I later heard tha tthey moved away from the old farmhouse to another town.<BR>I will submit the second occurance on a seperate report.<BR> ",

What startled us really wasn''t the size but the stride! The stride was double our stride, the tracks appx were 8 ft apart!!! I believe in big foot and i know all we''ve ever seen was these tracks, but i know what i saw was not made by a human. My family has farmed this land since 1850 and never knew anyone to fake tracks. We keep tabs on who uses the property, mostly only family. We''ve heard strange sounds before, actually last was by me on nov. 15 2008 at 11:30 p.m. while hunting hogs at night.

SHE STATED THAT SHE HEARD SOMETHING JUMP UP ON HER PORCH AND BEGAN TO PULL ON THE SCREEN DOOR, MAKING IT POP. SHE SCREAMED AT IT TO GO AWAY BUT IT CONTINUED TO PULL ON THE DOOR.

MY DAD LEFT AND RAN ACROSS THE STREET TO OUR PASTURE TOWARD HIS SHOP, HE SAW A LARGE THICK MAN-LIKE CREATURE RUN AND LEAP THE CREEK, WHICH WAS A LEAST 10 FEET ACROSS. THE ONLY SOUND HE HEARD WAS A GRUNT WHEN IT LANDED ON THE OTHER SIDE. HE CAME BACK AND GOT HIS TRUCK TO DRIVE TO HIS SHOP BUT HE NEVER SAW IT AGAIN.

    " Five of us were sitting in a boat in the middle of Beaver Lake about 11:00 PM.  It was just before I moved away from the area, so we were getting together at our friend''s lake cabin one last time before I left.  We were all talking and some coyotes started to yip and howl.  After about approximately ten seconds of this, we heard a low gutteral howl.  This howl was much lower and longer than the coyotes.  I said, \"did you hear that?\" and about that time this sound repeated two or three more times in succession.  Two of the guys dismissed these as howls of a Husky breed of dog.  One of these two owned a Husky in the past.  However, this sound was much deeper than the sound I heard his dog or the coyotes make.  It was almost exactly the same as the vocalizations I listened to on your website.  It was not the screeching vocalizations.  All the sounds appeared to be several hundred yards away.  After that, no more sounds were heard.  Neither the coyotes nor the other sound.  I believe these were sounds from a Bigfoot.  I did not tell of my suspitions, for I have only revealed my beliefs to the guy who owned the Husky.  I felt as though the others may not believe me or make fun of the situation.

    "After the screaming incident we were positive this couldn''t be anything else. We tried to rationalize everything away but I truly believe this was a Sasquatch. Ive heard foxes, bobcats, mountain lions, bulls, ECT and nothing has ever sounded close. I''ve heard male lions call and the power in the call is the same but the sound is not. Also, I had a pretty strange emotional reaction. I had that happen a couple other times out there. Once while I was carrying in groceries not long after the night I heard the screaming. I left the rest of the groceries in the car, went inside and locked the doors. I realized that my husband and I and also avoided looking out of any windows at night for quite a while before this incident. Strangely we never realized we were avoiding windows until after we moved. Even though all that time we were having to tell our kids there was nothing to be afraid of and that there was nothing looking in at them. This creeps me out to even think about now. It was almost like some sort of mind control or tranquilizing effect. It''s very out of character for my husband and I to hide from anything. At the time it was like we didn''t realize that we weren''t spending time outside at dusk or dark. We would just think we wanted to go in. Thinking back on it now it seems very odd like we were being manipulated. We didn''t stay out and have bonfires or catch fireflies. No one was really afraid either though. It''s hard to explain the feeling. Writing about it now, my heart is beating hard remembering the sound, but the night after the calling I don''t remember being afraid. More just kind of numb feeling.",

    " We had things happen that we did not realize were possibly Bigfoot related. <BR>1. There was a owl that would hoot every night. Louder than any owl I have ever heard in my life. We used to joke that it must be as big as a man.  It was also slightly off sounding. Also, it called like this all year long. Not seasonally. <BR>2. Our kids became afraid to sleep in their rooms. They said someone was watching them. They never saw anything, but said they just felt weird. So they slept in our room with us. One night around 2 a.m. we were all woken up by a pounding on our house. Pounding so hard on the other side of the house that our bedroom windows were rattling. My husband yelled and it didn''t let up at all. Just a rythmic pounding. Our gun case was in the room closest to the banging. My husband jerked that door open, grabbed his gun and ran outside with a flashlight. There was nothing there. He ran around the house and still didn''t see anything. The next day we walked around the house looking for prints of some sort and there were no visible prints. The grass was very thick and lush at the time. Our nearest neighbors were over a mile away. This was about June 2002.<BR>3. We had a momma goat that gave birth to twins. We found her and one baby dead by a pond about a mile from the house. Not much left of either except the hides. We thought it was coyotes or maybe a mountain lion, but even then it seemed unlikely. More like they were carried there. No drag marks anywhere. <BR>4. Our new neighbors and their children came over for dinner. My husband and our neighbor went to check Gates and cattle in a pickup. The kids were playing outside in the yard and the wife and I were talking in the living room with the door open so we could hear the kids. About 45 min before sunset her 13 year old son came up to the house and told us he was scared. His mom asked why and he said he heard something weird in the woods. He was starting to tear up while he was telling us but his mom said oh stop that, go play. And he did. I yelled at the kids and told them to come closer to the house and stood with the door open listening. I thought I heard something off in the distance, but I thought maybe it was a bull and sounded odd because we lived down in a narrow valley. I stayed in the doorway watching the kids and chatting and heard the sound again and told the kids to come on in, because it was kind of creeping me out. I was feeling on alert but still wasn''t exactly worried. My husband is a prankster and I thought he was trying to scare me.  By now it''s right at sunset and the woods about 100 yards from the house are too dark to see into. I heard the call again and I have never before or again heard a sound like that. By now the kids are freaked out, crying and telling me to come inside, my heart is pounding and I''m thinking- that''s not my husband.... The sound started low and slowly went high, I have no idea how long it went on but the thing that made that sound had to have MASSIVE lungs. It wasn''t a monotone sound. Almost like there were two sets of vocal cords sounding at the same time. A couple of very low sounds, almost like I could feel them in my chest more than I could hear them, and then it yelled again.  It sounded like the call came from the other side of the creek about 150 yards from the house, directly in front. I was more stunned than scared at this point, but my eyes were watering and I did feel strangely sad suddenly, and I had backed all the way up to the door. Right then the guys came back, from the opposite direction of the calls. We told them what we heard and they listened but heard nothing, grabbed some flashlights and ran down to the creek and followed the creek about a quarter mile but didn''t see anything. I didnt hear it again after that but our kids never played outside close to dark after that either. <BR><BR>After that we had some stuff moved around or missing. A couple of dogs disappeared and one night it sounded like rythmic tapping on the water pipes in the house in the middle of the night. My husband even crawled under the house to find out what was going on but saw nothing. The next day we saw the pin was pulled on the latch for the well house (by the creek) and the door was standing open. Just odd things like that. We didn''t spend time outside at dusk or night after the August incident.",

    " This week, my roommate''s parents, who live about 10 miles north of Russleville, went out of town for vacation. They left my roommate to house-sit, so we took the opportunity to play some video games on their giant 3d tv. While taking a smoke break outside, we all began to hear a moaning in the distance that was driving all of the local dogs crazy. Initially the calls were quite frequent, in groups of three or so, with maybe a minute or two of silence between each group of three. As the dogs would calm down, the howl became audible again. We couldn''t identify exactly what we were hearing, like a siren with a growl in the lower register; but we were too far out of town for this to be any kind of emergency vehicle, or boat horn. We couldn''t even decide that this was an animal any of us had heard before. As the night progressed, the howls became less frequent and farther away, though they maintained the repetitive grouping. My friends know me to be the bigfoot enthusiast of our group, but I wasn''t about to try to confirm what we were hearing as a sasquatch call without some point of reference. When I listened to the 1994 Moaning Howl recording  from Ohio, I asked my roommates if it sounded familiar, all agreed; so, I''m posting this today.",

We got our poles in the water and were enjoying being outdoors when some doves started calling back and forth.  Our daughter began imitating the calls and did a fairly good job of it. <BR><BR>As it began to get dark, I attempted to light my old Coleman lantern but couldn''t get it to generate so we packed up and moved over closer to the boat ramp where there was some light from a street lamp.<BR> <BR>Once it was dark, the noise from the frogs and insects was loud enough for us to comment about.  A couple of owls also began hooting back and forth and our daughter began imitating them too. This went on for some time until one of the owls flew right in front of us - close enough to see it in what little light we had.  Almost as soon as the owl was past there was in incredible roar from the direction the owl came from. It was so loud and forceful that I felt it vibrate in my chest.  It lasted about 5 seconds and then it became dead silent.  No frogs, no bugs, nothing except my wife and daughter looking at me and asking, What the hell was that? It took a bit but the frogs and bugs slowly began their chorus again.  <BR><BR>I spent 21 years in the military and never in my travels heard anything like this. What ever made this noise had to be huge and it sounded angry.  I spent time in Central America and have heard Howler monkeys at close range. They are loud but never did one rattle my chest.  <BR><BR>We stayed a few minutes longer and then packed up and went home.  I''ve spent a lot of time outdoors in various parts of the world and have very seldom felt uneasy - this rattled me a bit.

When i looked towards the area which is less than maybe half a mile away you could see the area behind our fishing spot which was just a hill in the wilderness. Thats when i saw a LARGE dark figure walking very fast. My estimations from the size of the creature to from where i was standing, it was probably somewhere around 7-8 feet tall. There is nothing but ranges and wilderness in that area.. there is no reason for anyone to be walking alone that far into wilderness of Fort Sill...my wife and I quickly left after what i witnessed.. to this day i still havent gone back to that fishing location in fear of what could possibly be there.",

    " We started a trip into the Horse thief Springs Trail from Cedar Lake on Saturday afternoon at 1730. We had a late start due to drive from Texas and waking up two teenagers on a Saturday.  We were in a hurry to make the springs before dark, so we pressed pretty hard on the trail...we had 7 miles to cover quickly. We had planned on hiking The Old Military Road Trail several miles to the west, but audibled to this one due to available water sources.  I made camp on the other side of the Ouachita National Recreation Trail where it intersects with the shorter HST...this was about 200 yards past where a small water flow crosses the ONRT.  About 2100, my son''s friend stated, \"What was that?\"  My son looked at me and asked if I heard the noise.  I wasn''t paying attention because I was making our dinner.  Another call immediately came...it was a series (3-4) of high-pitched whoops.  They were very clear and distinct.  My best guess would be within 1/2 mile to our north. At one point my son said, \"It sounds like a monkey!\" This continued for a while and eventually we heard the \"whoops\" start coming from our south.  The ones from the south sounded like they were coming from past Hwy 1 because we could hear an occasional car pass and it sounded much closer.  The calls seemed to go on into the night intermittently.  I finally fell asleep around 0230 in the morning and was up around 0600.  No other vocalizations were noted during the morning or hike out.",

    " In 1977 I went with my church Bethel Baptist on a retreat to Robbers Cave State Park. We had arrived on Friday evening and would be leaving on Sunday afternoon. Well, on Saturday I couldn''t shake the feeling that we, the campers, were being watched. Later that afternoon a storm rolled in and it was going pretty strong by the time lights out came. The girls cabin was located at the far end of the camp ground and was in the shape of a horseshoe. I was sleeping on the top bunk bed on the right arm, if you were standing at the door, in the middle of the three bunk beds for that side. Everyone was really nervous because of the storm so it took a while for us girls to go to sleep.<BR><BR>Well, I couldn''t go to sleep because I''m really sacred of storms so I was just laying in my sleeping bag when I heard the sound of the screen door to the cabin open. I thought I was hearing things until I heard it bang shut. I told myself it was one of the girls or maybe a counselor going to the bathroom, but then I smelled something foul. At that point I became very still, hardly breathing, and I could hear heavy shuffling foot steps walking around the cabin on the others side. Then the shuffling started coming my way and the smell increased. I became like a board. Then next thing I know I can feel something standing above and behind me and I hear this deep breathing and sort of a soft growl coming from above my head, which I couldn''t understand because I was on the top bunk bed. I wanted to scream but I was too scared. I continued to listen and what ever it was walked to the window at the foot of the bunk bed and then returned to the head of the bed, standing behind me.<BR><BR>What happened next froze the blood in my veins. Something large, and furry, touched my face. It traced my face, and along the headgear I was wearing for my braces. The next thing I remember was waking up in the morning, on the floor beside the bunk bed, in my sleeping bag, with my pillow under my head. ! I have no idea how I got there and it really freaked me out. I thought I had had a really bad dream until the girl who had been sleeping in the bunk bed beside me, on the bottom, grabbed me the next morning and told me she had seen it. I asked her what she had seen and she said that it was a big black hairy creature standing behind me and she couldn''t scream because she thought that if she did, it would kill me. She and I made a promise never to tell anyone about what happened, and I haven''t until this day.",

    " Had an awesome experience the weekend of July 26th 2019. While camping with my son and his 2 friends, at Eisenhower State Park, in Texas. We were sitting around the camp fire at night, about 9:15 pm, we all heard two howls south of our camp sight. Very deep howls, each lasting 5 to 7 seconds long each, with a small pause between. About 10 seconds later, another howl north west of camp. Higher pitch and feminine sounding. <BR><BR>There are no Wolves or Coyotes in this area. Didn''t sound like a dog or anything I''ve ever heard before. The boys, all over 18, were really excited and stood up looking around. They were not believers in Bigfoot, but that got them talking about the possibilities.<BR> <BR>About 20 minutes later, while still sitting there, we heard a \"Whoop\" pretty close by. That was the point when they no longer thought i was just a weird Dad who believes in Bigfoot. Through out the night any sound we heard, we all discussed and scrutinized it. Best part of it all. I never spoke of Bigfoot until that point and they were the ones making the connection. <BR><BR>The next morning we hiked all around the woods looking for any signs, but found nothing solid. <BR><BR>It could have been something else, but from my experiences, it was real. Another big bonus for me is now my son is interested in going out with me, to research and hunt for of forest friend. I feel truly blessed that my son and I, were able to experience this together.<BR><BR>And now did doesn''t think I''m as crazy anymore. Win win win.<BR><BR><BR>",

    " I live in Greenville, Tx, north of town, just off hwy 69 North. I have lived here 12 years and have had strange things going on at my house since I moved here. But in the last 2 to 3 yrs, things have really started happening more. I live down a dirt road off of hwy 69. There are a lot of woods around me, also have several neighbors around me too. In late summer of 2017, I was jolted awake in the middle of the night by a loud banging on my house. I knew I wasnt dreaming because I shot straight up; and at that exact moment, my two little dogs flew off my bed barking and carrying on. I stumbled into the kitchen wondering what could be happening and it was 2:38 am. My two big dogs outside were not barking, which I thought was odd. To make a long story short, I called the sheriff''s department. Two deputies came out and found nothing. From that moment on, every 2 or 3 months, I have several incidents for a week or two, then nothing for another month or two or three, then things happen again. This past winter from Nov. 2019 to Feb. 2020, I have had several things happen. On three separate occasions while I have been propped in bed watching TV, I have heard a loud growl outside my bedroom loud enough to hear over the TV. It was loud and guttural. I have had tapping on the back of my house during the night. It is usually always around the same time of night. In Jan 2020, I was once again propped up in bed watching TV and over my TV, I heard something rubbing on the back of my house on the wall where my bathroom is. My bedroom and bathroom run together. My two little dogs jumped off the bed into bathroom at the back wall barking. Ive had rocks thrown at my house.  Im home alone most of the time. But this past Sat. night, April 18, 2020, my husband happened to be home. Between 11:00 and 11:30 pm, my dog started barking and wouldnt stop, so I got up to holler at her to hush. As I got to my bedroom door, my cat was laying in my rocking chair next to my door.  I paused to pet her and about that time, I heard that same loud, guttural growl at my back door. My cat heard it, wheeled around, and looked at the back door. I went and woke my husband up. He looked out the back door and saw nothing. I went to the front door and opened it and called my dog. She would not get close to the fence and was barking, looking towards the back of my house towards my neighbor''s home behind me. All of a sudden, she jumped back, like whatever it was was coming towards her. I ran to my guest room to look out the window facing that direction; and back towards northwest, I saw something huge and dark in color going across my neighbor''s back pasture, moving fast. My neighbor behind me lives alone, and she has had the same things happening at her house.  <BR><BR><BR><BR>Sent from Yahoo Mail for iPhone",

When I looked I saw a figure leaning out of the tree line. It was maybe 100 yards away. After that the crashing noises got louder. Me and Justin got scared and went to find Jason and Greg. When we found them they said that they had herd it to. At light we headed back to our camp. As we were getting our stuff we heard a scream. It sounded like OOORREEEE!

    " On August 27, 2006, my wife Teresa and I were in the Davey Crockett National Forest about 4 or 5 miles south of Hwy 21.  We were looking into some new areas to hunt this upcoming deer season.  <BR><BR>We had left the truck at 7:30 a.m., we were both pleased with the weather conditions, because the sun was obscured by thick clouds and everything was wet from a recent rain shower.  However, it was very humid.  The vegetation was extremely thick, so visibility was not good at all.  <BR><BR>We left the main road and went down a small road that lead off to the left, which seemed the only passable way to go into the woods and thick cover.  All the way in we heard nothing, the woods were extremely still and quiet with no wind at all. The only thing we could hear was small insects. We made almost no sound ourselves, walking mostly on wet pine straw or wet leaf litter.  We walked in about 3/4 to 1 mile when the trail abruptly ended in a small clearing at which point we headed back.  <BR><BR>We were about 200 yards back up the trail when we heard a sound.  It was short but very clear.  The only thing close to it I''ve every heard was on some Bigfoot vocalizations I''d heard on the Internet.  I''ve spent my whole life in the woods throughout numerous states and never heard this before.  It was like a loud, but not excited, first a yelp ending in a peaceful descending howl.  This was done only twice, but one right after the other.  It was off slightly to our left, and at a guess, about 200 yards away. <BR><BR>We are both interested in the Bigfoot theory (which we believe) and had heard of tree knocking.  So I picked up the nearest good size limb and began to strike a small tree.  I struck it about six to eight times.  Immediately, to our right at about the same distance we heard another very clear vocalization.  This time it was one clear moan, like the second half of what I already described.  It was two different animals.  It seemed as though the one was calling the other, and when I tree knocked the second one was saying \"that''s not me, I''m over here''.  The whole event only lasted half a minute or so.  After this the woods were as quite as they had been.<BR>",

    " Back in 1999, I moved to Leona, in Leon County, Texas.  The house was an old victorian with a huge S-shaped porch.  It had not been lived in (before me) for 17 years yet, it had been used temporarily as a hunting lodge.  The house was located on the front 40 acres of a large 600 acre piece of property.  This property was bordered in the front, by Hwy 1119 and in the back, by Boggy Creek (the Texas Boggy Creek.)  There was no other house in sight or within a quarter of a mile.  <BR><BR>I moved there with my two younger children, who were 6 and 8 years old.  They were not accustomed to living in the country.  At night, to the north of us, near where Boggy Creek crossed Hwy 1119, my children and I would hear very loud howls.  They did not sound like a wolf or anything. I am an experienced hunter. The howls sounded more like eery ghosts!  Just after the howling (each time), we''d hear the coyotes start their cackling.  With the howls, my children would say (in the whispering fearful voices), \"what''s that Mom?\"  I told them I didn''t know.  At that time, I never thought of Bigfoot.<BR><BR>In the summer of 2000, my children left to visit with their father.  I was all alone on the 600 acres, with my dog Lucy Catahoula/Husky mix) and my 5 cats.It was very quiet with the children gone.  One night my dog Lucy started going crazy with barking and I suddenly heard coyotes all around my house.  I believe they were after my cats.  I ran out into the yard where I had a large bell attached to a pole.  I began ringing the bell and yelling, \"Get out of here!\"  I kept yelling as they began to run away.  I continuing with the yelling \"Get out of here\" as I ran around my yard.  Just beyond the light of the porch, at the edge of the darkness near my driveway gate lined with shrubs, I yelled once more.  Something just in front of me, in the total darkness, growled deeply and loudly back at me!  I was completely surprised and the first thing I thought was, \"That''s weird, coyotes don''t usually growl back at people!\"  I wondered why this one was so brave and wasn''t running off with the rest of them.  <BR><BR>Not being a bigfoot follower at that time, it never crossed my mind to be scared.  I responded to the growl with, \"Oh yeah?  I''m going to get my truck!\"  I ran into the house, grabbed my keys, and got out into my Ford Ranger.  I backed it up and turned the headlights straight into the shrubs by the driveway.  I saw something that looked gray in color.<BR><BR>It turned, jumped right over my barbed wire fence and started running humped over or on all fours, across the tall grass pasture next to my driveway.  I was totally confused<BR>on what I might be seeing.  The only detail I could see was that the gray hair on it''s back was thin and long, seeing skin underneath, and the hair was somewhat parted down<BR>the middle.<BR><BR>I backed my truck up and headed out of the driveway to follow this thing.  I drove north on Hwy 1119, paralleling it in the field.  It finally veered off to the right and went further out in the field (towards Boggy Creek) where I could no longer see it.  I kept pondering on what the animal could have been.  Coyotes don''t have long hair like that did. Now, I believe it was a sasquatch.<BR>",

    " Late one summer night in 1990 two friends and myself were riding around the backroads between Pilot Point and Aubrey, Texas. B was driving J and myself around in his new Chevy truck. All 3 of us were 17 year old Seniors at Aubrey HS.  We decided to head down old McKinney Bridge road to where the old bridge was out across the creek. We had been down this road and hung out where it dead ends on several occasions. Mostly to scare girls and such. This night we stopped just to relieve ourselves and we were just plain bored. We all stepped out and went to the steel barricade blocked vehicles from driving off in to the creek. I went to the middle front of the truck, J off to the right which was north. Later after discussing the account, this was when B said he \"felt like something was watching him\". B did not feel the need to pass this on to J and myself for reasons still not known. B also locked the doors to the truck when he got back in. After finishing up our task we both noticed B back in the truck and made some jokes about his lack of courage. I did notice that it was a very dark night with no moon so anything outside the truck lights was just black. J and myself started loudly making \"jungle noises\" as the echoed down the creek bottom. It was at that point I suddenly had this overwhelming feeling that something was watching me and it was close. I didn''t want to seem paniced after just getting through making fun of B, but I wanted back in the truck right then and there. I learned later that J had suddenly felt as if something was watching him at the same moment I had felt it. As I walked back around the truck I was looking off to the north where I felt the \"presence\" of whatever was going on. Not looking where i was going I ran right in to J who also was staring toward the north in to the pitch black woods where he felt it coming from. When I hit J he let out a loud yell and jumped in which I also reacted with my own yells and we exchanged multiple four letter words. After a few seconds we started laughing and trying to catch our breath. At this moments we both heard what I describe as a low growl like sound that ended in an \"oommppff\" like sound. We both stopped and I got out \" Did you hear..\" when it let out a loud screeching roar that turned to a low roar. To this J and myself panicked, made for the truck. The truck doors however were still locked by our friend B who was just sitting there looking at us with wide eyed fear on his face as we screamed like little girls trying to get the damn door open. The truck had manual locks so apparently leaning over and letting us in was too much to ask. I of course had no idea they were locked as I tried to rip the door handle off the truck all the while screaming God knows what. I jumped in the back of the truck and made my way to the driver side to get in while J tried in vain to work the passenger side. I pounded on the glass screaming for B to let me in and all I got was a panic crazed look like he had never seen me before in his entire life. J and I at this point jumped in the bed and were beating on the roof for B to go. B was in such a panic he could not keep the clutch pushed in on his truck because his leg was shaking so bad his foot would slip off. We heard the \"thunk, thunk, thunk\" each time his foot came off the pedal. He finally got the truck started and we exited the area at a very high rate of speed.<BR><BR>We told this story to several people who if the didn''t dismiss it right off, played it off as we heard a coyote or a raccoon and we just got scared. One of our football coaches insisted it was a cougar. He told us they make a sound like a woman screaming and that''s what we heard. Between the three of us we never bought the cougar explanation. What we heard sounded like King Kong, not a screaming cat. The sound was so loud you could feel it in your chest. It seemed to be no more than 20 feet from us. Much like I''ve heard a male lion do at the zoo. And the feeling of being watched was what got to me the most. I''ve never had that sort of reaction to anything like that before. All the hair on my neck and arms stood up before I even heard a sound. Not to mention it happened to three of us at the same time and we did not realize that till we talked about it later. We never really had any closure or a chance a closure on that night until several years later I ran across the BFRO site and read report #2394 which was just north of us and the same year. Now we are convinced we crossed paths with a Bigfoot.",

    " So I am an avid hunter and I used to hunt the Corps of Engineers land on the Texas side of the Red River. I was going to get my trail camera and check the pictures for any sign of wild hogs moving along the river and eating at the bait I had set up. When I pulled up to the parking area, I was the only truck there. Its hot in the summer and in those woods there is little breeze. Its about a 20 min walk through the woods to the camera. So I had navigated my way through the brush and had come around the old piece of original bridge supports and turned slightly north west and something yelled at me about 100 yards away, through the woods. <BR><BR>Its hard to describe the noise. It didnt taper off, just a blast. I froze, and I dont know why, but my instinct was to whoop at it. I whooped and it remained frozen too. I knew where it was but I couldnt see it through the trees. I raised my rifle to locate whatever it was through the scope. I systematically started searching, and all of a sudden, it tore off through the woods. I saw a glimpse of it through the scope as it took off. What I saw is difficult to explain but you know how a skiers legs look them they are crouched, it was like that, like a spring compressing the knees to unleash power. <BR><BR>The sun shone through the trees and I could see the legs had reddish brown fur but was shaggier than a deer. Almost like course hog hair but was soft. Everything about this makes me want to say it was a deer. The fur color, the legs bent, I would even entertain a deer having shaggier fur. But the yell is what makes me know it was something else. Its yell was intimidating and demanding. It knew I was there and was letting me know it was there. After it ran off, I was filled with a sense of dread and had to talk myself out of not going back to the truck and leaving the camera.",

    " My son and 2 nephews went feral hog hunting in North Texas recently and we experienced noises from what we believe were 2 entities other than people.  Were were hunting a remote Texas Ranch at night with no light with the exception of a motion activated green light that would shine if an animal walked within 10 yards and 145 degree radius of the light standing 3 feet on a stick in the ground.  We were placed onto our milk carton \"chairs\" behind dead vegetation about 2 feet high and 40 yards from the light placed over a pile of corn placed by the rancher.  We sat down just before dark at 9PM and waited. I wore binoculars and glassed our area before dark to become familiar with the terrain and where the pigs might trail to the corn.  At 200 yards behind us in a brush area, I noted an animal lying down and looking towards us.  It was only a quartering appearance, but I noticed it was eating something.  I could not identify the animal, only movement and a dark hairy head.<BR>At midnight, we began to hear bipedal movement to our right about 40 yards away and a light breeze wafted an incredibly terrible smell towards us.  We hear grunting and branch breaking.  Within 20 minutes tree knocking began.  It was rapid 3-5 almost staccato knocks answered almost immediately approximately 75 yards to our left in 2-3 slower knock responses.  Whistling started and my son became very frightened.  The green light went on without any noted animal, so I aimed my .45-70 rifle at the lit ground and fired one round into the dirt near the light.  We then heard 2 sets of bipedal footsteps running away from us to our left over the ridge towards my nephews. The sound of the running was very heavy footfalls of what sounded like large animals.  We called our guide and requested to be picked up, and he arrived 30 minutes later.  My nephews reported hearing the running, and they saw one pair of glowing eyes 8-9 inches apart about 8 feet off the ground 20 yards from their boxed blind, and it scared them.  They also heard tree knocking and whoops.  They had heard my shot and said it correlated with running towards their blind and subsequent observations they made.  They were also frightened.",

    " I think I may have seen a Sasquatch near the Montgomery Game Ranch in Jack county last night, slightly before midnight.  A few friends and I were dirt road driving through several very wild and remote parts of our county. We stopped to look and listen. I put my generation one night vision monocular on the edge of a clearing. I noticed a large, black, and roundish shape. I thought it might be a cow but when I focused on it, it stood up slowly on two legs, appeared to be very tall, and took three or four really long, liquid, and smooth steps to get behind a nearby mesquite tree. It appeared to be a huge, man like figure. It appeared to me to be moving slowly to avoid detection, i.e. moving slowly and smoothly with no sudden movements. I tried to zoom in but all I could make out was a huge black shape behind the tree. I was not able to record it and I was the only one in the group who saw it. It''s size and the fluidity of its movements are what stuck in my mind the most. It was more coordinated and smoother than even a wild cat. After growing up on a cattle ranch in this part of the country and spending many years as a park ranger, I have seen many wild animals. This was like nothing I have ever seen before. I can''t say for sure I saw a Sasquatch but feel strongly that I might have. ",

    " I was 14-15 years old. My father and I were camping with another father and son along the Brazos River. It was after midnight and my friend and I were running a trotline we had stretched across the river. As we approached the opposite bank from our campsite, we heard what was to this day an almost indescribable sound on the bank. It was a combination of a low frequency howl with varying low pitch grunts and growls. We immediately froze and shined our flashlights at the bank. There was a steep drop off into the river with a patch of evergreen shrubs and driftwood about the size of a single car garage. This vegetation started a few feet from the water and extending two thirds of the way back up the bank. Our flashlights were poor, as were most from this time period, and we could see nothing. We were within 30 feet of the bank and we both knew exactly where the sound originated. Whatever we heard was behind the described vegetation, so it was obscured. A second vocalization occurred within 10-15 seconds of the first.<BR>The first time it sounded off  lasted less than 10 seconds. The second time was considerably longer, louder, and the meaning seemed clear. The first sound was a warning, the second time was threatening. There was no howl the latter time, only grunts and growls directed straight toward us. It was loud enough both times to be felt in your chest, similar to a large bass speaker in a car, but stronger. <BR><BR>We dropped the trotline and fanatically rowed our canoe back across without saying anything. When we reached the bank we ran back to our camp which was approximately 40 yards from where we landed. Both adults were up and out of their tents asking us, What was that? My father was a Marine and State Trooper. He was rattled by what we heard. The straight line distance from the vocalizations to our camp was 150+/- yards. The sound was loud enough to wake both adults. We planned to spend two nights at that site before continuing down river but left the next morning for a campsite 6 miles downstream. The trip was to last five days but we cut it to two nights due to being very unsettled. <BR><BR>My father and I had both spent our lives hunting and fishing. I was comfortable in the woods and an accomplished outdoors man. I was a Boy Scout for years and had camped on that same spot in the past. What we heard was nothing I can explain. I know of no animal that can make those sounds, particularly in the combination we heard and the low frequency pitch we experienced. Whatever made the sound was massive and seemed mammalian.  <BR><BR>The experience haunts me to this day. Im not afraid in the woods, but the experience still follows me. I wish I had seen it just to verify what I believe it was. The interesting thing is, that even at the time, I knew what it was. There was, for me, no other explanation. I feel privileged to have what I know must have been a Bigfoot encounter, even if it left an indelible mark.<BR><BR>Width of the river was roughly 50-70 yards.<BR>Embankment where vocalizations occurred from top to waterline was 15-20 ft. It was a relatively sandy bank that was nearly vertical.<BR>",

    " Reported on behalf of a friend who wishes to remain anonymous.<BR><BR>While fishing from a small boat close to shore on the Texas side of Toledo Bend, D.R. noticed a strong, musky/fecal odor for several minutes before actually seeing anything. The shore sloped gently up from the water, and was covered with short grass. This offered an unobstructed view to the trees which began growing approximately 20 yards up from the bank. These trees were short (approximately 5-10 feet), and spread far apart. D.R. cast his line into the shallower water toward the bank and that is when he noticed what he thought was someone watching them from the treeline. He also noticed that the creature was attempting to hide behind one of the short trees. It was very still, and did not move for several seconds (reckoned to be two to three minutes). At that point, the creature stood up straight (it had been semi-crouched behind the tree), walked into the open and looked directly at the boat, and then turned and walked slowly up the bank and into the heavier trees. The distance was later to be estimated at 60 to 70 yards before the creature disappeared into the forest. D.R. described the creature as being 8 to 9 feet tall, covered with the exception of the face with reddish-brown hair.    A companion in the boat noticed the smell, but never saw the creature.",

    "   My two sons and I decided to go fishing. We went down to the Concho River to a sort of remote area. We were trying some new bait we bought. It was getting dark but the fish were biting good, so we sat there a little longer catching fish.  I didnt have a flashlight, so I told my boys we needed to get going. But we stayed until we could only see shadows of our poles. <BR><BR>We heard a noise off to our left like something was walking toward us through some real heavy woods and brush. As I looked over you could here and see the birds flying out of the trees like they had been scared. It looked like one of those horror movies the way they were acting. The footsteps kept getting closer.  I could tell it was no small animal.  My youngest boy started to cry.  <BR><BR>We jumped up, as the footsteps got closer.  I yelled to scare off whatever it was, but it didnt stop moving toward us. My older boy [15], started saying dad what do we do?  I told them to real in their poles fast. The trail down to the river was about ten feet to our left beside a 6-foot tall fence. On the other side of that was the trees and brush where the noise was coming from. So the only way out was to walk toward the fence then up the trail trough some trees.  The footsteps got right up to the fence line. So I ran toward the fence waving my arms and yelling at the top of my lungs to try to scare it off. It didnt move. The brush and trees are so thick at the fence you couldnt see anything but shadows.  <BR><BR>I told my boys to stay on my right side and get up to the truck. As we made it up the trail, I put my boys inside the truck.  My boy dropped his fishing pole down on the trail, so I went back down to get it.  As went back down I was cursing at what ever it was, to come out that I would beat it to death. Still no movement.  As leaned down to pick up the pole, I looked through the fence to see what it was. I stand 6 feet 1 inch tall; all I could see was a shadow of something that made me look small. I grabbed the pole and backed up the trail to the truck. <BR><BR>As I got to the truck it started running up through the trees toward us. We jumped in the truck and started it.  I spun the truck around to shine my lights at the trees. It took off running back the way it came from.  We got the heck out of there.  I''m not much of a person to get scared but this thing made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. I have never been that scared in my life. Even talking about it makes my hair stand up. I have tried to think that this thing was a bum or some one trying to scare us on purpose, but the way I tried to scare it off you would think that it would have made some sort of noise when it stopped at the fence line. <BR><BR>I went back the next day, crossed the fence to see what if any, evidence I could find. The trees and brush are so thick I couldnt see anything.  I know ill never go back to that spot at night again. I dont know if it was a big foot or not, and Im not saying it was. All I know is it was the biggest thing I''ve ever seen, and like I said, it scared me and my boys worse than Ive ever been scared.<BR>",

    " I dont know if you want a report this old. I just saw a program on TV that made me think of it. <BR><BR>It was either May or June of 2009. I was on assignment as a photographer for Texas Highways Magazine and The Texas State Travel Guide to photograph the Sam Houston National Forest among other East Texas locations on a multiple days trip. <BR><BR>I found a place to park my state car and hiked into the woods, camera in hand, in late afternoon light to try to get some definitive shot of the woods. I was maybe a mile to two miles into the forest and came to a clearing where vegetation had been removed for power lines. I stopped for a while to watch the opposite tree line for a deer or rabbit or such to come out, get my shot and move on. <BR><BR>After a few minutes there was a loud crashing noise on the other side of the clearing that startled me, as deer make almost no noise. Before I could react, a small juvenile black bear came out of the trees, stopped in the clearing edge and put its nose up in the air sniffing. It then abruptly turned around and ran back into the woods. I started to go after it for a photo, but thought better of it as its mother would undoubtedly be nearby. I decided to go back the way I had come to give them space. <BR><BR>I had barely turned when I saw a huge dark shape about ten to twelve feet away through some very thick yaupon brush. Im 63 and I was looking up at a twenty to thirty degree angle to its head and huge shoulders. Texas bears dont get anywhere close to this size, more like an Alaskan Kodiak Bear in size. I froze. All of a sudden its hand moved and a 2-3 diameter tree trunk about fifteen feet long came flying toward me. I ran like a werewolf was after me, and it might have been. I was back at the car in just a few minutes, clothes torn and bleeding from cats claw and briars trying to stop me. I jumped in the car and peeled out, not stopping til I reached Coldspring. <BR><BR>I parked the car and sat there until quite late as I pondered what had happened. It was only then that I concluded I might have just encountered a Sasquatch. I never told anyone but my wife as I might have gotten fired for being unstable. I had to go back two weeks later to a different part of the forest to get my photo I had missed previously. Ive been retired for ten years now, so it doesnt matter what people think.",

    " Hello,<BR>I was talking to my wife, who lived in Mexico City at the time, by cell phone. This happened about a year and a half ago. I drove from my house about 2 miles up the road. I live on farm land so the neighbors are far away from each other. I got to a hill where the road goes left and right. I stopped the car and had the motor turned off. Right before I hung up I heard a yell coming from the woods that were to my right. I told my wife, who is a vetenarian what I heard. She laughed a little and we said good bye. Before I turned the key I heard it again but it was getting really close. Im talking about 200 feet.I did not want to find out what was there so I turned around and came home. I got on the internet that day and found a site that describes different animal sounds. A coyote, a donkey and a bear. The next sound was that of a bigfoot. It matched perfectly. I live about 20 miles south southeast of a town called Seguin. I went back listening the next day and several times after that. I have not heard it again and  I really dont care to. <BR>Mikey",

Well, we were walking along the side of the road where the tree line was by the Guadalupe River. When we started hearing footfalls behind us, very heavy footfalls. The only thing, they were coming from the other side of the road where the sheer rock cliff is, intermingled with a thin tree line.<BR>They were not pranksters like someone already suggested to me. The air that night was weeping (meaning humid). Suddenly we stopped and what ever it was stopped too, but when it stopped it must have stepped on a branch because we heard the branch break. <BR>Well needless to say we ran the hell out of there all the way back to the camp.

    " I have had bigfoot sightings and experiences since 2010 in a rural area between NM and Lubbock, TX with the latest experience occurring last Sunday.  I would like to write my experiences in full detail but time will not let me, so I will only say that last Sunday I was near land that is owned by my father-in-law and we were looking for deer in tree area of a draw.  I noticed a tree close to the road had tumble weeds all around it and up to the top of where limbs begin. I noticed the tumble weeds were a muddy tan color like they had dried mud on them.  I saw that they were that way because there was something dark sitting there facing towards the draw away from the road.  Once looking through binoculars and going back and forth in the vehicle to observe, I noticed that the dark hairy creature kept moving around the tree to make it look like there was nothing there.  Got a little further south of the tree and looking back through binoculars I saw a hairy head with matted fur bobbing up with eyes peering over a branch and then moving its head down or to the side so it was unseen.  This was in the morning around 10:00 am.  It was a beautiful day and not too hot.  The area is marshy with water reeds growing and when we backed the vehicle north and looked saw that the creature had moved to another tree behind the marsh reeds staring toward the vehicle but still secluded for the most part by the reeds and underbrush and the tree.  Saw a deer walk through the side of this area and a wild hog.  I never felt alarmed but would not let husband go and look further because this is a rural area and phones do not always work and not sure what I would do if anything happened to him.  My husband does not think I saw anything but he could not see what I saw through the binoculars.  He saw a blue bird that morning which I did not see even though I looked so we both had different vantage points from where we were sitting in the car.  I would really like to share all of the incidents that happened to me with the creature in 2010 but will need to do that at another writing when I have time.",

    "    On Sept. 4, 2001, I climbed Mt. Massive, southwest of Leadville. The route I took starts at the Mt. Massive trailhead, in the wooded valley where the Colorado Trail crosses Halfmoon Creek. The elevation of this area is just over 10,000 feet. Near the end of this long hike, at about 6:30 PM, I was approaching the trailhead parking lot, maybe several hundred yards ahead, when I heard an animal walking through the trees to my right. The trees in this area are dense, so I couldn''t see anything moving. But I could clearly hear loud footsteps crunching through the underbrush, about 100 to 150 feet away. I was not particularly worried, because the animal was rapidly moving in the opposite direction I was headed. After about 10 or 20 seconds, the animal made a loud, deep, resonant bark, like a combined dog bark and foghorn. The crunching footsteps continued moving away, when after 20 or 30 seconds, the animal made another loud bark, exactly like the first. I didn''t hear anything else. I never saw anything. No one else was in the area.<BR>   <BR>I immediately presumed this animal was a black bear. This explanation seemed satisfactory until a few months ago, when I found out that black bears don''t make any sound similar to the bark I heard. Also, the footsteps sounded as if made by a bipedal animal, but bears don''t walk on two legs.<BR>",

    " My wife and I were about to start a fire for a barbecue at our ranch south of Leadville.  We had just got the fire started when we heard something like a holler or a yell in a very deep tone.  The first vocalization lasted   about 5 seconds.  Then after a moment it hollered again.  We have a large pasture behind the house where we graze our horses.  After the second vocalization the horses were running \"full blast\" towards us.  When they got to us they were very spooked.  Then it hollered again, stopped, and then uttered a few short very gutteral noises. We put out the fire and left, since the sounds seemed to be very close, at the tree line on the end of the pasture.  I would estimate the distance was no more than a quarter mile away.<BR>The noise this thing made is hard to describe or mimic.  It had to be felt as much as heard. It was deep low frequency holler that vibrates in your bones and literally shakes your guts.  You could tell it was a very large animal that was making the noise.  We have had our ranch for a number of years.  This is not the first time we have heard these noises. This was unique, because it was the longest, lasting over a three to four minute period. We have also heard what appeared to be rocks \"clacking\" together, and then \"clacking back from a farther distance as if they are answering each other.  ",

    " Oh my God is all that we can say. It is Thursday 08/23/18 and we are just getting to our vehicle from a harrowing hike. We were hiking the road at Kenosha Pass on the east side that takes you to the twin cones above tree line. We began our hike at noon and hiked up the road. We reached the twin cone tree line area at 3:30pm. It was a beautiful and uneventful hike until we were headed back down the road. My daughter had said she thought that she had heard a tree knock and I was being silly and took a rock and knocked on a large rock off of the road and then tossed the rock about 5 ft off of the road. Literally 2 minutes later we both heard multiple loud tree knocking and rocks were whizzing past our heads. The stench was unbearable-like nothing I have ever smelled before. My 21yr.old daughter began to scream and cry as we were under attack by someone or something. I was so startled that I just stood there frozen as this dark figure was staring back at me. I couldnt move. My daughter grabbed my arm and we took off. I had an air horn that I depressed 3 times as we were running away and that seemed to deter the rock throwing. The rock throwing continued for 5 more minutes as we ran down the hill. We were almost to our vehicle which was parked off the dirt road when we heard a loud guttural whoop off the road abit and we just kept running to the car so very very afraid! We made it back to our vehicle at 6:15pm. I will never return and we are not okay with this. This needs to be investigated please. ",

    " Let me begin this with a brief bit of information about the area.  The South San Juan Wilderness (in the San Juan Mountains of southwestern Colorado) is considered to be Colorados wildest corner.  It was in the backcountry of this wilderness in the fall of either 1977 or 1979 (I forget which) that a sow Grizzly Bear was startled and attacked a bow hunter.  He was mauled but managed to kill the bear with an arrow he repeatedly drove into the bears chest.  It was thought that the Grizzly had long been extirpated from all of Colorado.  If there are Grizzlies still in Colorado, this is where they are thought to be.<BR><BR>I have been hiking, backpacking, camping, and fly-fishing in this area for about six years now, making about 2-3 trips per spring/summer/fall and one of those trips usually includes a backpack into the backcountry.  I am very familiar with the sounds the various animals make in the forests and mountains of the west and of this specific area.    <BR><BR>On this trip I managed to sneak away for a three day weekend in mid-June with the new lab.  I heard that the Salmon-fly hatch had started and wanted to try to get a piece of the action fly-fishing for big, aggressive trout.<BR><BR>I figured I would save myself a few dollars by not camping in the developed Forest Service campsites and enjoy some solitude at the same time.  So I camped in a large series of meadows known as the Trail Creek Primitive Camping area; no water, no services, just camp where you will.  I was about 15 miles from the tiny community of Platoro at the upper end of the Conejos valley and maybe 10-15 miles from the next nearest community of assorted vacation houses known as Rocky Mountain Estates back down the valley.  I did not realize it at the time but this was a remote area even though the dirt road that ran up and down the valley was only about a  mile across the meadows from my camping spot.  Behind me by about 50 yards was the edge of a 150 moderate canyon of the upper section of the Pinnacles run of the Conejos River.  On the other side of the canyon, which is steep but easily crossed by humans, is a huge, expansive mountainside of aspen groves, spruce and fir trees, and mountain meadows.  This is the beginning edge of the South San Juan Wilderness Area. <BR><BR>The second evening I had cooked dinner and taken the lab out for a last evening walk around the meadows.  It had been a good day of fishing and we were both tired.  We went to bed in the tent just at dark.  It was a night of an almost full moon.  We both fell asleep quickly. <BR><BR>A bit later I awoke and thought I head something outside the tent, probably a deer.  But because I was curious I sat awake for a bit and listened.  After about 10 minutes from out of nowhere I heard this unreal, LOUD, clear, resonant, scream/screech/howl/roar type sound from not too far away.  It sounded maybe 300-400 yards away and like it might have been just across the canyon on the mountainside.  It was like no sound I have ever heard in my life.  It was fairly high-pitched and did not have the rough, gravelly sound that cats have when they roar and call.  It was clear, even crisp, loud, and lasted for about 5-6 seconds.  It seemed to be two parts screaming howl and one part roar, as it had that deep quality but was still high-pitched.  I sat there for a minute stunned, and then realized what it must be.  <BR><BR>I have read accounts on this website before about the sounds these creatures supposedly make, and this was what came to mind.  (So I guess chance does favor the prepared mind.)  And it was not that far away.  The sound seemed to be coming directly toward me, like it might have been screaming at or towards me or this meadow area where people sometimes camp.  It felt territorial, aggressive, even a little threatening.  Even though I had a .357 loaded with hot hollow points and a strong flashlight, the prospect of encountering some big, hairy man-thing outside my tent in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere, and alone, was a little more than I wanted to deal with.  I got the dog in the truck and got the hell out of there, with the .357 in my lap.  After a few minutes on the way back down the valley toward an area where I could sleep in peace I sort of had a delayed reaction.  I became unnerved and thought that if I actually see one of these things in the headlights or on the side of the road next to my truck as I passed it I might really lose it.  I was that rattled.  I have lived and backpacked extensively in Montana and in the Canadian Rockies and dealt with the reality of Grizzly bears with no real problem.  But this noise and the creature that most likely made it really freaked me out. <BR><BR>After sleeping in the car in the nearest little town of Antonito (I could not find any lodging at 11:30 at night) I went back a little after daybreak to look around and to get ready for another day of fishing.  I ate a cautious breakfast and kept looking around, worried I might actually see one of these things.  But in the daylight I was not quite as unnerved.  I did not find any tracks in the greater area in which I was camping as it was mostly grass, although I did walk around and search for a bit.<BR><BR>When I got home I went online and listened to recordings of Mountain Lions and Bobcats, although I know these sounds and have actually seen a Mountain Lion up close in the wild.  The sound was definitely not one of these.  But when I went to this website and listened to some of the recordings I realized it had to be one of these creatures.  This sound was a bit higher in pitch than some of the other recordings, but VERY similar in most other respects. <BR><BR>Now I am paranoid and worry that I might not be doing any more backpacking in this beautiful and remote area for fear of running into one of these spooky creatures, especially at night.  <BR>",

I never saw it but we knew it was there. <BR><BR>We were walking very softly through the quakies and I saw an ear flicker.  I drew my bow and the deer stood up.  It was a four point buck.

Immediately whatever was behind us let out a loud, shrill, deep-throated, dragged-out chirp. <BR><BR> I cannot explain it as I never had and never have since heard anything like it.

    " I want to share an experience my family and I had near Lake City, CO on June 12, 2021. <BR><BR>We have visited Lake City for several years in a row, spending a week there each summer. One of our favorite places is Deer Lakes, about 15 miles southeast of Lake City off Hwy 149. We always spend several evenings out there fishing, cooking out, watching wildlife. Also found in that area are two ponds known as the Upper Mill Pond, nearest Hwy 149, and the Lower Mill Pond another mile or two down the road. On our way to Deer Lakes this visit, we stopped at the Upper Mill Pond to fish, but we saw a cow moose and two calves just below the pond eating in the runoff creek. (We almost always see moose near Deer Lakes) <BR><BR>While we were watching the moose from the cab of our truck, we heard the undisputable sound of a wood knock. At first, none of us thought much about it, until we heard another one. <BR><BR>I was in the driver seat, furthest away from the pond and moose. My daughter was in the backseat on the driver''s side while my wife was in the front passenger seat nearest the pond and moose. The girls thought the sound came from the direction of the pond but I thought it came from the other direction. <BR><BR>The pond, and road to Deer Lakes, sits in a valley between two ridges. The tree line on the east, or pond side, is only about a hundred yards away from the road while the tree line to the west, or opposite the pond, varies, in some places a few hundred yards from the road and other places not far off at all. My daughter and I got out of the cab of the truck to listen after we all heard the second knock. Then she and I both believed the sounds were coming from the west tree line. <BR><BR>We waited, listening, and heard another knock, this time seemingly from a different position from the first two knocks. In a bit, another vehicle stopped to watch the moose. When they arrived, we heard another knock. A third vehicle drove past and we heard still another knock as it went by. In all,  we heard what I would guess to be 8-10 knocks, from at least three different positions, but all on the west side of the road.<BR><BR>My family and I talked about it. It was possible that there were a few guys in the woods making the sounds. Maybe one guy knocked on a tree, then another heard it and knocked back. That''s possible.<BR><BR>However, what sealed it as a bigfoot for me happened later that night.<BR><BR>After we heard the knocks by the Upper Mill Pond while watching the moose, we went on to Deer Lakes where we planned to fish, but our lines were too tangled. We did get to cook out though. As the sun went down, we left Deer Lakes but drove further away from the highway, waiting until it got very dark before we went back to town so we could se the stars really well.<BR><BR>Just off Hwy 149 on the road to Deer Lakes is a staging area for people to park trailers to unload their ATVs. There is also a forest department bathroom there. That is where we parked to stargaze.<BR><BR>As soon as we got out of the truck and shut the doors, we heard a knock from the east ridge of mountains. This tree line is several hundred yards from the road. It was not yet pitch dark. We could still make out the silhouette of the mountain against the backdrop of the sky, but it was too dark to make out any individual trees. <BR><BR>I can''t imagine any reason any person would be up on that ridge, at that time of night, in the dark, in the cold, just waiting for the possible chance that someone would stop at that staging area and get out of their vehicle so they could hoax them with a wood knock. I believed, for sure, at that time that bigfoot were in the area.<BR><BR>In full disclosure, I am a bigfoot enthusiast. I watch all the tv shows, I watch videos on youtube, I have been a member of forums. But I live near Amarillo, TX where it is flat, dry farmland. There is no bigfoot hunting around here. I do always keep my eyes open when we visit the mountains or wooded areas, but this is my first experience of anything that I would contribute in any way to bigfoot.<BR><BR>On a related note, a few years ago on an earlier trip to Lake City and Deer Lakes, my family and I were getting ready to leave Deer Lakes. I had to visit the men''s room before we drove back to town, so my wife and daughter were walking up the path from the lakes to the parking lot. They heard what they described as an incredible crash, very loud and sudden. An adult male moose was in the upper lake eating when the crash occurred. This moose was frightened so much that he raced out of the water and into the woods, scaring my family terribly.<BR><BR>When I came out of the restroom they were at the truck and asked me if I heard the crash. I had not heard anything somehow. They told me what happened and I instantly thought of bigfoot pushing over a tree in the woods up from the lake. There was no way for us to know for sure. The girls certainly didn''t want to go into the woods to investigate. So we could possibly have had two bigfoot encounters at or near Deer Lakes. I am almost positive we heard them knocking on June 12, 2021.<BR><BR>Thanks for your time. Sorry for rambling on so long about something probably insignificant to most people. But it was my first encounter and I was pretty excited about it. Let me know if you have any follow up questions.<BR><BR>Tyler Allison",

    " This incident was a scream we heard on the opening day of archery dear and elk season in Western Colorado.  My hunting partner and I had left our camp before dawn to make the final climb into Fall Creek basin from just below the mouth of the basin (approximately 300 yards)  After hunting the basin we exited out the mouth of the basin and instead of returning to our camp we headed north to the next basin over, Thistledown Creek.  From the dark timber near our camp, we were now approximately 500 yards away and a couple hundred feet higher in elevation.  An extemely loud blood curdling scream lasting several seconds boomed out from the direction of our camp.  There clearly was nothing between our position and the dark timber where our camp was located. Yet the scream was unbelievably loud.  It happened just once.  After gaining control of our senses, we concluded it must have been a mountain lion.<BR><BR>I talked to a few hunting guides I know who specialize in hunting mountain lions.  None of them could verify the sound of the scream I described as being from a mountain lion.  I did not consider it to be a Bigfoot until I heard a recording of what was thought to be a Bigfoot on a cable TV special aired this summer in July.  Since then, I have pondered that scream I heard in 1996.  Then my brother told me about this website.  ",

    " My girlfriend and I were hiking the Lake Charles Trail in the Holy Cross Wilderness area.  We had hiked approximately 3 hrs/6 miles when we reached a basin which included 2-3 small lakes.  Upon reaching the basin area (a clearing) after climbing a steep switchback, we immediately heard what sounded like a loud scream coming from approximately 50-75 yards away in a dense pine cluster at the base of a mountain.  The sound grew louder as the animal was moving in a diagonal to us through the pine cluster somewhat towards us.  The vocalization now sounded like a large man wailing or moaning in a loud, rhythmic pattern.  The vocalization would last for 2-3 seconds then pause for 4-5 seconds then start up again.  This went on for 2-3 minutes.  I am an avid hiker and outdoorsman and am familiar with animal vocalizations including bear, elk, coyote, and mountain lion.  I can say that what we heard was not an ordinary animal.  I had with me two dobermans that have a tendency to chase a moving animal however, on this occasion, they were motionless showing a curious stance and looking in the direction of the sound.  As the sound grew louder, I became extremely frightened due to the volume and unknown nature.  I leashed the dogs and reached for my pepper spray as the sound moved towards us.  I cannot emphasize enough the rhythmic nature of this call and sheer volume.    The vocalization eventually stopped and we continued our hike.  5 minutes later, we passed a White River Forest Ranger, \"Lisa\", who we questioned regarding the vocalization.  She had heard it also and stated that in her years of service, she has never heard a sound like that before.  She had no idea what it was. ",

    " Leaving the east gate of Yellowstone near sundown. Somewhere between there and Cody...maybe halfway...and after dark. I saw a dark, bipedal motion moving out of the tunnel of light provided by my van. It was very brief. When I got back to Florida at some point I received a field & stream and read about the skookum cast. After reading it I went to your site and found the \" Wyoming Hotspot\" and it all came back. I''m a cautious observer and realize how your eyes can play tricks. I asked my wife...prior to telling her about the skookum cast article or the information on your site... about whether she remembered me saying anything on the way to Cody when we left Yellowstone during our trip there. She said all she remembered was me joking about seeing Bigfoot. I wanted to be sure it wasn''t a \"manufactured memory\" because sometime had passed. It was a long day...we had seen lots of wildlife and finished with a nursing grizzly with 2 cubs just before leaving the park. What I saw reminded me of a moose in color. I''ve always described moose as being difficult to see at night by saying it''s the black that moves at the outer limits of your lights. Often you don''t get a clear outline of the animal but know by the way it moves. I don''t know if that makes sense but it''s 2:30 am now so I''m a bit groggy. I was planning a trip back this summer to take a better look around. I was finishing a Masters last summer at Colorado State and had a week between classes so we headed to Yellowstone in the hopes of seeing Grizzly....and the Park. Had I been in Washington I probably would have been looking for Gigantipithicus. Many years ago I talked to Dr. Krantz and Peter Byrne while working on a project for an Animal Behavior class at the University of Florida. When I called them they seemed credible and were helpful. My memory is from a second or 2. Two strides that took it from the middle of the eastbound lane, to the middle of the westbound lane, to the gravel on the side of the road...dark...large. Half laughing I told my wife I saw a sasquatch...she said so did she...we both laughed and said we must be tired...she said turn around, which made me laugh even more...We''re just tired. She pointed out we didn''t know when we''d ever get back. I didn''t think anymore about it till I went to your site. I''ll be going back this summer...probably June...depending on the cost of gas...it''s getting crazy again.",

    " Let me start by saying I''m a non believer in Bigfoot, but what my Uncle and I heard and smelled one camping night I can''t explain. My uncle and I spent 12 years exploring the back country of Challis, Salmon, and Stanley, Idaho. Our ultimate goal was to find a way to drive into a chain of mountain lakes called Hat Creek lakes at the base of mount Tayler. We decided to do some exploring past Yellowjacket mine on FR 112 rd. We camped at the end of the rd. at a very small hunters camp at Middle Fork Peak in the Yellowjacket Mts. We set up camp that evening and was just getting ready to fall asleep when the most hair raising howl, scream, grawl I ever heard in the wild. I asked my Uncle if he heard that and his eyes were wide open with a quick \"yes\". Then suddenly the same scream came from the oppisite direction of our camp only a little more distance. <BR><BR>These screams continued as if whatever was making them were talking to one another from one ridge to another staying the same distance away. This went on for several minutes and the whole time my Uncle and I were trying to figure out what was making these erie sounds. We both have spent most of our lives in the wilderness and heard all the wild life sounds, elk bugle, coyotes howl, wolves howl, bears grawl, moose ect. but never heard anything like this before. It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. While we were talking about what it could be, in the tent, after they quit screaming, we decided it was some kind of owl although in the back of my mind an owl could never make this sort of scream. I could just tell whatever was making this scream had huge lungs. We talked for several minutes afterward then started to try to go to sleep when I started smelling a foul odor. My uncle looked at me as if I farted and I told him \"it''s not me\". The smell was awful like decomposing, rotting corpse, maybe a hint of a skunk, and a touch of landfill. During this time the forest was completly silent. <BR><BR>We decided the breeze shifted a bit and we was smelling a dead carcass nearby, deer, elk, bear ect. The smell went away and soon after we fell asleep. The next morning we packed up camp to explore somewhere else. <BR><BR>To this day them screams is etched into my mind and have never heard anything like it to this day. I have kept this to myself until now after finding this site. My Uncle passed away in 2001 at the age of 65, but he said he never heard anything like them screams either.   <BR>",

When I heard whatever it was move closer to my tent, I sat up as quietly so I could put my glasses on and grabbed my .44 magnum revolver.  I wasn''t even thinking about sasquatch at the time.  I was afraid a bear had possibly wandered into camp.  I finally got the courage to turn on my flashlight and everything outside went silent.  I heard no more sounds, and never smelled anything unusual.  Then as suddenly as it started, my intense feeling of anxiety was totally gone.  I did not hear anything running away, but I felt safe and was able to relax enough to go back to sleep.  Nothing else happened that night.",

    " I was playing with my dogs about 200 feet from the campfire right before sunset. I heard a weird sound behind me, pretty far up the mountain. I thought that I just imagined it and kept playing with the dogs. After about 10 minutes I heard it again,  along with a second call farther up the canyon. I thought that I imagined it. Another 5 or 10 minutes went by and I knew the third time that I had heard it. I was a very loud, sharp call very much like what a primate sounds like (from what I have seen on t.v.). I was instantly on edge, as I have camped/hiked in this area many times over about 10-12 years, without any previous incidence of these sounds. I went back to my campfire to start dinner when I heard it again-this time my dogs took notice and were very uneasy as well. After 2-3 more instances, with my 3 dogs cowering at my feet, I decided to respond. Immediately there was a call in reply that sounded agitated,  They proceeded to call back and forth, progressively getting closer to my location, and it was getting dark. I got in the back of my SUV with my dogs to try to relax and think, and then I heard sounds very close in the trees not far from me. The dogs went from terrified to attack mode, barking and jumping at the back & side windows, and I realized the sun roof was open. I panicked, jumped over the seat and started the vehicle and jetted out of there.All of this happened in about an hour or so. ",

    " We went camping in a remote spot off of Highway 21, 18 miles east of Lowman. <BR><BR>Turn left onto Old highway 21 and take a right on a dirt road in front of an old ranger house. The road curves around a couple of miles and we camped in front of a dirt airstrip (warm springs airstrip). <BR><BR>We were only there for a few minutes and began setting up camp when we heard these loud high and low pitch screams coming from the woods. I asked my husband if he heard that. We listened for a moment. I screamed back at them.  I am not sure why I did that. My first thought was that there were people playing down by the river. But then as we listened I noticed the sounds were screams...that seemed to go back in forth from one direction and then something returned from the other direction. It was long with high and low pitches. This happened, off and on, for 30 min. or so. <BR><BR>We soon forgot about about the sounds and began camping out. <BR>The next day, my sons ( ages 13 and 9 ) asked me if they could go up a tall hill and come back down. I could watch them through binoculars and they would talk to me with walkie-talkies. Not sure why I allowed  this.  Anyway, they began their walk and at the bottom of the hill they reported seeing a dead deer. They said it looked like the back leg was missing and saw another bone a few feet from it. There was meat on it and fur but they didn''t notice any guts. They kept walking up the hill. After reaching the top they told me there was a valley on the other side and they wanted to walk just for a minute more. After about 2 minutes they began telling me there was an awful smell that they described as being the grossest smell they had ever smelled. They said it was like something was dead, but worse. They said they were scared and ran over the top of the hill and came back toward me fast. They later told me there were woods off to the left that they entered into. They didn''t see or hear anything. <BR>                     <BR>I am not sure if this is at all related to Bigfoot activities. I decided to write because a few months back I saw a show that had a man  that was recounting his Bigfoot sighting in Ca. outside of some caves and they played a taped recording of what they presume is Bigfoot. I got a lump in my throat. That was what I heard. I played a type recording off of another site for my boys who are now 15 and 11. Without any coaching, I asked them if they had ever heard that noise before. The older one replied, \"Yes, when we went camping at the hot springs. What is it?\"<BR><BR>We will be camping near there in a couple of weeks and I will now be more aware of my surroundings. ",

    " The incident occurred at about 6:10am on the first morning of a Boy Scout Group 50 mile hike in the Payette National Forest.  We had a group of about 10 boys and 6 adults and had hiked into Loon Lake the previous evening.  Loon Lake is a fairly typical Idaho mountain lake surrounded by pine forest, and we had set up camp on the north east end of the lake.  <BR><BR>I was in my tent with my two sons, ages 12 and 13.  We were still in our sleeping bags and the sun was just coming up when we heard the first series of 3-4 calls coming in from a distance.<BR><BR>   It was difficult to place the exact location of the calls because they were filtering through the forest at distance of what I would guess was 1/2 to maybe 3/4 of a mile from our location.  I thought the sound came from a location west and slightly north of us, but my younger son thought it was west and slightly south, closer to the crash site of the B-23, which is on the south side of the lake.  <BR>   The calls were unlike anything I have ever heard common forest animals make.  I''m not a big outdoorsman, but I''ve heard the sounds of most common forest animals and I believe I''m fairly sensitive to the nuances of typical vocalizations.  The calls came in two groups of 3-4 vocalizations each and seemed to float or diffuse through the forest due probably to the density of the trees and the distance of the emanation.  The first group was what I would imitate as  3-4 fairly low \"wwhhhoooooooo\" sounds of maybe 3 seconds each, very lonely sounding, haunting even, but very, very powerful.  The sounds seemed like they came from a very big animal with powerful lungs, judging from the way it emanated through the forrest. Bigger and more powerful than a wolf.  The calls were consistent with each other and the pitch did not vary much, tapering up and then down very slightly at the beginning and end of each call.  <BR>   Also, it seemed like the animal was really cranking on the calls because they would at times start to break slightly into what I would call a raspy scream territory, but only slightly and only in the middle of some of the calls.  My sons and I were talking excitedly about the first group of calls when the second group started, basically identical to the first.<BR>   Other members of the group, both scouts and adults heard the calls as well.  As to be expected, the adults attributed the sounds to wolves and claimed to have seen wolf prints in the area, not willing to concede that it didn''t sound like wolves, and might have been something else.  Upon our return home, I downloaded calls from the internet of elk, wolves and sasquatch (from your website) and had my boys listen to each one and pick the closest to the sounds we heard.  Without identifying the sounds to them, they both agreed the \"Ohio Howl\" from your website was virtually identical to what we heard, although I personally think the Ohio howl is a little higher in pitch.  I didn''t find a moose call to download, but unless a moose can make this type of call, I have no other explanation for the sounds other than sasquatch.<BR>",

    " My 14 year old daughter and her friend were quadding in the woods behind our property which are owned by timber companies. They stopped by the waterfalls to look around and came upon a large footprint on the timber trail. It had rained a couple of days prior to this. There are lots of cedar groves and pine in the area and lots of fresh water from streams and waterfalls. They took some pictures with their phones and with my daughter''s friends foot next to it. They told me about it when they got home and showed me the picture. My daughter took me up there and we saw more prints coming down the hillside to the trail and crossing it into the cedars. The trail is not very wide so this is the only print on flat land. I tried to get a plaster cast but did not have enough plaster and it rained before I was able to get more plaster and the imprint was washed away. ",

    " After the eighth grade, my family moved to Kellogg Idaho and I purchased a motorcycle with money I had earned from a dish washing job.  I spent most of my summer days riding the many forest service roads, logging roads, and trails around Kellogg and the North Fork of the Coeur d''Alene river.<BR><BR>By the end of my junior year of high school, these outings had turned into more organized explorations of ghost towns, abandoned mines, secluded lakes, and mountain peaks.  I used information from friends and forest service maps to identify potentially interesting locations and took increasingly long and difficult rides to reach them.  <BR><BR>In August 1981, I was looking at the forest service maps for the North Fork area and noticed a road leading up to a star and then continuing on to another star about half a mile away where the road ended.  Stars denoted mountain peaks and I was intrigued by the idea that I could ride up to a mountain summit.  It was a longer trip than I usually made, but I figured it could be done in a day.  About 10AM the next day, I fired up my Yamaha 250 and headed out  <BR><BR>I rode along the river and then headed northwest into the back country.  Eventually, I reached the foothills on this warm and dry Idaho summer day.  The road was a well maintained dirt road with compressed gravel on top.  Since the road was in such good condition, I was riding at unsafe-teenager speed until I rounded a corner and almost hit a moose.  Even in  Idaho, moose are rare and this is the first time I had seen one.  It stood in the middle of the road staring at me and wouldn''t move.  I had heard the moose sometime attack people, so I backed up and gave it some room.  It just stood and stared at me, so after a minute or two I tried to go around it.  As I got close to it, it trotted off to the side of the road and continued staring at me as I went by.<BR><BR>From there, I began the long ride upward through the valleys and switchbacks and along ridges ever upward.  The nice gravel road gave way to a back-country dirt road, which eventually turned into more of a trail.  As I rode along the trail, the forest canopy closed overhead and I was riding on something of a game trail through the cool, dark forest.  Even the game trail started fading out as I went up a short steep hill and entered an almost level area near the treeline.  To my right, there was an opening on the trees that revealed an amazing view.  I stopped, turned off my cycle, and walked over to enjoy the view.<BR><BR>I stood for a minute or so looking through the gap in the trees caused by a steep drop-off.  In the clear late-summer sun, I could see the forest and mountains for miles and miles.  As my ears begin to adjust from the roar of the motorcycle to the quiet of the forest, I began to notice the silence.  It wasn''t just quiet, it was silent -- no scurrying animals, no birds, no insects, no nothing.  I turned and took a closer look at my surroundings.<BR><BR>It was the high forest and the trees were between 8 and maybe 40 feet high, with little underbrush.  The ground was bare clay covered by a thin layer of pine needles.  The perspective effects of looking through tree trunks made it difficult to say exactly, but visibility was maybe 100 feet.  It was dark and cool and there was no movement or noise.<BR><BR>I decided to continue on, but when I took a step towards my bike I noticed something unusual in the ground.  It was an enormous animal track and my first thought was that it was a bigfoot print.  It was old and appeared to have been made during the wet months in the spring.  I removed a thin layer of pine needles to get a better look.   The print was very clear and was not distorted or munged.  It was about 14 inches long, 8 inches wide, and 2 to 3 inches deep at the heel.  The heel was narrow, the ball wide, and the toes were more indented than long and straight.  It was facing away from the vista that I had been looking at.<BR><BR>I had seen on \"In Search Of\" that bigfoot tracks were about 18 inches long and looked exactly like big human prints, which wasn''t to be the case with this track.  However there were no claw marks above the toes, which seemed to eliminate a mutant grizzly.  Even though the soil in the area was of the same consistency,  I couldn''t find any additional prints.<BR><BR>As I was mentally visualizing the small bigfoot or mutant grizzly that had made the print, the silence once again intruded on my consciousness.  I looked around, but couldn''t see anything and whatever had made the print was long gone.  So, I decided to finish my ride to the peak.  After another hundred yards or two, I emerged from the treeline and into the bright, late afternoon sun.  The peak was more of a tall hill covered with tall grass and I continued up to the top.<BR><BR>I got off my bike and slowly turned to enjoy the 360 degree view of the  forest and mountains that stretched in all directions for as far as I could see.  As I turned and admired view, I started to get that \"you''re being watched\" vibe and my eyes were suddenly drawn down to the dark treeline.  I immediately saw a shadow in the trees shaped like the head and shoulders of someone looking out from behind a tree, with some brush obscuring it below the chest.  After the initial shock of recognition, I started reasoning that the shadow was a stump, or maybe a suggestive shadow formed by some tree trunks and the crossing of branches in the shadows.  I had spent a lot of time in the forest and I had seen this sort of suggestive shadow before.  After staring at the unmoving shape for a minute or so, I decided that I was \"psyching myself out\" and I forced myself to return to the view of the forest.<BR><BR>But now as I looked at miles of uninterrupted forest, what I saw was the complete lack of buildings, roads, or any sign other of humanity for as far as I could see.  After about thirty seconds of forcing myself to look at the view, I decided to check on the stump again -- just to reassure myself that it was still there.  However as I scanned the treeline below, I couldn''t find what I had seen so quickly seen before.  I looked up and down the treeline until I was sure that I had identified the bush and tree that had partially obscured the shadow, but now there was nothing behind them.  For some reason, my eyes immediately traced the distance from the former location of the shadow to where I had rode out of the treeline.  In retrospect I don''t know why I was afraid of being trapped, since animals in the forest don''t behave this way.<BR><BR>I quickly considered my options -- continue on to the next peek, which had no exit on map, wait and think it through, or immediately blast down the mountain.  I fired up my bike and headed down the ridge line at high speed.  As I reached the treeline, I could only see a few feet into the dark forest.  Even so, I didn''t slow down and entered the treeline at what looked like the most likely location of the former road.  I went through the treeline without incident, but I didn''t really look around to see if anything was there.  This was partly because I needed my concentration on the road in front of me to keep from hitting a tree,  but also in part because I didn''t really *want* to see anything.  I reached the bottom of the mountain in only about 45 minutes.<BR><BR>After that day, I didn''t have much enthusiasm for riding in the mountains.  Somehow, even the trails close to town didn''t really feel safe anymore.  When I left home a year later, I didn''t even take my formerly beloved motorcycle with me.<BR>",

    " I was backpacking with my brother and four nephews at Granddaddy Lake.  We were setting up camp, and my brother and I went off to find a tree to hang our food on.  We were getting closer to a group of boy scouts we had been hearing while setting up camp.  My brother was looking into the trees and I glanced over towards where the scouts were, when I saw something with long white/blond hair was staring into their camp.  It must have been startled by our presence because it took off running extremely fast toward the marsh area.  I remember very vividly the hair bouncing as it took long strides.  The lack of noise that it made along with the speed startled me to the point that I unbuckled my gun holster, concerned for our safety.  My brother didn''t see what I did because he was too concerned with why I was going for my gun.   From the way it was running I could tell it was on two legs, although I couldn''t see below the shoulders due to the vegetation in the area.  I would estimate the height about 6ft.  The odd thing for me is that I didn''t go over to the location to look for prints, although it was standing in a very wet area.  It was bothering me badly to the point that we went over to the scouts camp and asked if anyone in their party had blond or white hair.  None of the scouts had blond or white hair.  Everyone in my party told me I was crazy, but later I found out it was because they were scared and didn''t want to think about it.",

    " This just happened at 2:00 a.m. this morning and I got on this website to submit it as soon as I got home from the mountains.  I need help getting this recording off of my voice activated dictation tape recorder.  Windows Sound Recorder is just not doing the job.  <BR><BR>I submitted a previous report #1027 for an incident in Arizona in September of 2000.  The reason I even mention the previous incident was that the camcorder I was using then did not record the sounds we heard so I purchased a Bionic Ear so I wouldn''t miss an opportunity in the future and in this case it proved itself invaluable.<BR><BR>My 16 year old son and I took a camping trip into the High Uintah mountains of Utah to go camping to escape the triple digit temperatures expected for today in the lower elevations.  Our original intent was to camp at designated campsites either at Trial Lake or Lake Washington but both campsites were full and since it was starting to get dark I decided to just find a spot off a road somewhere and set up camp.  The paved road we were on ended and we stayed on the dirt road until we found a spot adjacent to Trident Lake at about the 9700 foot level that had thick, forest surrounded meadows on both sides of the road with the lower meadow encompassing Trident Lake.  <BR><BR>We set up in the trees next to a flat, three foot high by about eight foot diameter boulder that we used as a table, just off the dirt road.  My GPS unit marks our site at 40 deg 38'' 57\" North by 110 deg 57'' 51\" West but Google Earth put us at 40 deg 38''57.69\" North by 110 deg 57'' 49.25\" West.  We set up camp a little distance from other people who had gotten there before us, some to the north, south and a relatively large encampment at the southern end of the large upper meadow to the west of the road.  The Bionic Ear is a parabolic sound reflector with a sensitive microphone attached to it with outputs to headphones and to a recording device.  My recording device is one of those inexpensive GE Auto Voice Tape Recording machines used in meetings to record what goes on during a meeting.  I had it all hooked up, not really expecting to even use it, but at 2:00 a.m. I was violently jolted awake by a voluminous, echoing, sonar like scream and it continued as I scrambled to turn everything on.  I twisted on the rheostat knob on the Bionic Ear and in my initial fumbling with the recorder I inadvertently hit the Stop/Eject button which opened the tape door and ejected the tape.  Cursing myself, I slammed the tape back in and hit the record button and out of the five screams that I heard (not counting what it took to wake me) I managed to record the final two screams.  <BR><BR>On the tape you can hear the screams with the dog in the adjacent campsite doing some woofs but it was subdued and not barking like I would have expected.  After the second scream, my son tries to make some sounds and you can hear me on the tape telling him to \"shut up\" because I didn''t want anything interfering with this recording.  The sound was emanating from the upper meadow to the west and it was resounding off of the trees and surrounding hillsides which you can make out in the recording.  I didn''t put the earphones on because I didn''t need to, it was so loud, but the earphones started a feedback with the Bionic Ear after the screams had stopped so I had to move the headphones to a position on either side of my neck to stop the feedback.  I stayed awake for a while afterwards and there was no sound, not even from the other campers for about five minutes then I could hear conversations but not the content.  I could hear tree limbs breaking about half an hour after the screams and that is when I turned on the camcorder to find out what time it was and it was reading 2:38 a.m. Saturday, July 15, 2006.  When it was light I went to the other campers with the recording and several of them were not fooled into thinking that it might have been a lone coyote or something but they were initially loathe to come right out and say what they were thinking about it.  One of them said it sounded like a monster and then I said \"You think it might have been Bigfoot?\" to which I got a relieved \"Yes!\"  They were very glad that I had gotten that recording because they were starting to doubt what it was they heard.  The campers at the southern end of the West meadow said the sound came from the northern end of the meadow in the trees and they thought it was a coyote, but when you hear the tape, you know that it was not a coyote.  I lived on a 700 acre ranch for several years and we heard coyotes just about every night and this was no coyote unless it was the size of a buffalo.  The people who thought it was a coyote said their own dogs did not make a peep during the screams even though they usually would and those same dogs barked at me when I came to ask these people about the sounds.  My son also informed me later that he had been hearing the sounds before I woke up to record them but he didn''t want to wake me.",

    " In August of 2004, my family and I were camped at Hoop Lake, in the Uinta Mtns of Utah.  Just south of our camp was the outflow stream of Hoop Lake that cut a very deep gorge, some 100+ feet deep.  Along that gorge runs an ATV trail, that we rode along quite often during our four-day camp.  The ATV trail ends on the shoulder of a mountain, and overlooks about 3,000 acres of meadow and climax forest.<BR><BR>On the morning of the incident, my wife, myself and two of our nephews took an ATV ride along the trail.  We ended our ride at the shoulder, and turned off the vehicles. We had been talking about sasquatch sightings and I had expressed the sentiment that I thought it would be awesome to see a sasquatch.  My nephews asked me if it made sounds, and I said that it''s vocalizations had been recorded.  They asked what it sounded like, and I told them that I would imitate it.<BR><BR>I made as loud a vocalization as I could, trying to recall the tonality, and pitch of the recordings.  When I stopped, the sound echoed off of the walls surrounding the meadow, and down a nearby canyon.  It was quite eery to hear the echoes.  They asked me to do it again, and I did.  The third time I made the call, something answered back from the forest next to the meadow.  The hair stood up on the back of our necks, and we decided that we had heard enough.<BR><BR>As we started to leave, one of my nephews shouted \"What''s that Uncle B.....?\"  I turned and saw a cow moose bolt out of the trees on a full gallop.  As it ran it continued to look back into the trees.  <BR>I am not necessarily convinced that what I heard was a sasquatch, but I have heard many different animals (bears, coyotes, elk, deer, hawks, falcons, eagles, and wolves), and the sound that I heard didn''t match any of those sounds.",

    " When I was a child before bigfoot was known to me, we went on a family camping trip in Butterfield Canyon in the Oquirrh mountains below Kennecott Copper Mine. There were six people there. Two adults and four children. The tent was pitched by the creek next to a trail. Tent was tall enough to give the adults a couple feet of head room. <BR><BR>When we were in the tent getting ready to make our beds (it was thundering with alot of lightning) we smelled the worse smell. It made our eyes water and our noses run, it was that bad. Next we could hear a large animal coming up to the tent. It was screaming and yelling. When it got to the tent it stood over the top of the tent. Our bodies were vibrating from the screams, our noses and eyes were running from the smell. When the lightning would go off we could see the shadow of long hair hanging down from massive arms. This thing towered over the tent as we were all ready to die from the fear. <BR><BR>The adult male that was with us went out of the tent to do something. We had never heard of Bigfoot and he wanted to protect us. When he came back in the tent (after we heard scuffling and growling outside) he sat down with his back on the tent''s zipper. His face was white and his eyes were huge with fear. First bit of daylight he had us packed and out of there. Years later he told my granddaughter that he confronted Bigfoot that night and could never get over it. He would never tell us that was there, what he saw.

    " My family and I took a hike to the falls behind BYU family camp located in Aspen Grove, Ut.  Which is I think in Utah county.  On the way back we missed a turn on the regular trail and were soon on a game trail.  We had traveled about a mile down this trail when it became almost impassable.  I looked down to the right and recognized that we had passed the family camp and could see the end of the State Campground.  We were at the far end of the campground and about 1/2 to 3/4 miles above it.  I decided to take a game trail that was very over grown down the mountian side to trek back to the camp.  It was about 3:00 pm and I was concerned that we would be caught on the mountain at dark.  With me were my wife 50, my son 7, and my daughter 11 at the time.  <BR><BR>After leaving the bench we were on we pushed our way through the brush to the next bench.  As we made it to the clearing my daughter and I stopped cold and she said big foot!  What we saw was a footprint about 15 inches long and 6 to 8 inches wide.  The imprint was at least a 1/4 inch deep in the hard dirt.  My wife and son came up behind us and said the same thing.  I jumped up and down to try and make an imprint (I weigh 220 pounds) and could only make a small impression.  We looked around (a little because my family was frightened and I need to get them home) but we did not find any other evidence.  When we got back to camp I thought I would go back and take a picture of the print.  However, after looking back up the hill I wasn''t sure I would find it again and my wife forbade it.

    " During the month of July of 1986, a friend and I wanted to try our hand at catching some Arctic Grayling in the Weber River drainage of the Uinta Mountains.  The hike along Dry Fork was fairly flat and very pleasant.  But after hiking a mile and a half and crossing the stream (Dry Fork) -- the trail snaked its way up a very steep mountain for over two miles.  I remember the hike quit well, because both of us were loaded down with heavy packs and inflatable rubber rafts.  After several hours of hiking in heavy timber, we finally topped the mountain at 9,995 feet and reached Round Lake.<BR><BR>The lake is located in a grassy meadow and surrounded by heavy pines.  Both of us were very excited to blow up our rafts and start fishing.  I remember we only had a few hours to fish before sunset and that we only caught a few trout on spinners.  Somewhat disappointed with fishing, we gathered up our gear and found a good campsite several hundred feet away from the lake.  After setting up our camp and eating, we walked to the lake and found an area that overlooked several heavy-timbered canyons.  By this time the sun was completely hidden behind a chain of mountains and the temperature was dropping fast.  To our shock, we both heard several howling moans in the heavy timber below us.  I would guess about a half-mile away.  The howling was loud and powerful.  I''m almost certain we heard three to five howls and they sounded nothing like a coyote or wolf.  The sounds seemed surreal and not human in any way--and as far as I''m concerned, they were not made by any animal that I was familiar with.  We just looked at each other--trying to figure out just what in the heck would make such a loud and unforgettable moaning sound.<BR><BR>Spooked, we walked back to camp with our flashlights.  We both slept in one tent, which was a little unusual, because we usually slept in separate tents.  Blame it on me, because I was still a little shook-up.  Sometime after midnight, something large moved through our campsite.  As I remember it, we thought it was perhaps a deer or more likely an elk.  From time to time, I would emerge from the tent flaps spotlighting for glowing eyes.  Whatever it was, it had left me sleepless and bone tired.<BR><BR>The next morning; a group of horseback riders we met on the trail told us that something had spooked their horses during the night and they had mentioned something about a Bigfoot.  Welcome to the wilderness I thought--it seemed the further you were from the trailhead--things became easier to believe.  That day, we caught buckets of Arctic Graylings at Sand Lake, they were small.  We moved on to Fish Lake that evening to camp.  I remember we made a rip-roaring fire and talked about Bigfoot and had a night-visit from a chipmunk that scared us.  I can''t explain it--but the place seemed tainted with a bad vibe--we both felt it.<BR><BR>The next day, the fishing was good--almost too good at Fish Lake.  The area was beautiful with steep rocky ridges, but the atmosphere seemed creepy and wanted us to move on.  We caught dozens of good-sized Graylings, fishing from our handy rubber rafts in this L-shaped lake.  Instead of staying another night at Fish Lake--we hiked to Round Lake and camped the night.  The next morning, we hiked back to the trailhead at Holiday Park...a day earlier than planned.  The really weird thing; we left a place where the fish were biting--just because we had a bad feeling around Fish Lake--very odd.   <BR>    ",

    " My girlfriend and I had been walking midday, 230-330ish, when we decided to walk down an overgrown old logging road. About a half mile down the road a meadow opened up on the left hand side and we decided to start walking through it. I had kind of started getting a bad feeling but attributed it to the fact that we were walking through an area that looked nice for a bear to take a nap, and we had heard bears were nearby. I asked if we could continue walking. Maybe another 75-100 feet walking through the meadow parallel with the road she had asked if she could practice her bigfoot calls, sure I thought, midday, perfect to practice. She had let off 3 quick calls and we waited for maybe a minute before we kept walking. Then she came upon the ants. These ants were having a war, but I was too busy thinking of that bear I might run into and wanted to keep walking. But instead took the opportunity to just look. Just look at my surroundings. I was staring off into the treeline for a minute or two, when through the trees I saw something big and fast move from my left to right without making any noise. In that short amount of time, I am fairly certain that I had seen a hand. But it was mostly the texture of the hair that struck me. Very straggly, knotted, long but not being picked up away from the body as it ran. I tried to keep my eyes on it but it disappeared as quick as I saw it, before I saw another flash of it through the trees only this time looking bigger in width. After that I didn''t see it again. I radioed to our main camp to let them know what I had seen. And we sat down. Just looking into the woods, trying to listen for anything. When a deer walked down the meadow from the direction we had come from, stopped maybe 20-30feet from us before it took off screaming. Some more of our fellow campers arrived and we went a little further into the woods. I did not see anything else the rest of that day.",

Numerous times it would turn on so after a while i started sneaking uphill to see what was triggering it. Being in the forest there I got to see all kinds of animals (elk,deer,fox,coyotes,etc.) without them seeing or smelling me because of the way the hill was I could peer over the crest unnoticed. One night the light went on, I was like cool lets see what animal is there this time. When i got to the top of the hill and peered over there was a giant human like silouette standing about 50 feet from me 20 feet from the house it howled/screamed/growled like nothing i ever heard before i turned and ran as fast as i could. I was terrified! What convinced me it was bigfoot was the size shape and sound later that week on tv an Oregon audio recording of supposed bigfoot was the sound i heard exactly. Im 100% convinced it was bigfoot.The following day i did look for prints but it was june and bone dry during fire season so i found nothing.",

    " ME my husband our two children and dog.  Were camping in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest In Arizona.  Right by Bear Canyon Lake at the end of Forest Road 9018. Saturday Morning I went for a walk with my morning coffee. I crossed a  fence looking for the lake. It was are first time camping at Bear Canyon lake and I knew the lake was close.  100 yards from the fence I saw a large mound of feces that was steaming.  It scared me, I knew what ever made that huge dropping was still very close because of the heat coming off of it.  I ran back to my camp site and thought it must have been a bear. I was thank full that the fence was between what ever it was and me.  Sunday morning about 4:00AM my entire family was awoken by a loud howling, screaming, growl. It yelled several times maybe 10 or 12 It was so scary I lost count I thought it would never end. The howling screams made the coyotes go crazy.  it was so close to are camp sight maybe 150 yards away in a sloping north east area of the forest.  We laid there as quite and still as possible waiting for day light.  Their were two more camping sights not to far from us but by the time we packed up and went to talk to the people at the other sights they had already left.  The only sound I could find on your sight that sounded close to the sound were form California the 1993 Del Norte recording. The sounds we heard  were angry or like it was injured or mad.",

The core of the story involved a large, hairy thing which rips people to bits.Allegedly, there is supposedly a reference in the very early days of the Payson Star, the newspaper there. Several cowhands were interviewed, and even the stories of some Indians were solicited. The story is about an attack on a rancher, by some big hairy critter.I have never contacted the Star to verify any of this.

    " First off, I''d like to say that I happened across your website quite by accident -- a link off of msn.com, matter of fact.  I haven''t given this much thought for years.<BR><BR>I grew up in Arizona, and was always crawling around the woods, backpacking.  I was a Boy Scout, and we spent a lot of time getting into the back-and-beyond, where the average camper (and most day-hikers) simply didn''t go.<BR><BR>One of the big experiences is a 50-Miler Afoot/Afloat trip, where you go 50+ miles both hiking and floating, like a canoe trip with portages.  In Arizona, we didn''t have much canoe water, so we made do.  <BR><BR>We hiked West Clear Creek Canyon, an extremely remote and tougher''n hell area to get into and out of.  The \"trail\" was the bottom of the canyon and/or the creek itself.  To continue downstream, we inflated air mattresses and swam, pushing our backpacks on the matresses.  When we reached ground again, we''d deflate and press on.<BR><BR>Needless to say, this meant that the area was virtually human-free.  We saw several bears at surprisingly close distance, bears that looked right at us as if to say \"what the heck are you?\" before scooting away.  The deer also weren''t too skittish, which was cool.  Neither were the skunks, which wasn''t.<BR><BR>This hike travels from roughly Payson, near where we started, to Camp Verde, near where we got picked up.  We actually ended up at the end of Bull Pen Road, which used to be a fairly popular day camper location.<BR><BR>In any event, suffice to say that the canyon itself didn''t see many visitors.  Now for the time frame.  As best as I can recollect, this would have been in 1977, I would have been 15 at the time.  This has been in the back of my mind for that long -- but to *tell* anybody, you must first join the ranks of the loonie patrol.  That''s how you''ll be viewed, at any rate.<BR><BR>All during the hike, we were paying attention to the critters, signs, spoor, tracks, etc.  Several of us were self-described Grizzly Adams, priding ourselves on our ability to identify animals by the evidence of their passing.<BR><BR>About halfway through the hike, we came to what I recall was a mini-meadow.  It was a small patch of grass on a fairly stable slab of dirt, anchored upsteam and downstream by large rocks.  I thought at the time that this slab of soil, which was right next to the creek itself, should not have been so well-seeded with grass and low shrubs, but I suspect the rocks offered at least some protection from the annual floods.  At least enough to retain the soil, if not the plants thereon.<BR><BR>At the edge of this soil, there was a small strip of mud beach at the water.  About two feet back from the water, and parellel to it, was a large footprint.  And I mean *large*.  And deep.<BR><BR>By way of comparison, my foot was used.  I was about the biggest kid there, having a size 15 foot.  Placing my foot next to the print, my boot would be about 70% the size of the footprint.  We had no ruler or tape measure, but I guesstimated it would have been 18 or 20 inches long.  Big dude.<BR><BR>I weighed about 220 pounds back then, so I got to be the depth tester, too.  I stepped in the mud, between the print and the water.  Even though where I stepped was wetter than where the print was, I left an impression of perhaps 1/8\" deep.  We guesstimated the print itself to be almost 1/2\" deep.  As I said, a big dude.<BR><BR>There was no drying of the edges of the print, nor had the edges begun to curl down or slide back into the print.  The grass crushed inside the print had begun to bend back up, so we guesstimated that the print was older than 8 hours, but less than 24 hours old.<BR><BR>We really wanted to take a cast, but (of course) we had no plaster, and couldn''t think of a suitable substitute.  We didn''t have the time to wait, in any event.<BR><BR>Thankfully, the canyon went through a wide spot at that point, and we couldn''t stop to mess with the track.  We had to make so many miles per day, so we had to press on after stalling there for about 30 minutes or so.  We were *very* very vigilant for the duration of that trip, I can assure you.  We had to have walked right past it, either before we saw the track or afterwards.  Creepy, thinking that something that big might be staring at you from the brush or the canyon wall.<BR><BR>We heard nothing, and saw no other tracks, no hair, no scat, nothing we could attribute to \"the big critter\".  We tried, but even our overactive imaginations could not come up with another bit of evidence.<BR><BR>",

    " I have two incidents I''d like to relate.  They both took place in Arizona, but were in locations miles apart and were separated by years.<BR><BR>I was born and raised in Colorado and have been an outdoorsman my entire life.  I have camped and hiked in just about every state west of the Mississipi no matter the weather or season.  And most of the time, I''ve been by myself.  I''ve always preferred camping and hiking alone.  Most of the time, weather depending, I rarely use a tent when alone.  I''ve been that way since I was 16.  I once lived in a VW Bus for a year travelling throughout Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Washington, British Columbia, Oregon and Northern California, mainly camping in remote areas I found by exploring logging roads, two-tracks or what have you.  I''d explored much of Utah and Northern Arizona mainly by myself.  I know the outdoors and the animals which inhabit it.<BR><BR>I''ve been a BF believer since I was 13 when I first saw a still from the Patterson film in a Readers Digest.  I''ve read numerous books on the subject (John Green, Rene Dahinden, etc.) and during each of my travels through the PNW I''ve always kept alert for any signs or sounds, but I''ve never seriously expected anything.<BR><BR>I was married in 1988 and my (now ex) wife and I moved to Arizona in 1990 because of a work transfer.  We immediately set out to explore Arizona.  In 1991 on a camping trip in the Bradshaw mountains I was awakened about 1:30 in the morning by a sound I did not recognize.  Where we were camped was on a level spot about 40 yards off of a forest road.  I''d backed the truck off of the road and we carried the gear further off the road to a point where the land dropped to a steep slope to the west.  On the other side of the forest road was a ridge that sloped steeply up from the road to the east.  It was in a transition zone between forest and desert.  There was sparce timber and a lot of scrub pinons.<BR><BR>The sound that awakened me was coming from the ridge overlooking our campsite.  It was a high pitched noise repeated over and over again at irregular intervals of perhaps 30 seconds to several minutes.  As I listened, there was a return call coming from the slope below our camp.  Whatever they were, they were calling back and forth to each other.  I laid there for about half an hour listening to the exchange.  The sound from the top of the ridge would move back and forth as if it were pacing in wide swings along the ridgetop.  At times you could hear a large intake of breath.  The sound from below also moved, but I couldn''t get a feel for how it was moving.  <BR><BR>I''d been listening to the sounds for about half and hour when my wife (never much of a camper) startled me by asking me in a very concerned voice what the noise was.  I didn''t know she was awake.  She aparently knew that I was.  I told her I didn''t know, which surprised her.  I suggested that maybe it was some kind of desert night bird or something, but she didn''t accept that and as we listened to the two different calls she grew more and more nervous.  At one point we heard a little trickle of rocks down the slope above us and she had had enough.  We waited until the sound above us had moved away again and made a sprint for the truck.  We spent the rest of the night in the truck.  Just before daybreak we could hear the sounds moving off into the distance (to the north) both above and below us.  After the sun had come up we went back into the tent and slept for a while.  When we woke up I looked at our campsite and I could see that there was a trail that came down the slope across from our site, went across our site, and down the slope we were camped on top of.  I did not go up to the ridgetop as it was very steep and my wife did not want me to go or leave her alone.<BR><BR>When back at work I asked around if anyone had ever heard sounds like that and what it could have been.  No one could explain the noises.  <BR><BR>Several years later I found this site and during the course of exploring the site I found the sound recordings and played them.  The recording titled \"Scream,\" 1998 from Columbiana County, Ohio sounded very familiar to me, but I wasn''t sure.  So I got my (ex by then) wife and went through the WAV files leaving that one til last, and watched her reaction to them.  When she heard that particular recording she visibly paled and her mouth opened.  She said that was exactly what we had heard that night, only there were two of them calling back and forth.<BR><BR>That recording is the most similar thing I''ve heard to what we heard that night.  My ex-wife is adament that was the sound we heard that night.<BR><BR>The other incident occurred a year and a half ago.  I was participating in a group camping trip northeast of Phoenix by the Mogollon Rim.  There were about 20 people there and the first night was a pretty raucous evening.  About 10:30 I got fed up with the noise and partying and I put my backpack on and told the woman I had gone with (she also was trying to sleep) that I was heading out and that I''d be back in the morning.  I walked out of camp and about three quarters of a mile down a trail that dead ends near the rim.  I didn''t think anything about it.  I didn''t use a flashlight as it was a beautiful night and was starlit enough to see my way.  After I''d been walking for a while and the noise of the group had faded out I began to feel uneasy.  For no real reason.  Just began to feel, un-nerved.  I take a pistol with me camping, but I''d left it locked in my truck because there were children there also.<BR><BR>I found a level spot next to the trail and bedded down for the night, which passed uneventfully except for the palpable feeling of uneasyness which I convinced myself was paranoia.  I''ve had the jitters before on solo camping trips and convinced myself that''s all it was.<BR><BR>The following night camp was a bit more subdued.  After dark, as there were fire restrictions in place, everyone pooled their lanterns and we gathered in a large circle talking and chatting.  The weather was extremely calm and the air was absolutely still.  <BR><BR>It was not long after we''d gathered that the odor came into camp.  The closest thing I can equate it to is the stench of a meatpacking plant.  It came out of nowhere and there was no reason for it being there.  We''d been there for a day and a half and had not smelled anything until that night.  At first, for me, it was highly curious.  It would drift into and out of camp with varying degrees of intensity.  The rest of the crowd was unconcerned about it and seemed not to care, making jokes about it and laughing it off.  There was another woman friend there who had been a firefighter for the forest service who was mystified by it also, suggesting that maybe it was a bear or something.  I''ve been relatively close to bears before and I hadn''t smelled anything remotely like that before.<BR><BR>All of a sudden it dawned on me what it could possibly be, having read numerous reports regarding the stench of BF.  And this smell fit the descriptions perfectly.  It was rancid.  And it seemed to move.  I began pacing the perimeter of the camp with a flashlight shining it off into the woods, but never saw or heard anything.<BR><BR>Anyway, I guess the woman I''d gone with noticed that I seemed agitated and asked me what was up and I guess my reaction startled her.  She and I had been camping together for about 3 years after my divorce and she had never before seen me afraid and in fact getting up in the middle of the night to investigate noises had become a routine with us (which at first frightened her terribly but after watching a herd of elk move through a draw near one of our camps in the middle of the night, a couple of head of cattle on another camp, and a small herd of deer with fawns on yet another camping trip, she''s gotten to the point where she likes to see what is out there in the dark).  She told me later that she could not have ever imagined me being afraid in the outdoors.<BR><BR>But that smell totally un-nerved me.  I tried not to show it with the group there, but she and the firefighter lady saw it in me.  At one point they asked me if I was going to hike out again and (they both told me later) that the vehemence of my \"no freaking way\" startled both of them.<BR><BR>The odor stayed around the camp for several hours and then inexplicably disappeared.  By the time we were heading to the tents there wasn''t a trace of it, but I had been completely un-nerved, especially when thinking of the feeling I had experienced on that trail the previous night.  That uneasy feeling is apparently common during BF encounters.<BR><BR>And I still am.  I now find that the thought of heading out by myself scares me to death.  To the point where I haven''t gone out solo since that night.<BR><BR>Which is one of the reasons I''m writing this.  I know the fear I feel is psychological and may be based on nothing.  But I feel that I know what that smell was.  Nothing I know of smells like that.  Nothing that will come around a large group of people anyway.  I desperately wish I''d seen something that night so I would know one way or another.<BR><BR>I''ve debated about submitting these incidents, but I finally decided that writing about them might be cathartic and help me get over this irrational fear I''ve developed.  I know that most of what I have written is inconclusive and is largely subjective, but it was real enough for me to scare me right out of the woods.  A place which used to be my source of oxygen.  And now my curiosity about all this has me wanting to go back and find out what the hell is out there.  Especially after reading about the Arizona sightings.<BR><BR>I apologize for the length of this largely uninformative submittal, but sharing this seems to have made me feel better.  At least for now.  Thank you for your patience.",

    " I was camping at Mt. Graham about 1:00 am when I awoke and heard some rhythmic tapping of some type.  About 30 yards away in a very wooded area. Seconds later I heard steps walking around my tent. No breathing occurred just the sound of something walking. And it never went into the reflection of my tent and my lantern light. My sister, husband, son and their hound dog were in a tent 10 feet away and I could hear their dog whimpering.  I awaken my dad and told him I think its a bear. So we got our shoes, gun and flashlight. My 3 nieces were sleeping in the tent adjacent to my sister''s tent. Then from inside this tent my niece screamed. (Later they told us they all heard steps and heavy breathing, and heard sounds from two individuals she said sounded like they where communicating and could hear them run away.) When we heard my niece yell in fear we got out of the tent fast with our flashlight aiming in their direction. But it was gone. It had to move extremely fast or just be hiding and did not make a sound because we were out of the tent in 2 seconds of the scream. We were already getting up to check some noise and do the late night restroom when at 4:00 am we could hear rocks and chattering within 1 second about 50 yards in the dense wooded area. ",

    " My Wife and I went up to the Mogollon Rim north of Woods Canyon Lake to camp for two days. We took our two small dogs with us. I thought if we went during the week there wouldn''t be many people there and I was right. We set up camp in the rain at about 2pm. It rained till about 6pm we saw no one just these big trucks going back in forth on the road till about 5pm. It was very dark and we were trying to start a fire but everything was wet and all we had was a dull ax to chop wood. I believe we were being very noise hacking at the dead wood we were trying to cut to size for our fire. After we got the fire going we cook our dinner and ate. It was very quiet no sound at all then we saw a large full moon rising from the east it lit up the sky. We decided to go to bed around 10pm I put some more wood on the camp fire hoping it would burn all night. As we were in our tent the moon was like a big night light then we fell asleep. At about 3:10am I woke up to a sound that was unlike anything I have ever heard both our dogs sat up and were very still. It was like as if someone was screaming thru a loud PA system it was very clear. I woke my wife so she could hear the sound but it had stop then again it started we were both laying there trying to figure out what could be large in size that would make a sound so loud and long it was echoing in the canyon to the north of us. Then it stop it must of lasted about 5 to 10 min at the most. We stayed in our tent for about a 1/2hr but we both needed to GO if you know what I mean. So we put our shoes on I grab my wife''s 9mm and we stepped out of our tent we could see all around us because of the full moon light. After taking care of business we went back into our tent and went to bed. I wont lie it was hard to me to fall asleep. The next morning after breakfast I took one of our dogs out for a walk in the direction the screams came from and saw nothing but about 200yard in the same direction I found what looked to be a possible shelter made from dead trees about 12 to 15 feet long and 4 to 5\" in diameter. they were set up standing like a teepee there was one tree laying on the ground next to the structure I tried to lift it and found it was so heavy that I don''t think two large men could pick it up much less stand it up like the rest. One other thing I saw was the trees were saw cut but there were no tree stumps around so the trees had to be carried there from else where. If someone did this for fun they had to work hard to do this and I cant see why. The first night we were there no one was camping any where near us but the second day we were there some campers set up about 1/2 mile to the north on the other side of the canyon. That night our dogs were on edge looking out away from camp and growling my wife said she could hear something large moving around in the woods to the west of us but when shining a spot light in that direction she didn''t see anything. I put some more wood on our fire then we went to bed. The next morning we got up and made breakfast took our time cleaning up our camp site then packed and left for home.   ",

    " My daughter was visiting from out of state although she grew up here in Flagstaff.  We decided one day to spend time with one of our hobbies which is photographing panoramic landscapes in Northern Arizona.  We spent the morning in Sedona photographing the red rock country but as usual this time of year the monsoon thuderstorms came up around noon and we went back to the house to relax a bit. We did have significant storms in the area that day but late in the afternoon things began to clear up and we decided to head to one of our favorite spots for sunset photography.  This was at the Arizona Snowbowl lower parking lot.  The area from the parking lot to the west starts with a large lush green meadow before falling away into forest, meadows, and rolling hills (cinder cones)that stretch from Hart Prarie some 80 miles to the Grand Canyon.  We set up our cameras anticipating a beautiful sunset and great opportunities to take pictures.  there were a number of people in the parking lot area (10-15). A minute later two hikers started from the parking lot down through the meadow and I remember hoping that they wouldn''t be standing in that meadow when I wanted to take a photo. As they traversed the meadow and passed out of sight we heard a single coyote sound off in their general vicinity. As the sun sank towards the horizon and we were getting ready to start taking pictures the two hikers came back from out of the woods and up through the meadow nearly to the parking lot. At that moment we heard a scream from the forest several hundred yards below us.  There were people in the parking lot and two motorcycles idling right next to us.  The scream was so loud that not only did we hear it well but one guy on a motorcylce looked at his companion (with motorcycles running and helmets on) and said \"did you hear that-what the hell was that ?\" We know that most people in that parking lot heard this scream. As the sun was now setting in a glorious fashion with thunderstorms around and off into the distance we got busy taking pictures.  As the sun set and twilight began to overtake things most of the parking lot had emptied out except a pickup load of people had just showed up and they were half drunk and wandering around making noise.  It was getting close to dark and once again we heard this scream from the same general area of the forest below us.  The people from the truck said - \" what the heck was that - a mountain lion ?\" and began to laugh and talk nervously - I just wanted to say to them \"please shut up\" since if any other noises were made they would have been difficult to hear above their drunken mumbling and laughing. Finally they left - it was now dark, we hung around for a bit but not long and heard nothing more.  This was not a mountain lion scream or anything else we could even begin to identify.  It sounded somewhat like a scream a human could make but the distance it was travelling was significant.  It started kind of low and built up.  To us it sounded like the voices of 15 people all starting at the same split second and roaring the exact same note.  It had a quality that one human could just not make, both by the volume and the effect of sounding like a group but clearly being one single scream or roar.  ",

    " On a cloudy, cool day I went for a hike at Hart Prairie on the San Francisco Peaks outside of Flagstaff, AZ.  It was August, but the monsoon season was in full effect and it was a cool day for Arizona.  I hiked up slope from FR 151 towards the Snowbowl Ski Resort.  The area has springs and so the plant diversity is high and the wildflowers were at their peak.  Being a cloudy, cool day I kept an eye out for wildlife which would normaly bed down at midday in August, though I did not see anything other than various songbirds and raptors.  <BR><BR>I had been in the area maybe two hours but as I like to wander around slowly (I see more that way) rather than \"hike\" from point A to point B at a quick pace, I had not covered much ground in that time.  I was at the edge of an aspen grove when I heard a loud howling from up slope and a little to the east of me in the direction of the ski resort.  My first thought was that it was a foreign tourist goofing off.<BR><BR>Because Snowbowl has a paved road to it and the views are awesome, tourists from all over the world on their way to the Grand Canyon stop at Snowbowl and many hike around as it is a beautiful and inviting area.  So I thought I was hearing a human.  But I wasn''t so sure after the next howl- I was really puzzled.  The sound seemed somewhat human-like and the volume, though  quite loud, wasn''t too extraordinary- I could possibly howl that loud, though it would be hard to do without real strain and the sounds I heard were almost casual- no hint of any strain.  But it seemed to be an unusually weird sound for a human to make.  Almost as if the human had a deformation of some kind which distorted the sound.  This was why I thought of a \"foreign\" tourist first, because of the weirdness of the sound. I heard about a half dozen calls and it was clear that whatever was making the sounds was coming in my general direction at a rapid pace.  By this time, I was sure it was not a human but a large animal.<BR><BR>I was at the edge of a clearing and I waited at that spot expecting to see whatever was making the calls.  The first howl was maybe 250 meters away and the final one maybe 75-100 meters away.  Then it stopped and I never did see anything.  I did not hear it moving through the woods and did not notice any smells.  It is possible that whatever it was smelled me as the air was gently moving up slope towards the animal.  I think it probable that this was the reason whatever it was stopped moving towards me and vocalizing.<BR><BR>I waited a minute or so after the final vocalization and then I went up slope in the general direction I had last heard it but did not see anything or any indication of a human or animal.  My curiosity was at a peak and so I made a real effort to find whatever it was and spent another hour circling the area looking for signs of a large animal passing through.  <BR><BR>I have listened to the recordings on this site and I did not make a match between the sounds- though there were some similarities between what I heard and the calls from Washington State and the ''Ohio Howls''.  What I heard was not nearly as drawn out and evenly toned as the Ohio recording, but was similar.  A deep to mid-range ''howl'' with a little variation in the tone somewhat similar to the Snohomish recording.  Each call lasted maybe 3-4 seconds and was seperated by various lengths of time from maybe 5 seconds to maybe 15 seconds.  Some of the recordings on this site, if I heard in the field, I might describe as having a ''monkey'' quality to them- distinctly animal-like.  The Ohio recording does not really have that quality and neither did the sounds that I heard.  At the time I only thought of a human at first and then I was merely puzzled and could not classify what I had heard.<BR><BR>I have thought about this incident since it occurred trying to put some explanation to it.  I do not think it was a human for a couple of reasons:  The sound, though it had a somewhat human-like quality, was not at all the type of sound a human would (or perhaps, could) make to communicate to another- say two or more people in the woods who are separated and walking along and vocally maintaining contact with one another. The volume of the sound would have required real effort for a human to achieve and I couldn''t imagine a human being able to howl like that and walk around a mountain at that elevation at the same time- and it was traveling fast.  Nor did it have any element of humor about it if it was just some high spirited tourist having fun.  And there was only one caller, not two or more people hootin and hollering to each other.  The call was somewhat somber in tone and there was no hint of excitement or emotion about it.  Also, a human walking through those woods would have made a great deal of noise and I would have heard or seen a human when I went looking after the last vocalization.  I did not see any humans during that day though I went right to the base of the ski resort and could see the parking lot.<BR><BR>At the time, the sounds did not spook me and I never got that unexplained adrenaline rush and surge of fear that I have gotten on more than one occasion in the wilderness or ocean.  I am quite familiar with the wildlife in this area and have heard and seen just about everything except a mountain lion. It certainly was not an elk, bobcat, coyote, dog, or cougar.  It might just possibly have been a bear-  I have had several close encounters with bears and have heard their vocalizations.  But bears do not, to my knowledge, vocalize in such a regular, loud way.  Because I heard 6 or 7 howls, I had time to really hear the sound and think about it.  To me it sounded most like an ape, though I only thought of this much later.<BR><BR>What I heard was not much of an incident. I puzzled over it for a long time.  I am reporting it here because a sasquatch is the best possible answer that I can come up with, though I did not come to that conclusion until months after the incident.  So I did a web search on bigfoot and found this site and the recordings.  Another puzzling thing though- if it was a sasquatch, that area is quite popular with people and when I go there, I usually do see someone else.  That area could be easily avoided by an animal.  Despite the abundance of wildlife as a potential food source, why would a sasquatch travel through this area at midday in the summer , howling?  The whole incident is weird... ",

    " On this particular night I was awakened by a commotion outside my bedroom window.  It sounded like animals fighting.  There are many wild animal species in the forest where I live including racoons, skunks, foxes, and elk, but also domestic animals like dogs and cats.  I assumed the noise was coming from some of these animals.  After I sat up in my bed, the noise stopped.  I lay back down, and after several minutes I heard some very peculiar noises.  First, there was a series of \"whoops\" that sounded like a cross between a monkey''s whoop and a whistle.  They seemed to be coming from different locations within about a 50 foot radius.  They were neither particularly loud, nor soft.  It sounded to me like 2 or 3 individuals.  Trying to come up with a rational candidate for the type of animal, I imagined it might be some sort of large migratory bird.  This is when I heard the second type of sound, something like a pig grunting but different.  It seemed as if there were articulation in the grunting.  It is difficult to describe, but it made my blood run cold.  The grunting seemed to come from only one animal, and was clearly audible.  This went on for perhaps a minute.  The area was then illuminated by a passing car and all sounds immediatley ceased.  Several minutes later I heard a loud \"crack\" from a large branch being broken in the woods at the edge of my yard.  I did not get out of bed or attempt to look outside as I was still quite frankly scared from the creepy nature of the grunting.  The next morning I looked around the immediate area of my yard, but found no indication of what may have made the sounds.",

I stopped and hit my gig against a tree three times. We then heard branches breaking up stream. We then crossed the creek and stopped. A rock was then thrown toward us and landed in the creek 5 yards in front of us. I advised my son and my friend we need to go, but as we turned to go back out, something very large ran toward us from up the creek bottom in the thick bushes, breaking large branches.

    "    Its taken me a long time to write this report because shortly after the incident, I managed to convince myself that it couldnt have been a bigfoot.  A few months later, a friend had a nearly identical incident at the same location which made me reconsider.  As a mechanical engineer, I am trained in the hard sciences and as such, I am a scientist.  I really dont believe in something unless there is hard evidence or the scientific community is in agreement.  Since the incident and my friends incident I have been doing a lot of research and feel that there is substantial evidence that a forest primate exists in North America.  As a scientist, my previous position was that something could exist but there was not enough evidence to prove it.  I do admit that I have always had an interest in the bigfoot phenomenon and knew some things about it like wood knocking, howls, etc.  I also took a natural anthropology class in college.  My teacher was one of the most famous anthropologist of our time and I learned well about all of the primates, the australopithecines , early hominids and of course gigantopithicus. My point is that I am an intelligent person who had an informed skeptical position concerning the bigfoot phenomenon but has come to believe that the forests are inhabited by either an early hominid or a great ape, or something in between.  I am known for my situational memory and feel that my remembrance of the incident has not diminished.  I have told my story many times and every time I get goose bumps. <BR> <BR>   It was Aug of 2010.  My wife, brother, father-in-law and I were camping on the Mogollon Rim.  We were in my favorite spot in a remote location of the Apache Sitgreaves Forest that I had been frequenting for about two years.  We were not doing any particular activities like shooting or hunting, we were not riding quads or anything.  It was a two night camping weekend for us and for the most part we were just hiking and relaxing and observing elk.  The oddest thing about this weekend was that there was almost nobody in this area of the forest, a lot of people avoid camping during the monsoon although this weekend was basically dry.  The closest campsite was about 2 miles away.  It was occupied by two older couples whom I had spoke to earlier that day of the incident.  The other notable observation was that it was a pitch black, moonless night in which it must have been overcast because I could only see about 3 to 5 feet.  In retrospect, I cannot imagine these two elderly couples creeping 2 miles into my camp, on foot, without lights, just to disturb us in our sleep.  Also, Arizonans are known for their gun toting, it is never wise to approach someones camp unannounced especially in the middle of a pitch black night.<BR><BR>   I have been an outdoorsman since I can remember and am an accomplished hunter. I am familiar with the Arizona fauna and the sounds they make.  At about 12 AM, I was awoken to the sound of two sticks cracking together near my RV trailer.  The knocking sounded as if somebody had two girthy sticks, maybe about 2 inches in diameter, and they were banging them together at a perfect 2 second interval.  Sometimes the sticks sounded a little different as if a knot had been struck but the timing was never flawed.  Now a lot of people say well that could be an elks antlers or some bird cracking his beak, but I have never heard a known animal make this sound, let alone in perfect repetition for the duration that I heard it.  But that wasnt the strangest part; the sound was translating through the forest quickly and without making additional sounds.  The sound was emanating from an area on the backside of my trailer and receding away.  It would then come closer and recede again.  This was happening over and over.  I would say that it was probably about 20 to 30 yards at the closest and went out an additional 50 to 70 yards away.  My campsite was near a primitive road and the sound seemed to parallel the road but I cant be sure.<BR>After lying in bed, listening to this for about 2 minutes, I decided that I needed to do something about this thing that was disturbing my camp.  Familiar with the observance that bigfoots knocked wood, a bigfoot did come to mind instantly, but I felt that as the patriarch, I needed to investigate and protect my family. My family members were all three asleep and I believe there may have been some snoring going on which may have given the creature some comfort to continue doing this.  I was sleeping in my underwear and decided to get dressed.  I got dressed more quietly than ever before or since and I am certain that I made no sound that the creature could hear.  I did not turn on any lights and was absolutely silent, feeling around for my clothes, shoes and pistol.<BR>Once dressed, I moved silently to the trailer door, being careful not to shake the trailer or create any noises.  This was actually quite easy because there is a door adjacent to my bed.  I waited until the cracking sound had receded as far away as it sounded like it was going to get.  And remember, the sound was emanating from the opposite side of my trailer.  I slowly opened the door, again careful not to make a noise.  The knocking sound continued. This is the part that freaks me out the most: as soon as I stepped outside, the knocking sound that seemed as far away from me as possible, stopped.  Now perhaps the trailer made a creaking sound when I put my weight on the metal step but I had the distinct feeling that something, another creature, had seen me get out of the trailer.  For some reason the door opening did not cause the sound to stop but when I got out, whatever was creating that cracking sound decided to stop even though it was 70 or 100 yards away.  I had the feeling that if something saw me, it would be beyond the rear of my trailer; the door that I just opened would have blocked the view of me from the front of the trailer.  A position to the rear would have nicely triangulated a view of me and of the wood knocking creature.  In short, I got the distinct impression that there was a second creature serving as lookout.<BR><BR>   Now the story does not stop there, I had a lousy flashlight (unlit) in one hand and my pistol in the other.  I proceeded around the front of my trailer to the other side.  Once I was on the other side, I was confronted by the pitch black woods in which I was certain that there were a couple of unknown creatures.  Having the distinct feeling that there was something to the rear of my trailer, I shinned the lousy flashlight directly towards the rear.  This only lit up the two very large pine trees that were about twelve feet in front of me.  Shining the flashlight did however elicit a response.  As soon as I shown the light, directly in front of me, but on the other side of the trees, perhaps about 20 to 40 yards away, something let out a whoop, whoop.  It was clear, it was distinct and it was amazing.  Before this incident, I had never heard on TV that bigfoot made a whoop, whoop sound, so I am certain that this was not in my head.  At that moment, I knew that there was something different from an elk, a bear, an owl, etc that was disturbing my camp.  And I also knew that there was more than one.  I felt that this was an alert call signaling any additional creatures to leave the area.<BR><BR>   During my time outside of the trailer, I was conscious of the observances that bigfoot is supposed to smell.  I specifically sniffed the air trying to get an indication of a bad smell but never smelled anything.  It was a temperate night, the air was a bit cool, probably in the low 60s but I didnt smell anything. <BR>Right after the whoop, whoop, my wife began to stir, turning on lights and going to the restroom.  I went back around the front of the trailer near the door I exited from and my wife was standing there asking me what was going on.  I told her that there is something out here, I dont know what it is, but there is something out here.  Surprisingly, maybe because I knew they were scared away, I was able to fall asleep shortly thereafter.  My wife told me that before she went back to sleep that she heard a couple of knocks too.  Of, course I had told her what I had heard and it may have been fresh on her mind as she started to fall asleep.  She did wake me to tell me, but I didnt hear anything and we both fell asleep.  My brother and father -in-law never really woke up during the incident.  I would say the incident lasted about 10 minutes from the moment I first woke up until the whoop, whoop was heard.<BR><BR>   The next day, I searched the road and any sandy areas in the area for footprints.  I am an experienced animal tracker but found no tracks.  As we discussed the event I grabbed two ponderosa pine branches that I thought approximated what I heard.  I cracked them together and it sounded fairly similar.  I experimented with different sizes and materials (oak, aspen and pine).  I felt like 2 inch diameter pine sticks with the bark removed sounded closest to what I had heard.<BR><BR>   The last week of November that same year, my friend, his dad and brother were staying in my exact same campsite hunting elk.  My friend heard the 2 second wood knocking rhythm translating through the woods just like I had for quite a few minutes.  I believe his dad and brother did not really stir.  He did not go out to confront it and it eventually stopped.<BR>",

On the early morning of 08/05/07 at about 3am I was woke in the tent by a loud knocking of wood on a tree west of camp. I lisened for about ten minutes and heard several whoop type sounds(approximately 3). These were consistent with the recordings on the website. <BR><BR>I waited for about a half hour and did not here anymore noise and fell asleep. The next day I spoke with my native american friend who was in the tent next to mine during the archery shoot. He asked if I was woke by the noises last night. I advised him what I had heard and he told me he had heard the same noises. When we got back to the remote camp we searched the area of sign, but it had rained that afternoon and we located none.<BR><BR>I have lived in Arizona all of my life and I''m 31 years old. I''m a police officer and I go in the woods on most of my days off. I''ve hunted elk, deer, bear, javalina and most all critters in my state.

    " It was a Sunday afternoon in late June 2016. I was camped in a developed USFS campground (CG) on the Coconino National Forest in central Arizona in the Mogollon Rim area. The CG is situated in an canyon within a mixed forest of spruce, fir, oak, aspen, and mainly Ponderosa pine. The cliff edge of the Rim is about 3/4 mile South of the CG.<BR><BR>I was sitting in the shade and had just finished reading a work of fiction by James Patterson which had a strange ending. I was musing about the ending and just looking West across the CG when a very fast moving dark figure crossed the CG heading from North to South. My first thought was of a large kid on a bicycle as it was moving so fast on the in camp gravel road. But its'' travel path was counter to the road. Then I realized what it was that I had seen. It was a very large Bigfoot. The sighting only lasted about three seconds and I was very lucky to have seen it at all. It crossed the CG in a shaded area and blended well into its'' background but the meadow beyond it to the West was bathed in afternoon Sunlight and backlit the dark figure. It was about 125 yards from my viewpoint so facial detail was not clear. It ran with a slight forward cant to its'' body. I noted that the head did not bob up and down like a human runners head at speed. The coat was almost black looking but with the back lighting I noticed a slight reddish tint to the figures profile as it passed by. I had not noticed its legs or arm movement.<BR><BR>Later, I went over to where the figure had crossed. On the North side of the drainage area, there was an area of crushed grass near the beginning of the travel path. Then the figure had moved South across the in camp road and had gone into a depression in the high grass. There were other areas of crushed grass along its'' suspected travel path. Also a crushed fern near the split rail fence that bordered the CG where I suspect it had stepped over, crossed the forest road, and went into thick timber. I believe the Earth depression and a row of large logs obscurred my view of its''legs as it passed by. I had only seen its'' torso from the hips up but did note that the figure did not appear to have much of a neck, if any. The torso was very thick and I guessed it was a least twice the thickness of a human. <BR><BR>It was a once in a lifetime event and as I said, I was very lucky to have seen the Sasquatch at all. Truly, an awesome event which I will carry in my minds eye forever.",

I turned off my spot light and climbed into the tent and waited to hear the steps or see a flash light for it was too dark for human to see. NOTHING!!

    " My roomate and I were moving from Austin,Tx to Olympia,Wa. We left Austin at 8:30 am and headed west driving straight through the night. Honestly it was a long day of driving which is what makes this story interesting. We were both on about six red bulls to stay alert for the long nights drive and all seemed normal. About 40 miles north of Phoenix I went around a corner and saw what I thought was a bigfoot standing motionless on the side of the road. This was a highway that had many large rocks that could look like the creature if you were tired enough however this large object had eyes that reflected off my head lights. The creature was a light brown color much like the sand and rocks it was standing around. I didn''t want my roomate to make fun of me or think I was crazy so I said nothing about my sighting and continued on for about another hour until we stopped in Kingman and bunked down for the night. Once we checked into the hotel we tried falling asleep but after drinking that much red bull neither of us could fall asleep. As we continued to try and sleep we discussed what a long day it was and my roomate remarked I was so tired I thought I saw bigfoot. He described the same location as my sighting. I rarely speak to anyone about this incident do to the fact that they think I am making it up but I know what I saw and I was not the only one. Bigfoot is indeed real.",

    " I live in Albuquerque New Mexico in the summer of 1998 during the September elk Hunt I had an experence while stalking for elk with a hunting buddy of mine I had the feeling something was near but could not tell what. I stopped and waited for a while but nothing when we started do walk again we heard a very loud and low growl and I mean a loud and low growl near by. I have been hunting far a long time now and have been in the wilderness since I was a boy and have never heard anything like this it scared my partner very much and since I was the only one armed with a firearm he did not leave my side for the rest of the day. I had an idea of what it was but kept it to myself and did not want to scare my friend more I told him it was just a bull in heat as their was cattle all through the area he kind of believed me when we got back to camp we kept the enconter to ourselves. A few other things happened that week the next day we found a bear hunting dog in camp he was very scared of something and very hungry we tried to get hold of him to check his collar but he would have nothing of it he would stay close to camp but not close enough to get him we finally had to leave him there. Also the next day I kept my eyes and ears open some of the elk rubs did not look right not till a couple of years later did I connect what I was seeing some of the them where tree twists not scrapes like an elk would do reading some books I have read say that sasquatch mark there territory this way. In 2000 I was deer hunting this time with most of the same people not in the same area while sitting around the fire I just happen to say something about bigfoot some of the people laughed but some did not so I took a chance and told them about 1998 hunting trip that night I found out the night before I got there the hunting party heard some loud screams and moans from the hill nearby it scarred them enough that they all armed themselves. Some of them to this day still do not believe but I have played a recording of sasquatch sounds for some of them and they say that was it. I know that New Mexico would not seem bigfoot country most people think of it as all desert but it is not we have one of the largest elk populations in the country and lately we are having more sittings where I herd the growl is not far from the Colorado border and two other sittings in southern NM near Ruidoso which has a large elk heard. I know what I heard and it was not anything I have heard before not a bear or big cat or a bull it almost sounded human and very powerfull it thrilled me and scare me but I know it is real and out there to think other wise would not be sensable.",

    " Hi, my name is Joe, I''m 20 years old. I recently had an encounter that was definitely unexplainable. First, let me start out by telling you the story from the very beginning. I am from Albuquerque, NM and the closest camp spots to me are in the Jemez Mountains. I have a friend who frequents the Jemez Mts. to go hunting and camping. A couple years ago my buddy told me a story about an encounter he had recently had in Jemez. He said that he had recently gone on a camping trip with his uncle Mike and his family. They went to a spot in Jemez that he called \"the meadow.\" He told me that about an hour before sun down him and his family were at the camp spot and they all hear a huge shreeking sound appx 3 or 4 hundred yards away. He told me that the sound had lasted for about 30 secs to 1 min. As he told me this he asked me the question \"What kind of animal do you know that has the lung capacity to hold a call for that amount of time?\" Him and his family were sitting around the campfire at sundown. He told me he could see the sky and there was just enough light out to see in between the trees on the ridge (the meadow is in a small valley with two ridges on either side of the camp spot). As everyone was sitting around the campfire he told me that he would look up at the ridge and see something walk upright in between the trees. He told me the being would walk back and fourth in between trees until sundown. He said he didn''t call attention to the being because his girlfriend and sisters were camping there and he didn''t want to cause a scare. He and his family go to sleep and are awakened in the middle of the night to the shreeking sound. Only this time the shreeking sound is up on one of the ridges. He said the sound was so loud that he could literally feel the bass of the sound. This shreek lasted about a minute and a half as he described it. I was very interested in this and my friend told me that the spot was originally his uncle Mike''s camp spot from when he was a little kid. I talked to his uncle Mike about the story. Uncle Mike is a backwoods hunter camper who has been all over the country to hunt. When I talked to Mike he was genuinely afraid of the campspot. He told me that he had been experiencing strange things in this campspot since he was a young boy. He recalled a time when he was seven and he was camping with his brother and his mother. He said whatever was out there scared his mother so bad that she packed camp in the middle of the night and left. He told me he wouldn''t go back. My friend and I eventually persuaded him to go camping with us. So last summer my friend, Uncle Mike, my friend''s Uncle Richard, and myself went to the very campspot where the noises were heard. We stayed five nights and heard nothing. There were noises but nothing definite. Well about a month ago I took my girlfriend to the campspot and we stayed a few nights and heard nothing. <BR><BR>This past weekend was labor day and so I took my girlfriend once again to this campspot and had a very terrifying unexplainable experience. The first night was a great night with nothing out of the ordinary. The second night was something else. My friend was camping miles away so we went and visited him. It was getting dark so I told my girlfriend that we needed to get back to camp. I drove sort of hastily back to camp and when we arrived I started the fire immediately. After I started the fire my girlfriend and I sat by it and I felt extremely tense and I didn''t know why. This went on for about an hour until my girlfriend got irritated with me. I told her I just wanted to go to bed. I packed a lot of wood on the fire and we crawled in the back of my Hummer and we went to sleep. Before I go on I want to give you a description of my campsite. I was parked facing away from the entrance of the site. There was a canopy directly behind the vehicle. Underneath the canopy was my backpack and the garbage bag (containing garbage). The campfire was about 15 ft away from the canopy with 2 chairs next to it. We are lying with our heads facing the back of the vehicle and my girlfriend is to the left of me. We go to sleep in the back of the vehicle. Some time later I wake up in the middle of the night and I am very groggy. Im looking up at the ceiling of the vehicle and can see a slight glow of the fire and then it goes out moments later. Immediately after the light goes out I hear something rub up against the vehicle on my side. I hear it until I can hear it knock over a shovel and 2 fishing poles. My adrenalin starts going fast. I don''t wake my girlfriend up because I didn''t want to scare her. I listen to this thing for about 10 min. It was very dark at this point and there was no moon out. After about 15 min total I hear the thing rub up against the vehicle again. At this point I grab my girlfriend by the back of the neck and I say in a whispering voice \"I need you to listen to me carefully, there is something outside of the hummer. I don''t know what it is. I don''t know how big it is. But something''s out there and I''m gonna get the gun.\" She says ok and I reach for my 9mm and turn it off safety. I lie there clinching my gun and her and I listened to the thing raise hell outside. I hear what sounds like tearing of cloth ripping of the trash and big footsteps and grunts. My girlfriend tells me to calm down because she can feel me trembling. Everytime my girlfriend and I hear a noise we clinch each other because we were hearing the same thing. We lie there listening to the noises for what feels like about twenty min before I start to calm down. At this point I had accepted the fact that there was a bear outside my vehicle and it was getting what it was after. The sounds are coming from next to the campfire. I hear the chairs fall over and eventually the sounds come close to the vehicle again. A couple of times I would post up on my arm to see if I could make out any kind of figure but it is too dark to see anything. The only thing I can make out is the end of the treeline. The sky was just a little brighter than the trees. I could also see a small glowing of embers from the campfire but not enough to light anything else up. I couldn''t see anything but the noises continued. I can remember saying to my girlfriend \"Our spot is gonna be a mess in the morning.\" I was trying to calm my girlfriend down because she wanted to leave. Eventually the noises started coming from her side of the vehicle. On that side was the ice chest and the dry box both full of food. It is tampering with them and it sounds like it dumped the ice chest. I turned to my girlfriend and said \"there went the ice chest.\" These noises continued for probably about five minutes. At this point I was sitting up on my heels looking out the window but could still see nothing. The next thing I hear is it touch the vehicle and a second later I hear a clang. The sound was very distinct. It was the sound of the braking of the canopy hitting the ground. I was looking out the back window and could see the sky now. It had knocked over the canopy. I say to my girlfriend \"Oh my god, it just knocked over the canopy.\" In my head I can picture a bear climb up onto the bracing of the canopy and collapse it where it stood. My girlfriend says \"did you see that thing?\" Assuming that she was asking if I could see it I said \"no I can''t see anything.\" She starts crying hysterically but not to loud. She says \"I''m not ok I wanna leave now.\" I say ok and clinch my gun as I crawl into the driver seat. I sit for a couple of seconds before I started the vehicle because I didn''t know what would happen when I did. I then start the vehicle and turn right to make a U turn and drive out of there. I see no kind of animal or living thing. I drive about 10 min until I hit the main rode. I park there and my girlfriend is still in the back crying. I crawl back there to console her. We \"slept\" on the main rode until sunrise. We both woke around 730 am and start talking about it and it was then that she said \"I saw the thing\" I said what? She said \"Don''t you remember me saying did you see that thing?\" I said ya and she went on to tell what she saw. Keep in mind she was lying down the entire time and refused to sit up. She said she was lying down looking up at the sky which was lighter than everything else. She was looking out the side window (which was where it was at at the end). She said as soon as the canopy hit the ground she saw something black fly past the window. She said it was taller than the top of the window and headed back the direction it originally came from which just so happened to be away from all the main roads. My hummer is about six feet and if she was lying down looking up and sees something taller than the top window. Whatever it was had to have been 7 ft plus. After our conversation we agreed to go back up to the campspot to collect our things which was the canopy, the chairs, the cooler, the dry box, the shovel, the fishing polls, my backpack, and the garbage. We head back up to the campspot and finally arrive. I was chilled to the bone when I arrived. There was not a thing out of place. There were only two things visibly wrong with the campspot. The chairs were knocked over and the canopy was turned upside down about 20 feet from where it was standing. I want you to know there was no wind that night. Now if a bear got to this canopy it would have been collapsed and torn. But what this meant to me was that whatever knocked over my canopy had to have picked it up and thrown it 20 feet. I put on my shoes which I had left there the night prior and started scouring the area. The trash which was open and not tied the night before was not tampered with. My backpack was right where I left it. The cooler and the dry box were in the exact same spot and we never really took an inventory of their contents the night prior so we could not tell if there was anything missing. This scared the hell out of me because it meant that whatever was there had the dextarity to rummage through everything and do whatever it did and leave it the way it was found. We packed up and left. I want whoever reads this to know that I don''t drink and I have never touched drugs. What happened to me that night was not \"just the wind\" but it was very real. I have never before in my life felt terror like that and numerous times through writing you my story I have broken out in tears because I hate to relive it. There are only certain people that I have told this story to because I don''t want to sound crazy. I really hope I hear from you so I can attempt to make some sense of what I''ve been through. When I first heard my friend''s stories I didn''t doubt them and they made me very curious. But going to the campsite three times and not experiencing anything just made me think whatever was up there is no longer up there. I know better now. ",

    " This is the third in a set of chronological reports that I am submitting regarding a series of encounters I had between 1970 and 1983 in Nevada, California, and Washington States.<BR><BR>This third encounter occurred in August 1972, when I was 12, at my home, roughly ten days after our encounter at the dry wash.  <BR><BR>I have previously described nearby Peavine Mountain and Lemmon Valley.  Our house was located on the East side of the valley.  It was in a new development at the time, tucked back in a draw among several steep hills.  The surrounding hills rose from 50 to 250 feet above our neighborhood and were primarily granite outcroppings.  The soil was coarse granite sand interspersed with boulders of various sizes.  Where there was vegetation on the hills, it was predominantly sagebrush.  In the draws, the sand was less coarse and there were a variety of grasses and other weeds.<BR><BR>We had just moved into the newly completed house a few weeks earlier and were getting to know our neighbors, all of whom had just moved into their new homes as well.  Like many of our neighbors, we were building a fence and otherwise improving our property.  At the time, there was only one thing to detract from the new neighborhood -- the presence of a pack of feral dogs.<BR><BR>The pack was composed of four large dogs -- two Dobermans and a couple of mixed breeds.  They were a matter of some concern because many of the new residents had small children and the pack displayed absolutely no trace of fear of people.  They would generally appear around dusk, when it began to cool, and boldly range through the neighborhood.  At night you could often hear them in the surrounding hills, barking and baying occasionally.  It didn''t take long to determine that they had no owner and one of our neighbors, an animal control officer for the city of Reno, told us that he had arranged for the county to do something about them.<BR><BR>Our home was an \"L\" shaped ranch, with two of four bedrooms in the back, at the top of the \"L\", and a garage in front, at the bottom right of the \"L\", facing the street.  We had partially constructed a cedar plank fence around the property, starting in back and working our way around the property clockwise.  We had completed the fence on the side of the property at the top of the \"L\", and had built a small section of fence connecting the back left corner of the \"L\" to the fence on that side.  This created a small cul-de-sac behind the house.  Along the side of the property to the right of the \"L\", we had set the posts and rails.  Along the front, where we intended to connect it to the garage, at the lower right corner of the \"L\", we had set the posts, but hadn''t yet put in the rails.  You could, essentially, walk right into our back yard from the street side of the house, but could not leave the yard on the back side without climbing over the fence.<BR><BR>On the night of the encounter, I had picked up all of the two-by-fours we hadn''t used as rails yet and I had stacked them horizontally along the base of the fence back in the cul-de-sac.  This was a precaution since they were pilferable and we weren''t the only ones building a new fence.<BR><BR>My bedroom was at the top, right corner of the \"L\".  The ground outside my window was about a foot and a half below the floor of my room.  My mother had already planted a small flowerbed of marigolds there.  To protect it, she had me put in one of those small, white-painted, wire trellises that reminds you of a bunch of coat-hangers welded together.  To put it in I had to heavily wet down the ground, then force it in.  Once the ground dried, the powdered granite and sand set like concrete.  It was about a foot high.<BR><BR>The incident occurred between midnight and 12:30 am.  It was late summer and I was awake late reading.  I had my window open, but the drapes were closed.  That night, the pack of feral dogs had been more noisy than usual.  Every so often, their barking would become particularly strident, drawing my attention away from my book.  I remember thinking to myself, over the course of fifteen minutes or so, that they were chasing another jackrabbit, then deciding that it must be a coyote, since they''d been going at it for longer than usual, then wondering if they might have a cougar at bay, since they were still barking and baying loudly, but seemed stationary.  <BR><BR>I was just turning back to my book, when I realized that they had started moving again, and were coming down the street in the direction of the house.  I started to sit up, intending to go to the living room window to see what they were chasing, but realized that they would be well past the house before I could get to the living room in front.  As I listened, though, the noise of the pursuit didn''t decrease the way I expected it to do as they chased their quarry past the opposite side of the house.  Instead it grew louder, and I realized that, whatever they were chasing, they were chasing it into our back yard.  I also realized that they might corner it behind the house in the cul-de-sac.  Excited, I started to get up to look out the window.<BR><BR>Before I could get up, though, their quarry rounded the back right corner of the garage heading in the direction of my bedroom at the back right corner of the house.  For just a second, I could clearly hear it running, as the sound of the dogs was still partially masked around the corner of the garage.  As it covered the twenty feet between the two corners, I heard three distinct, heavy footfalls -- one just as it rounded the garage, one midway between the garage and the corner of the house, and the third just under my window, where the wire trellis was set firmly into the ground.  This was followed by an incredible impact into the corner of the house.  The force was so great that I could hear the four-by-four upright in the wall crack and the whole room shook.  The impact and cracking sound came from a point about five and a half feet above the level of the ground outside.  Simultaneously, there was a secondary impact about seven feet above ground level across the top right corner of my window as viewed from outside.  The window rattled violently in the frame and I was sure it was cracked.  Immediately following the two simultaneous impacts, there was a forced grunt as if the wind had been knocked out of whatever it was and I could hear its body fall heavily to the ground.<BR><BR>My first thought was, \"Oh my God!  They''re chasing a man!\"  The footfalls were clearly bipedal, the height of the impacts was too high for it to be anything four-legged, and the sound of it having its wind knocked out was manlike, if somewhat heavy.  Also from the sound of its fall, it went from an erect to a prone position.  At the same time I recognized that something was strange.  The \"man\" hadn''t called for help, hadn''t made any vocal noises at all, in fact.  He had covered twenty feet in what was essentially two strides, and had hit the house at a point too high for all but the largest of men.  The secondary impact across the outside corner of the window was also too high for most people to reach, and the force of the impact, strong enough to make the four-by-four in the house''s frame crack, indicated much more mass than any normal person would have.<BR><BR>I didn''t spend any time really thinking about this, though.  Even though I had an underlying uneasiness because the sounds indicated that the guy was huge, I was sure the dogs were chasing a man.  The dogs closed on the man, snarling and barking.  I was afraid he was lying on the ground, injured or unconscious, and I realized that I had to do something.  I immediately threw my sheet off, jumped out of bed, and reached for the drapes, intending to throw them open and yell at the dogs -- about all I could do in the situation.  In the two or three seconds it took to do this, though, it didn''t sound like the dogs were mauling the man.  They were about three feet from the house, stationary, barking and growling.  It sounded as if there were only three of them, two very aggressive and ready to attack, and one that was barking the way a dog would if it were afraid of you, but ready to attack if provoked.<BR><BR>Just as my fingertips touched the drapes, the scariest thing I have ever experienced in my life happened (believe me, this is saying a lot for someone who has spent nineteen years in the military and lived through a parachute malfunction).  Somehow the man had recovered from hitting the house, having the wind knocked out of him, and falling.  He had somehow managed to stand up and get his breath back and just as I touched the drapes, from a point immediately outside my window, level with and about two feet from my head, He Growled Back at the dogs.<BR><BR>The growl wasn''t loud.  It was only about two and a half seconds long.  But it was the meanest, deepest, and most menacing growl I have ever heard in my life (to include those of trapped brown bears at Yellowstone).  It was almost as if he was keenly aware that there were people around, that he knew precisely how long he had to growl to get his point across, and that he didn''t want to make any more noise than he absolutely had to.<BR><BR>For the next several seconds there was absolute silence.  He didn''t make any more noise.  The dogs didn''t even make any sounds of movement.  And I was frozen in fear and shock, praying that he wouldn''t notice I was there, and afraid he would hear me if I moved at all.    <BR><BR>It was like that for several long seconds, then, all but silently, I heard him step and brush around the corner of the house.  <BR><BR>A second later the dogs were after him, but the head start was all he needed.  I heard the stack of two-by-fours tumble down and the sound of him hitting the six foot cedar fence as he went over it, followed by the dogs hitting the fence and then scratching at it and barking.  After a few moments the dogs stopped trying to get over the fence and raced back around the house clockwise.  <BR><BR>As I heard the dogs racing down the street, I relaxed slightly and gulped for breath.  I hadn''t even realized I''d been holding it.  I immediately choked.  The \"Thing\" had left an incredible stench.  It was overpowering.  It smelled like a combination of wet dog, stale urine, and rancid sweat.  There was also an acrid component a little like burnt rubber.  It was so bad that I staggered away from the window.<BR><BR>I stood there for a few moments trying to decide what to do.  The thing was gone, the dogs were gone, and all I would accomplish by waking my parents would be to anger my father.  I decided it wasn''t worth it.  I thought about going outside but really didn''t want to poke around out there in the dark.  I was struggling with what I had just experienced.  Whatever had been outside my window was manlike, but clearly was not a man.  I had no frame of reference to place it in.  I didn''t relate the experience to my encounter at the dry wash because I had so thoroughly convinced myself that that had been a man.  I closed my window (which to my amazement was not broken), got back in bed, and tried to read to get my mind off of the incident.  Eventually I fell asleep.<BR><BR>The next morning I woke after my father had left for work.  I looked out my window and could see that the flowerbed -- trellis and all -- had been flattened.  I got dressed and went outside.  The ground was scuffed but there were no distinctive footprints.  I choked down my apprehension and walked back into the fenced cul-de-sac behind the house.  The stack of two-by-fours was lying there toppled.  I looked at the cedar fence.  The scratch marks from the dogs'' nails were clear.  Caught on the top of one of the planks was a tuft of coarse hair.  I stepped up on the lower rail of the fence and looked at it closely in the bright morning sunlight.  It was dark black with hints of brownish red highlights and about three inches long.  It had enough oil on it make it shine if you looked at it closely.  I struggled with whether it had come from the \"thing\" or one of the dogs.  After several moments of consideration I decided it was possible one of the Dobermans could have had some three inch strands of hair, that the colors were within the appropriate range, and that one of the dogs might actually have managed to make it over the fence to leave it there.  I left it where it was.  <BR><BR>I went back to the window and examined it and the siding on corner of the house closely.  I didn''t see any damage from the impacts.  I decided that the thing had been running, hadn''t seen the trellis, and had tried to cut around the corner of the house too closely.  The trellis, strongly embedded in the cement-like soil, tripped it and it fell, throwing its left arm(?) up in an attempt to maintain balance (or maybe grab the roof to catch itself).  The primary impact would have been from its body.  The secondary impact could have been from the left arm slapping the side of the house across the corner of the window.  <BR><BR>I went in and told my mother about the incident.  I was still very troubled and wanted to know what I had heard.  I discussed it at length with my father when he got home.  He was uncharacteristically patient and explained that it had either been a bear or a cougar.  I couldn''t accept either of these explanations.  It wasn''t until about a year later that I ran across a tourist pamphlet in Oregon that was about Bigfoot.  I can''t express how relieved I was at the time to learn that there was a potential explanation for what I had experienced.<BR><BR>We never saw or heard the dogs again after that night.",

    " \"The Zoobies\" -- 1992 interview with Sgt. Doug Huse, San Diego County Sheriffs Department<BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Okay, just go ahead and tell me about yourself, when you started working there and so on. <BR><BR>HUSE: I started working the Alpine area (east of San Diego, California) in March of 1970. I came to the department the previous year. I was working out there in a patrol capacity for the San Diego County Sheriff''s Department I was a deputy at the time and actually worked Alpine for about 2 years, from March of 1970 to April of 1972. As far as trying to recall exactly when this went down, the best I can come up with is that it was after the Laguna fire of 1970 ... September of 1970. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: The Laguna fire affected which areas?<BR><BR>HUSE: Well, it was the largest brush fire at the time in California history, and burned specifically in the Sweetwater River area from east of Alpine all the way south and west, probably another 15 miles. It was quite an extensive burn and through the area in question, Alpine, on the south side of Interstate 8. To recall the chain of events, it was extremely cold which means the time of year would''ve been sometime after September of 1970, probably December or January, maybe February...let''s see, that would be 1971 ... well, it was definitely winter. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Was that about the time of your first contact with the key witness, Dr. Baddour (prominent San Diego psychiatrist)? <BR><BR>HUSE: Yes, and I don''t recall the reason, but Dr. Baddour was stopped by a two-man patrol unit. Baddour was traveling eastbound, which would''ve been from the San Diego area to what we learned later was his home in Alpine. On the front seat of his car, I don''t remember what kind of car it was, he had a loaded .44 magnum revolver with a 6-inch barrel. That''s the same type of gun that Dirty Harry made famous. It''s the largest caliber hand gun you can buy. Of course this piqued our interest a little bit. I wasn''t the contact, I was what we call the cover during this particular stop. My partner''s the one who made first contact and found the gun. He secured the revolver and was asking the doctor, who''d identified himself as Dr. Baddour, why he was carrying the weapon. Baddour said it was because of a ... and I don''t know what he actually said at the time, but my partner heard him say, \"Zoobie,\" ... and so from there on all our conversations throughout the department referred to whatever Dr. Baddour had seen as a Zoobie. That wasn''t what the doctor actually called it, I don''t believe, but that''s what my partner heard and that''s how the name got coined.<BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: At the time did Dr. Baddour describe this Zoobie to the officer? <BR><BR>HUSE: Yes, he did, to both of us as a matter of fact. He described the Zoobie as a large, upright, walking hairy creature. Dr. Baddour convinced us and later other members of my department, including one of my patrol sergeants, that in truth he''d had three separate encounters with the Zoobies. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Did Dr. Baddour say how many of these Zoobies there were and where the sightings happened? <BR><BR>HUSE: Yeah, one sighting was made by his entire family within the confines of his yard and immediate area, and at one time they saw three Zoobies. What Dr. Baddour described to us was what he assumed was a father, mother and child with the largest of the Zoobies being over 6 feet tall, maybe 7 feet tall. The tallest was very hairy and much larger-framed than an ordinary man. What he described as the mother was about 5 feet tall, and the smaller one was about 3 or 4 feet tall. Like I said, the doctor convinced a number of us that he''d in fact seen something unusual. What happened then was that we did get involved in an investigation of the sightings. I did because of the shift I worked which was either 10 p.m. at night to 6 a.m., or what we called the evening or overlap shift which was from 6 p.m. to 2:30 in the morning. Neither of those shifts was conducive to interviewing citizens in the area, so I wasn''t able to locate other witnesses, and I can''t recall if I ever talked, to a deputy who canvassed the area looking for witnesses. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: How many people lived in the area at the time? <BR><BR>HUSE: There were very few homes, probably 5 or no more than 6 residences, and Baddour''s was the last home on the narrow road. Going back in my memory 20 years now, I''d say his house was a quarter to a third of a mile off the main road used to get to his place, almost in a straight line due south of Alpine Blvd. That area hasn''t grown much since then, no planned residential development in there. At that time the Baddour family themselves consisted of the doctor, his wife, a daughter and a son. The daughter was 17 and the son was younger, maybe 13 or 14. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Can you describe what the terrain looks like, is it actually alpine forest, etc.?<BR><BR>HUSE: It''s not a forest by any means, the elevation''s no more than 2300 feet. The road goes east and up, and in about another 20 miles it eventually climbs to about 5000 feet. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Does it continue up into forested areas? <BR><BR>HUSE: Yes it does and it follows the Sweetwater River it''s about 10 miles. The Sweetwater River isn''t much of a flowing river. It runs about three-quarters of a mile south of Dr. Baddour''s place. Of course it always depended on rainfall, but the river hasn''t run continuously anytime in the 20 years I''ve been familiar with the area. There''s no snowfall at all. The terrain itself is quite steep behind Dr. Baddour''s property, going down into the (Sweetwater) river bottom itself. It''s all primarily brush and chaparral.<BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Any bears in the area? <BR><BR>HUSE: I don''t think I''ve ever heard of a bear sighting in San Diego county, and again I''ve been in the area almost 23 years. We have deer everywhere here along with coyotes and fox and other types of wildlife, but no bears. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: What else do you remember about Dr. Baddour''s sightings? <BR><BR>HUSE: Let''s see, the first set of circumstances I remember was Dr. Baddour finding damage to the house when he''d just moved in. He said he bought the house from an older German couple and all of the light bulbs, inside and out, were the yellow bug repellent type. Baddour said the German man told me that he shouldn''t change them to white, that he should get used to the yellow light.<BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Because of an insect problem? <BR><BR>HUSE: Baddour said the German was very evasive about that, evasive also about a lot of details regarding the house and property. The property did have some acreage, I don''t recall the size but it was larger than a city lot anyway. The property had some fruit trees in the front and back yards. I don''t remember what kind of fruit trees they were, but the house and trees were surrounded by a fence. One of Baddour''s complaints was that fruit was being picked off the trees at the tops, but not from the bottoms. The trees were upward of 7 or 8 feet high, or maybe 10 feet high. Anyway, the fruit was disappearing from the tops of his trees and his fence was getting knocked down. He had a wind chime at one of the doors made of brass or some kind of strong metal which frequently rang in the blowing wind, and at one point the wind chime suddenly turned up flattened. Baddour couldn''t explain it and we couldn''t duplicate it. It was smashed. Baddour did make a plaster cast of a footprint and I know we had photographs of it, if we didn''t in fact have a plaster cast of the print ourselves. But I do recall there was a plaster cast. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Do you remember the approximate size of the footprint? <BR><BR>HUSE: I''m 6-foot-3 and I wear a size 12 shoe, and I''d have to say this one was larger than my shoe and much wider than my foot. I''d say it was about 13 or 14 inches in length, and I''ve been wracking my brain trying to remember if it had 4 toes or 5 toes, but I just can''t recall.** <BR><BR>[**According to researcher, Ken Coon, who visited the Alpine area in 1971, Dr. Baddour''s \"Zoobies\" left V -shaped, 4-toed footprints, 16 inches long and 8 inches wide with the widest measurement across the toes. The foot narrowed down to 5 inches at the heel.]<BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: But there''s some recollection that it might have had an usual number of toes? <BR><BR>HUSE: Yes, I do seem to remember that, but I can''t bring it to mind. I know the footprint was wide overall, and less wide at the heel, but the heel was still wider than a human foot would be. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Did you or any of the officers talk to the doctor''s wife or kids?<BR><BR>HUSE: Specifically the word came back to me, and I''m not sure which deputy found out, but the daughter said she had a sighting in the early morning hours as she boarded a school bus at Alpine Blvd. That would have been adjacent to the access road leading to the Baddour house. She was getting on the bus and spotted the creature off in the brush. There''s some very thick, very tall brush along the road there. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Do you remember any details of what she saw? <BR><BR>HUSE: No, not really, the man who was deeply involved in this was my patrol sergeant and he''s now deceased. He was so involved with it that on his days off he''d go up there and camp to the rear of Baddour''s house. He''d take his older son along and the two of them would camp out in hope of getting a glimpse of one of the Zoobies. They never did. But he was the man who probably had more conversations with the doctor than any-body else. Another sighting involved three Zoobies sighted by a whole family. The Baddours had made it a habit to never go out after dark, but one night they were out with the son to call in their pet dog. In the dark the boy thought he saw the dog near a comer of the house and called out to It. Well, the dog came running back, but from a different corner, and what at first they thought was the dog turned out to be the smaller Zoobie. Apparently it had been laying down and it got up and stood and walked the opposite way, joining the other two, the larger male and female, and they all walked off into the brush.<BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Did they ever use words like \"ape\" or \"gorilla\" to describe the creatures? <BR><BR>HUSE: No, they never did. Baddour was firm in his own mind that it wasn''t an ape or gorilla. It was something totally different than one of those. Well, for lack of anything better we thought it to be more like the California Bigfoot, based on how it was described. Whether it was black or brown I really can''t remember.<BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Did Dr. Baddour ever use the word Bigfoot or Sasquatch to describe the Zoobie? <BR><BR>HUSE: Not to me, no. As a matter of fact we were assigned to make periodic checks of his residence throughout the night because most of the damage to his property was done during the night time, so my partner and I in a two-man car would drive up there and shine the spotlight around his house. Dr. Baddour was very convincing. I can still picture him coming outdoors one night dressed in his skivvies and wearing black high top military boots. That was it, a tee-shirt and shorts with those black boots and carrying that big .44 magnum. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: How would you characterize the family, it sounds as though they were all educated, credible people? <BR><BR>HUSE: Yes, I''d characterize them as exactly that. I got the impression the daughter was very intelligent, and of course Baddour himself was a medical doctor, a psychiatrist. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: In our earlier phone call to arrange this interview you mentioned something about the creatures, the Zoobies, mimicking human speech ... ?<BR><BR>HUSE: Yes, one of the lighter stories I recall happened when the doctor got home after dark one night. They had chickens there, and earlier he''d called his wife to say he was going to be late and to remind her to feed the chickens before night fall, which she did. When the doctor got home he had to exit his car, open the gate, drove through and stopped, then got out of the car again to close the gate behind him. He said that when he went to close the gate that night he heard a very low, very guttural voice say, ''Here chicky, chicky, chicky...'' <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: That''s funny and not unprecedented in the research. Are you saying the impression was that one of the creature''s was imitating the doctors wife who''d called in the chickens earlier?<BR><BR>HUSE: Exactly. It was the doctor''s opinion, and we had no reason to doubt him, that the Zoobie had some type of intelligence and the capability of producing sounds like that. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Did they ever describe any other sounds or smells, anything like that? <BR><BR>HUSE: Smells, yes. A very pungent odor, maybe like rotting garbage. You know, he did tell us he''d set up cameras around the house with trip-wires, but he wasn''t able to get any photographs, at least not while I was working the area. I really can''t recall but I know the doctor himself had a close sighting of one of the Zoobies, and there were probably other sightings, but I can''t remember now. Of course I worked up there for just those two years, until April of 1972. After that I went to fly helicopters. So I was completely out of touch with what was happening in Alpine, and I didn''t get back there until 1981. At that time I was stationed east of the Baddour home, and I didn''t hear anything more. I did hear something about the Proctor Valley Monster when I started patrol in 1970, which if true I''d have to assume was on the order of what Dr. Baddour was describing. Now, a few years ago a deputy told me he saw a dark-colored, large, upright furry creature, not a bear and not human, up in some rocks north of Interstate 8, and possibly northwest of El Capitan (reservoir). The deputy told me it was a good distance away. Also, I was involved in a juvenile diversion camp (near Julian, northeast of Alpine), and a couple of counselors from another camp came down and told us they''d see something they couldn''t identify in the mountains. After talking with them it was concluded that what they''d seen was probably a Zoobie. Another thing we found out, during our investigation of Dr. Baddour''s sightings, was that the Viejas Indians (reservation) just north of Interstate 8 had a legend about a giant hairy man that was the protector of their burial grounds, and those burial grounds were located just about 2 miles north of where Dr. Baddour lived.",

    " Two years ago while camping at the lake (without permission) we were walking at the south-western inflow to the lake (a seasonal creek.) The water level of the lake was high due to the El Nino rains and the \"creek\" extended out from the lake covering the dirt road with about two feet of water.<BR><BR>Three of us were returning from climbing Boundary Peak when we had to take our shoes off to wade across the creek. Our footprints were clear and distinct in the silty/sandy bottom -- however, near the other side we saw a set of footprints that looked like someone had walked into the water and then back out. These footprints were about the same size as ours, however, they were blurred and had kind of fuzzy marks all around. They had not been there when we had crossed the same spot an hour before.<BR><BR>We all commented about how weird they looked. Later that evening when we sat around our campfire a U.S. Border Patrol Agent stopped by to chat. He had been dragging some old tires along the dirt roads near the border so that he could return later to see if any illegal aliens had crossed the border at that point. We told him about the weird tracks we had seen and he said: \"Oh, yeah, we call him Little Foot -- ''cause the prints aren''t big enough to be a Big Foot. Nobody''s seen him, though.\" The Agent went on to say that everybody in his office just thought it was a Mexican with hairy feet.",

    " My wife and I were camping in the Cleveland National Forest, Mount Laguna area. [East of San Diego] The campground is called Burnt Rancheria.  <BR><BR>It was exactly 3:14am. My wife woke me up because she needed to use the restroom really bad.  The restroom was about 50 yards away and she was afraid to go alone.  As I was putting on my shoes, I started hearing sounds that reminded me of an ax hitting wood (or a tree), but louder.  It wasnt like someone was cutting wood, because the sounds were not in rapid succession, they were 2 or 3 seconds apart. In total I think I heard 4 or 5 of them.  I put on my shoes, stepped out of my tent, and kept hearing them, finally realizing that they sounded like the knocking sounds described by people who have reported bigfoot encounters.  <BR><BR>After about 5 seconds they stopped, and (I dont know if this was just my imagination or not) I started to hear echoes of voices.  I say voices because it sounded like someone talking but at the same time it was gibberish with grunts.  <BR><BR>The next day my sister in law, who was camping with us, started to give us a hard time about all the noise we were making getting out of the tent and going to the rest room.  So I asked her if she heard the knocking sounds she said she did. She described them as someone dropping a heavy rock on a ply wood.  I asked my wife if she heard them but she said she was still half asleep and trying not to wet herself.

We all wanted to camp in a bigfoot area, so we we went to a campground near Bluff Creek.  We were all in the tent and in our bags, the camp had settled down and all of a sudden there was a whoop! They were loud as if behind us, in succession whoop whoop bah-whoop!! And it seemed that there was more than one, I estimate three, one to the left of us, one behind us, and one off in front at a distance.  Also, something either took a large step or jumped off something, and it was big. The one behind us would call first and the one off in the distance would call back. The one to the left would whoop once, but the one behind would whoop three times and the others once or twice. At the start of the whoops would be almost a pucker or click sound. I figure the one behind us was the lead because he would call out and they would answer. <BR><BR>After about ten minutes the lead creature started to move off with the one to the left towards the other. I wanted to look out the tent but my youngest was with me who is 6 and was real scared, because the calls were so loud. I stayed with him and did not get to look till it was over. <BR><BR> I found no evidence in the morning, but earlier that day I noticed there were markings on a tree that was not made by a bear, almost as if the bark had been picked off.

In my life time I never heard a wild animal that could make an awful sound like that. <BR><BR>Ive heard through the years about this big foot stuff, and Im not sure what this thing was, but while I was at the window looking I could hear foot steps in the leaves.<BR><BR>It made the sound three times, so I made a mad cat fighting sound, and it was then that I heard the foot steps leave my yard and I know that it was human steps and not animal sounding steps. <BR><BR>I went back to bed, but I could not forget that sound. A friend called the next day and I was telling them about it.  He told me there was some guys on the news who had found a dead big foot back east.  He told me to go to your web site for pictures, so I did for fun.  I looked at all of the pictures and listened to the different sounds, and when I got to the last sounds on your site page, I freaked out, because that was the same sound that I heard that morning.<BR><BR>The next night it was back again, but this time I saw out my window this hairy thing which was very-very tall. I have been freaked out ever since, and I cant sleep, because this thing is very upsetting.<BR><BR>",

    " I was camping with my wife and friends from the 23rd to the 24th of August, 2008. My wife and I shared a campsite and our friends shared a campsite, with 2 tents, on a second campsite about 50ft. away from us. I had drank no alcohol before going to bed so I slept fairly lightly.<BR><BR>I awoke at 4:50am. Just as I awoke, I heard a loud sound that seemed to me to be someone hitting a treetrunk with a large branch. I lifted my head in the tent and looked around for any light sources and saw none. I also heard no voices. I was intrigued enough to continue listening. Our closest neighbor had a Dachsund and the next closest had two larger dogs that were tied up outside their tent. Once I heard the first loud sound the outside dogs started moving around but didn''t bark. They made some moaning sounds but that''s all.<BR><BR>From what I could tell, as far as sounds, something or someone walked through the campground from lower to higher through a ravine. It had very heavy footsteps. It sounded like it broke fairly large branches on the ground. Once it crossed the campground''s asphalt, the neighboring dogs started crying, whimpering and moaning. I then heard what sounded like a rock or something similar, being thrown against a tree near our tent and falling to the ground. Right at the crescendo of the crunching branches I decided to get up and unzip our tent window and at the same time the tent of the owners of the dogs opened and a woman came out and grabbed the dogs to quiet them down. That was the last I heard of the crunching, footstep sounds. Also, there had been crickets making noise all night until this event. Once this started, the cricket noise reduced to only crickets at a great distance. By the end of the incident there were no forest sounds at all.<BR><BR>The next morning, we walked over to the ravine that I thought I had heard the biped walking through and found no footprints due to the extremely dry ground. I spoke to a family right next to the ravine and they had heard nothing that night but had heard footsteps the night before. The husband/father is a hunter and told me that he had seen bears 2 or 3 times in the past in those mountains but had never seen them down in the campgrounds in that area.<BR><BR>Mountain lions are fairly common in those mountains, but what I heard seemed to be heavier than a mountain lion. Plus, whatever animal I heard sounded like it had two feet as opposed to four.<BR><BR>I later found out that one of our friends had heard footsteps around his tent at about 4am. He thought it was our other two friends, camping with us, playing a joke on him.",

    " My family and I were at The Golden Trout Wilderness Packing Station in the lower Sierra''s over the labor day weekend. We were there for horse back riding which we have done for the past 4 years. The time was approximately 4PM when my wife, son, daughter, Sierra(daughter of the owner of the pack station), and myself became aware of a high pitched \"whooping\" call coming from a distance down the forestry access road approaching the station. The kids started to call back in the same manner. We all guessed it was an approaching hiker or horse back rider approaching the station and calling out for fun. The calling continued for the next 15-20 minutes and was percieved as getting closer. My son became bored with the game and went on to something else to do. The calling continued and I observed that it passed the station and finally grew faint towards the trail head entering a section of the golden trout wilderness area. My daughter went to the access road just adjacent to the mule packing platform to greet the caller upon their arrival. The call grew louder and that was the reason for her appearence at the road at that time. She observed a being and was afraid of what she saw. When I asked later that evening whom had come down the road she was timid in her response. I thought this odd and continued to question her. She was afraid to tell us what she saw because she thought we would accuse her of lying. She has just turned eight. Her description was as follows with little lead in by myself or my wife. We are both physicians and trained in the scientific method. We tried or best not to \"bait\" her answers: The thing was bigger than me (>7 foot) and had a long beard. When I asked her what he was wearing she answered nothing. I then asked her what color was his skin and she answered that she could not tell because he was covered with hair. All over I asked, yes, all over. I then asked if his arms were short or long. She answered long. I asked did he see you and her answer was no. I asked if he made the sound we had been hearing and she stated not at the time she saw him. I then described three different gait patterns by example and she picked the long stride and lumbering type verses the noraml human gait or small steps. She stated that he had a big mouth and walked quickly. She was brief and direct with her answers and I believe she saw something not typically human in form. She has no imaginary friends and has been taught that lying will only hurt the one who lies. I was a bit spooked and fearful for my family''s safety for the rest of the night.",

    " It was the summer of 1986 and I was camping with a friend in a small campsite where we had been several times before. It was a few hundred yards off the road before Fish Creek campground, near Troy Meadows area on the Kern Plateau, up the road from Kennedy Meadows. The public campground was about 1  miles as the crow flies from us. I believe it was a Wednesday so there were not many other campers on the mountain, and we were on the first day of a motorcycle riding trip. We had spent the day gathering wood, setting up tents and testing out our old motorcycles. Two friends were to join us the next day.<BR><BR>As my friend Bob and I settled in around the campfire, we talked of the loop we were planning to ride the next day. We were camped in a clearing in the trees. There was a large meadow 100 yards on the other side of the trees. Bobs dog Duke, a large male Irish setter, was taking turns getting petted. It was getting late and we were winding down. <BR><BR>Just then we heard it. The sound was part yell, part growl. It was extremely loud and echoed through the valley. Only a very large pair of lungs could have produced the loud, high tones and deep throaty growl. This sound struck fear in me that I will never forget. It continued for several minutes and seemed to be at the edge of the meadow. It is hard to describe the intensity of the sound. The best I can do is to say that it started off sounding like the yell of a howler monkey, fading into the deep growl of an enraged grizzly bear.<BR><BR>We stoked up the fire without saying a word to each other. Next we heard a branch break just outside the light of the campfire. I looked at Duke and saw him staring at the area where I had heard the branch break. He was shaking from head to toe. Next we heard leaves move about fifty feet over from the last sound. The dog turned straight at it. Again, it was just out of the light of the fire. Bob and I were scared like never before. Our fear was emphasized by the fact that his large male dog was frozen in fear, fixed on one area in the darkness. By the look in his eyes, I believe he could see what we could not. <BR><BR>Several minutes later, the dog slowly broke his stare for a minute. Bob and I were able to talk after this point. All we could come up with to explain the noises was that it was large, not a bear, and very angry by the sound of it. We never calmed down that night. We abandoned the tents and both slept in Bobs Ford Bronco, Bob with his 357 lying across his chest. The next day, we waited until we heard other cars and far off bikes before we started really walking around. Later our friends arrived and we kept the camp loud all of the next night. <BR><BR>I have camped, hunted, fished and rode dirt bikes for my whole life. I have played it cool with bears outside my tent and seen a lot of the backcountry. I also work in the outdoors. I have never heard an animal like what we heard that one night. <BR><BR>",

    " September 29, 2008 Im in the mountains above Kernville for opening weekend deer hunting season. I decided to spend the evening on a high mountain ridge so I would not have to climb the mountain in the dark the next morning. I hiked in the afternoon before and pitched my tent just before dark. I pitched my tent on a ridge just down from a high mountain pass. <BR><BR>Just before going to sleep I was standing outside my tent and I heard a loud noise behind me. The noise was within forty feet of my position, and I would describe it as a single pop sound. Ill try to spell out the sound, but there is no way I can reproduce the sound! Pooeekk. It could have been a branch being broken off of a tree but it would have had to come off at the base of the branch where it meets the tree trunk. The tree would have to be slightly hollow to get the sound. <BR><BR>There was no noise after the initial sound and nothing ever hit the ground. My first impression of the sound was that it was a warning and I thought it was more of an animal sound, because it had a hollow guttural tone to the pop sound. I dismissed the occurrence and had no other problems through the night. <BR><BR>The next morning I got up before sun up and started stocking along the tree line heading toward the mountain pass. After about 75 yards I moved into the trees and sat for some time looking over a meadow. Once I finished my time there I walked in the trees for twenty feet and then I moved out of the trees and back in the open. <BR><BR>Just as I stepped out of the trees I spotted a large foot print. It was very large and I could make out two toes at the top left of the print. At this point I took out my cell phone and snapped a picture of the foot print. The foot print was as long as my boot, 13 long plus the toes and 2 wider than my boot on the side. I could make out a ridge in the dirt where the ball of the heal and the middle of the foot come together. <BR><BR>After taking the picture I resumed my hunting and I moved along the tree line following the foot prints. They were made by a man like biped creature, the stride was longer than mine are, but I could stretch my stride to match the stride. I followed the prints for about another 75 yards they went right through the middle of the saddle between the two mountains.<BR> <BR>At that point I resumed my hunting for deer and dismissed the Bigfoot. The only thing I would add about the prints they were all the same, but I could only see the toes on the first print because that print went slightly into the side of the mound.

    "What was interesting about the tracks that we saw was that when we followed them they stopped at a road. At first thought that would be because someone had made the footprints and then hopped in their car and left. But, on second thought, if someone was making this scene they would want to make sure people were going to see it and would make the tracks much closer to town. Why would someone make fake tracks on the hopes that someone MIGHT see it? When they could make them somewhere that the KNEW people would see it. But anyways, since the tracks did not continue to the other side bigfoot and his kin may have taken the road.",

    " When I was very young I saw a pair of Bigfoot tracks with my father. Im guessing I was about 9 years old. Im now 22. My father and I used to go rabbit hunting all the time. We always went to the same place and always saw dozens and dozens of rabbits. <BR><BR>We would get up very early in the morning, about 1AM, so that we could get out to our spot about an hour before dawn. So it was a few hours outside of Bishop, CA. We would make sure to get there early so that we could sit in the car and wait for dawn to come. <BR><BR>Just as the sun would start to rise and there was enough light to see we would normally see tons of rabbits running about, but that day was different. There was not a single rabbit in sight. That had never happened before. We stayed in the truck and waited until the sun was fully up before we decided to get out and take a stroll around to see if there was anything to see. Just before we left the truck my dad asked me if I wanted to bring the camera and I told him \"Na, we arent going to see anything out here.\" Ha-ha! Boy was I mistaken. <BR><BR>We took off from the truck and went into the wilderness. There was nothing to see at all. No animals anywhere. We were walking along and suddenly we came upon the giant footprints in the sand. There were two sets of prints, one right next to the other. They were barefoot and looked just like human feet. Right away we knew what they were. Its a natural thing that goes through your mind. When you see them you say yourself, \"Those are bigfoot tracks.\" <BR><BR>The first sets of tracks were HUGE, and thee times as big as my fathers feet, and he is about 6'' 3\" with a good sized foot. (He is very thin though). The second set of footprints was the same size as mine. Right next to its parents tracks. The tracks dug deep into the ground and my father and I talked about that. We tried to stomp on the ground to see if we make an indention as deep as theirs but we couldnt, even with our shoes on. <BR><BR>We followed the tracks and we came to a barbwire fence. On the other side was a paved road. On the other side of the road was a hill that went up and overlooked a valley. I was too young to notice anything about how the tracks crossed the fence and got to the road or if there was a piece of fur on the barbs, so Im sorry that I couldnt tell you anymore about that. On the other side of the road there were no tracks and we couldnt find any more around. <BR><BR>My father decided that we needed the camera, so I stayed at the fence while he went back the way we came to get back to the truck. It seemed like it took forever for him to return and being a little kid I was getting a little scared. But, he finally came back and told me that he could not find the truck! So when we were done looking around we took the road that we had found to see where it would lead us. It took us to a small town that we had passed to get to our spot. So we knew where we were form there and were able to finally get back to our truck and once we were there we decided we had gotten enough walking done for the day so we headed home.<BR><BR><BR>",

    " A week ago my family and I went on a vacation to the Double Eagle Resort and Spa in June Lake, California. We stayed at one of the furthest cabins at the resort, which backed up to a forest at the bottom of granite rock formations. These rock formations separated the Inyo National Forest from the town of June Lake. <BR><BR>The first night we stayed at the resort, June 30, 2010, my brother, my father and I were watching TV in the front of the cabin and at around 11:30pm we went out on our deck to look out at the amazing view we had. Within five minutes the silence was broken when we heard a howl in the distance, which sounded like it was coming from the granite formations, which over looked the resort. All of us froze. The sound scared us because we had never heard a sound like that before. The vocalization lasted under a minute. <BR><BR>We waited for another 10-15 minutes out on the deck to see if whatever made the howl would howl again. But it did not howl again so we went back inside and I took a shower. While I was showering my brother and father continued to watch TV, but this time they opened up all the windows in the cabin to see if they could hear the howling again. When I got out of the shower ten minutes later, my brother and father told me they heard the same sound again when I was in the shower and this time my mother who was in bed with her window open heard the howling too. This time there were three howls, which were all shorter than the first howl we heard on the deck and there was only about 20 seconds in between each howl. My family and I stayed there another night but did not hear any more howls.<BR>",

    " I went to Mono Lake with my father early in the morning to capture some long exposure photos of the sunrise. We arrived at the lake around 6 AM right at golden hour. When we got to the parking lol there was one other car parked in the lot. After grabbing my photography gear (camera bag/tripod) we began walking down the path towards the lake. I was looking off to my right hand side and clearly saw something that was all black and bipedal walking parallel with me about 15 yards away. It ducked behind a small tufa as I was watching it walk. I told my dad that I saw something walking on 2 feet and he said that he saw something moving over in that direction as well. <BR><BR>I knew that there was a person in the same area as us since there was a car parked in the lot when we arrived so there was still a possibility that what I saw was a person dressed in all black, although it would be strange for a person to be walking off the path in the area where I saw this thing since we were still away from the lake where all of the points of interest are. <BR><BR>My dad and I continued to walk towards the lake to shoot the sunrise. As we approached the lake there was another photographer who had their camera mounted on their tripod and was taking photos. At this point I realized that what I saw walking was not a person since the owner of the car who was parked when we arrived had just been accounted for. I did not think I would ever experience something like this in my lifetime. I wish I would have gone to the area where I saw it and looked for some evidence or footprints but I was too scared to stray off the path since it was able to disappear in the brush / tufas so easily.",

    " Two years ago, I went with my Uncle to stay at a cabin in Mammoth Lakes to hike, fish, and just enjoy the nature.  We had a cabin right on the border of Lake Mary and he had brought his two sheep dogs with him to the cabin. Every night he and I would take turns taking the dogs out for a walk. We would bring a flash light with us each time we went out to walk the dogs. <BR><BR>One night when I was walking the dogs, one of them started growling and I listened closely and could hear the rustling of fallen leaves and the breaking of small branches. I shined my light right at where I heard the sounds. Now both of the dogs were growling and pulling at the leash trying to get at whatever was in the forest. I looked around closely with the flashlight and then I saw something. A huge figure about 200 feet away from me was watching me and the dogs. It was kind of swaying between the trees and just staring right at me and the dogs. It looked like a very tall ape, but it looked more built like a human. <BR><BR>I was scared stiff and I must have stood there for a minute or two holding the dogs back and staring at the creature when it turned around and started walking away. I then walked very fast back to the cabin watching the woods and not stopping for anything. I have never spoken of this incident with anyone before in my life and I have recently heard about this sight and thought it was finally time to talk about this with someone who would understand.<BR>",

    " I would like to start with my background as a backpacker and hunter.  I go to the Sierra Nevada Mountains about 1 and a half hours outside of Fresno, California.  Last summer around the time of the sighting, I made about 11 trips to numerous places. This is what I do.  I feel I have a good knowledge of the outdoors, and I have becomes quite at home in the wilderness.  <BR><BR>On Friday, July 14, 2006 my friends, Jason and one other person who has asked me to exclude his name from this report, started out on a backpacking trip to Hobler Lake in the John Muir Wilderness. We started off our hike a little late in the day, about 5:00 pm, on the Maxsom trailhead, just on the east side of Courtright Reservoir. <BR><BR>We were hiking for about an hour, this being about 6:00 pm in the day.  It was dusk when we noticed something moving parallel to us in the woods.  It was hard to make out what it was because of the terrain consisting of dense wooded areas with evergreen trees.  It had a reddish brown color, and in the distance you could tell it was much bigger than a person was.  We assumed it was a black bear so we moved on. <BR><BR>Whatever it was seemed quite interested in us.  Every time we stopped, it would stop moving as well.  This continued for about an hour until it got too dark to see clearly without a flashlight.  <BR><BR>We continued hiking to our destination for a while when I started hearing a crackling of branches to my left about 50 feet behind me, maybe less.  When I turned around, I saw a black outline of something looking at me from behind a tree.  I froze for a second because I was in such shock over what I was seeing.  Out of all the animals Ive seen at night in the mountains, this had no resemblance.  It was standing on two legs, was about 7 and one half feet tall, and was 4 feet wide at the shoulders.  It had hardly no neck, and very long arms that hung down by its mid legs.  It also had a fluffy appearance like it had a thick long coat of fur.  <BR><BR>Then I whispered to my friend Jason to shine a flashlight on it.  As I said that, this thing must have heard me, because it turned around and started walking off somewhat fast.  At this time we decided to load our firearms, which werent much because all we had was a 40 caliber pistol and a 22 pistol.  For a time, whatever it was seemed to have left the area.  <BR><BR>We arrived at Hobler Lake around 10:00 pm.  We set up our camp, cooked some food, and rested for a bit.  I finally fell asleep about 11:30 pm, but Jason and my other friend stayed up.  <BR><BR>When I awoke in the morning, Jason told me that he and bob were by the lake having a cigarette when they heard large objects crashing in the water about 100 yards from them.  He described it a like something very large was jumping and thrashing in the water.  <BR><BR>The next day we were staying close to camp because of all that went on.  We walked about away from camp to explore the area when we heard noise from camp like the clinking of pots and stuff.  We ran back to camp to find nothing out of place, but when looked closer some things were slightly moved, but not very far away from where we left them. <BR>",

    " While camping in the Sierra, several members of our group were awakened by  repeated screams very similar to the Klamath and Washington State sound files at bfro.net.  I first  heard the eerie bellowing screams at 4:45AM and they continued until 5:05AM, followed by another short series soon after .  I thought it was over for the night until a short series of screams began at 6:30... from a different direction.  The vocalizations were grouped in a pattern of 4 or 5 \"blasts\" (lung-fulls?) with a (resting?) pause of a few seconds followed by another series of 4 or 5, a pause, and so on.  This continued with only slight variation for 20 straight minutes; then the two other series mentioned above. While my wife says her heart was \"beating like crazy\", I was simply astonished. I''ve been interested in the bigfoot phenomenon for more than 30 years, so I had tears in my eyes as I paid close attention to this almost indescribable sound. To my thinking there are only two possibilities to explain these nocturnal screams: 1) Someone playing high-fidelity recordings at high volume at 4:45AM, or 2) A sasquatch was screaming out  at night in the forests of Calaveras County. Either way -- MANY other campers had to have heard what we did.",

    " As a new High School graduate in 1977, I planned a camping trip to an area near a boy scout camp (Wolfboro) I was familar with, with my new girl friend.  As an Eagle scout and an athelete (I was recruited to play footbal at Cal) I wanted to impress my friend who loved the outdoors.  The destination was around a dammed watershed called Spicers Resevoir.  There was a dirt (logging road) turn off from Hwy 4, between Bear Valley and Angles Camp.  We drove down this windy dirt road (some 7-15 miles), crossing over a little bridge that crossed a very shallow Stanislaus River (since it was very hot during this summer month), until we reached the end of the road at the dam.  We packed about a mile down the river (?Green waters River) that ran out the bottom of the dam. Only one side of the river had a hiking trail. The other side of the river was a very steep and rocky (e.g. boulders) bank.  This was in the middle of the week, and I knew from my scouting and other trips that very few people were seen in this area.  I was setting up my camp at a clearing next to the river and my girlfriend was fishing.  It was hot, as she had a tangled line while wading in the stream. She yelled up to me that she saw somebody crossing the river above us, some distance, from the other side of the river. Effectively to warn me not to be surprised if they walked past on the trail.  Nobody came down the trail and we forgot the incident. An uneventfull evening passed.  The next day we decided to break camp and go back to the Stanislaus (maybe there was better fishing). This obviously required us to pack back to the car and drive a few miles to the little bridge crossing the Stanislaus River. We parked next to the bridge and found what looked like a fishing trail.  We packed along the trail (if you could call it that) until it was too difficult to hike.  There was alot of little pines close together and there was bigger and bigger granite boulders in our way.  We found a clearing, some 20 yards from the river. I pitched the tent next to a dried creek bed.  The creek bed was a few feet wide and the tent was a dozen feet from it.  The rear of the tent was a few feet from a slope consisting of huge boulders and small pines.  We made a camp fire when evening fell.  It was a clear moonlite night except for the thunder we heard in the distance. I remembered that there could be these rouge thunder clouds. Anyway, later in the evening when we were about to \"turn in\" we heard strong screams coming from the upsteam direction. This was in the direction where we ran out of a hiking trail. The screams occured periodically for 1/2 to an hour.  I rationalized them to be a sick or injured \"range\" cow. During my scouting days I was told that cattle roamed the area and the snow level would effectively heard them down the river valley.  We went to bed and must of only been asleep for a couple of hours when the thunder clouds were close enough to wake us.  I wanted to put some things (e.g. shoes) in the tent so they wouldn''t get soaked from the rain.  Once back in my sleeping bag I stayed awake listening, when I heard two foot steps behind us on the rocks of the dried creek bed. I listened more intensley and heard two more step, then a pause. I was really scared, especially since the movie Friday the 13th had been playing. I really thought it was a person stalking us.  I attempted to peer out the back (mesh) window of the tent.  Nothing was said between me and my friend and I didn''t want to alarm her, even though I was scared stiff. What I did see was a large silhouette standing and then moving (the two steps at a time) past a tree in that dried creek bed. After, what seemed like a long time, the thing moved/walked deliberately past our tent twords the river. The front part of the tent faced the river and was zipped closed. But this thing, that I believe was Big Foot, started splashing and making that strong high pitched screaming noise at the river.  I then heard foot steps come directly twords our tent and stop right in front of the tent. My hand was on my buck knife.  Then I heard it run away.  I think, after a while, we might have said something like \"did you hear that?, lets get out of here\". Day break was only a short time off and we waited only for the first sign of light.  We hastily packed up camp and drove home. We talked about maybe checking with the ranger, but we didn''t.  We eventually tied the \"fisherman\" crossing the river the day before, below the dam, to maybe not being a human but a Big Foot.  This so called \"fisherman\" crossing the river was \"dressed\" in very dark clothing, my girlfriend said, that seemed odd since it was so bloody hot.<BR><BR>I haven''t changed my story in 25 years.

    " On 7/3/06 around 4:35pm, I (age 42) took my two sons, ages 7 & 8 to a nearby lake while my husband stayed behind to continue building our cabin. It''s a hard 23 minute, offroad drive of 4.3 miles, so we were very specific about our departure and return times, just in case my husband would need to come looking for us. <BR><BR>After unsuccessfully looking for a wading spot near our truck, (mucky water, underwater plants and drop-offs) the boys and I made quite a trek to a prior favorite point that juts out like a partial island, with fishing nets, swimsuits and snacks. The path has become almost non-existent due to fallen trees, branches and almost no foot traffic. This is a very remote lake, not visible from any main forest service road. Our whole trip consisted of 1 1/3 hours at the lake. <BR><BR>We were dipping our toes and talking about the fish, when I said we needed to pack it up. I had just heard a noise in the far distance of what sounded like a single, medium tone \"whoop or yup\" (#1). I told the boys to be quiet for a minute and this time we all heard it (#2). None of us could identify it, so I yelled, \"Hello?\" and waited. It responded again with a single \"whoop\" (#3) which sounded significantly louder.  The boys caught on to this right away, and said, Mom, its getting closer.  We thought it might be a hurt backpacker off in the distance, so I yelled, \"Is anybody out there?\" Each response was about 30-60 seconds and this time it was very loud and close (#4). <BR><BR>I thought someone was playing a joke on us at first, but realized I could neither see, nor identify the sound. <BR><BR>The frightening issue was that no other sound was made as it approached us. I expected sticks and twigs to be snapping, so I wrote it off as some curious bird moving quickly between trees (mostly for the boys sake).  There was a golden mantel chipmunk in the distance that was very upset about something, but everything else was eerily quiet. I felt like we were being watched the whole time, but never said anything because I didn''t want to spook the boys.  I experienced the same \"watched\" feeling the last time we were at that spot (last year) and remember hearing what I thought was a deer walking around us, but I never saw anything.<BR><BR>We packed up fast and bee-lined it to the pickup. I did not want to be stuck on a spit of land with two young kids that are just learning to swim. I could have made it across the lake to the truck, but not the boys. <BR><BR>It sounded like a cross between a human and animal that was made by something very large. It was absolutely not a bird (quail/woodpecker), bear or cougar sound. Last year on two separate occasions, we had a young cougar, then a bear run in front of our pickup and we''re very familiar with their \"walking and verbal\"  sounds. I have been camping all of my life and have never experienced that sound before. I had my digital camera with me and never once thought to put it in Video mode to record the sounds. The whole thing took place over a 5 minute period and we were just focusing on getting back to the pickup. <BR><BR>I was born and raised in Port Orchard, WA, so I''m very familiar with Sasquatch and BigFoot tales. I have always felt they could be real, but have never had any encounter with one. I decided to poke around online to see what a Yeti might sound like and read John Bindernagel''s research. My hair stood on end and I called my husband at work who thinks the whole thing is fabulous. I also read about the BFRO expeditions in Northern California and Humboldt County, along with a lot of other information and projects. <BR><BR>I decided to respond to you with my information for whatever its worth.  I cant explain it, and both of the boys have very vivid and accurate memories of what we all heard. Thanks for listening and please contact us if you have any questions.  <BR><BR>",

    " Okay, I just spent about ten or fifteen minutes listening to the various sounds and recordings that you have to try to help me identify what we heard. I cannot say that any of the recordings sounded just like what we heard, however it sounded similar to many of them. <BR><BR>My family (husband and two kids) went up to Big Prather Meadows, straight up from Dorrington, California. My husband''s grandpa has a small cabin in the meadow, and we go there when we can, generally in the summer. I made the mistake of reading a bunch of your stuff prior to the trip, and I admit that I was on \"high alert\" that first night. However, around 2:30 or so in the morning of Friday, July 25th, 2008 (just three days ago), I heard some kind of vocalization that was not familiar to me.<BR><BR>I was not happy to hear this, honestly. I suppose I ought to be since I have held an avid interest in this subject for years, but there is a whacking big difference between sitting safely in your home reading about this stuff on the net, and listening to something make funky noises in the dark woods of a forest. As my best friend said, \"I used to really like the cabin...\" I got out of the tent to wake up my husband, who was sleeping on the ground by the unused fire pit. We both sat and listened to the sounds for about an hour and a half, or so. <BR><BR>To the best of my ability, this is what we heard:<BR>Loud, clear, not-shrill sounding (to me, the Puyallup calls sound somewhat metallic and shrill), medium-range, and smooth sounds. They began lower in pitch and would rise smoothly to end at a higher pitch, but not like the whoops that you have recorded. These didn''t have that \"lilt\" at the end. It was just a smooth ascent from low range up to a higher range. <BR><BR>There was another call that sounded like what a contraction looks like. (Forgive me, I''m not sure how to describe it but it made me think of what my contractions looked like on paper when birthing my kids), beginning low, smoothly rising up to a higher level, and then smoothly descending down again. <BR><BR>There was also a kind of a hiccup sort of sound that would directly follow some of the calls, but I was literally shaking and too freaked out about it to really pay attention to what kind of call it followed: the upswing, or the contraction call. <BR><BR>Anyhow, as I said, this went on for over an hour with the two of us listening. Sometimes it would sound like it was moving near to us. Other times it sounded further away. I am not sure if there were two animals, thus accounting for the near/far sounds, or one. If it was two animals, they sounded identical to me.<BR><BR>After this happened, we both tried to explain how big/far the sounds were to us. We both agree that it sounded somewhat distant, but find it hard to tell since sound might carry really well in a dead-silent forest. We agree that it sounded to be between a half a mile and a mile away. We also agree that it was a large sound. Whatever made it sounded effortless on its part, but was a very large sound. We believe that it is a sound of \"size\" similar to, say a very loud moo of a cow across a field. I''m digging here because I''ve never had any experience like it so I don''t have much I can truly compare it to.<BR><BR>I grew up in Washington State, west side. I''m a Biology minor with a Life Science teaching credential, so I am familiar, at least, with what wildlife looks like and sounds like in videos, if not in person. But most of my personal encounters with wildlife have been animals of the smaller variety: coyote yips and howls things like that. I''ve only heard larger animals on wildlife programs and I am holding out the hope that one of your specialists will call me back and explain that what we heard was just a \"such and such\" and often is confused with a Big Foot call. I''d be able to enjoy the cabin a lot more if you could do so. But, I know you won''t, because this was a very strange sound, and even my mathematician-husband, who is grounded in science and wasn''t afraid like I was, stated that it sure was loud, and that it wasn''t like anything he''d ever heard before. It sounded like an animal, but it also sounded enough like a person to think it could have been a joke, but not exactly. I do not think I could replicate the sound. <BR>",

The sound report happened in 1981 in the Carson-Iceberg Wilderness.  Starting at about 11:00 pm and ending at dawn, a whole series of howls began and continued every night for three nights.  The howls would start after two men with dogs started out into the forest after dark.  The howls were very deep, unlike anything witness has heard before.  The sounds would circle around a ridge and then end up where it started near their camp. They had a dobberman dog who was very afraid of the sound, and this is what alarmed the witness about the whole experience.  Witness has heard many bobcats and mountain lions, and this wasn''t even similar. Sounded to him like the howls on the BFRO website.<BR>Footprints were seen in summer of 1984 near Beartrap Cabin in the Mt. Reba area of Calaveras County. ",

    " I used to live in Bishop, CA on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada mountains.  I have spent lots of time camping, hiking, fishing, and skiing in the Sierra backcountry.  I am familiar with many kinds of animal sounds and signs in the mountains.<BR><BR>Last weekend, we were camping at the Sawmill Walk-in Campground on the east side of Yosemite National Park.  After sunset as dusk was deepening, we were sitting around our camp table talking.  From the direction of the forests that line the canyon floor towards Mt. Conness in the west, a series of whoop-howls rang out from the distance and rolled down the canyon.  My sister was talking and immediately stopped, turned around, and said, \"What is that?!\"  The calls continued for a few moments and then ceased.  They sounded most similar to the Snohomish and Puyallup calls on the BFRO website.  When the calls started, all other normal background wildlife noise stopped and didn''t resume until several seconds after the calls ceased.  There were no answers to the original call, nor did it repeat.<BR><BR>That area of Yosemite is relatively deserted, and the Sawmill Walk-in Campground only has a few sites that are scattered widely.  The trail that runs through the campground eventually leads to the top of Mt. Conness and branches into the back country.  I have never had an experience like this before, but hope I one day have the opportunity to have a visual encounter with one of these animals.",

I had just woken up from a loud strange sound, I put my boots on and got out of the tent and heard a very loud howling noise comign from the top of the cliffs nearby. It was just a really loud howling sound almost like the sound a gorilla makes. But it lasted for about two hours. From 5am when the sun was just coming up til just before i ate breakfast, and that was around 7am. But during the course of this loud howling sound, what ever it had moved.. along the cliffs, I didn''t see anything but I could tell the sound wasn''t coming from where it was originally. The howling was echoing off the canyon walls, and it could be heard throughout the canyon, boy scouts had left very early that morning after they heard the sounds. There were many caves in the cliffs, the top of the cliff was about probably 8,000 ft, I was around 7,400 ft. What ever had been making the sounds I heard that morning eventually stopped and left the area I think, or I just didn''t hear anything after that. ",

    " I took a trip over the fourth of July to visit a friend in Modesto.  We traveled to Tuolumne County, past Sonora, and camped off of Gargoyle trail above Strawberry on the night of July 4th.  We got to the camp site at about 4:00pm and set up.  My two friends took a nap after setting the tent up but I decided to look around, so I took a hike down a dirt road that lead into the forest.  I was hiking around when my friend came to look for me.  We hiked further into the forest and found a big rock formation and climbed up.  The top was about the size of a football field.  On top we found three stacked rocks and took some video of it.  The bottom rock was big, it came up to my shins and the top two were smaller. Maybe five pounds each.  <BR>We then went off into the unknown on the other side of the rock formation.  We had to hike down a lot of boulders and the brush was getting pretty thick.  It was now probably 7:00 or 7:30 so the sun was disappearing and it was getting dark.  As we got closer to the trees I felt as though we were being watched.  Just my imagination I thought, so we hiked on.  This feeling remained and I started to think about how long it would take to get up the rocks we were clibing down. Besides if something was watching us it could have been a bear.  I convinced my friend to go back to camp and we did. At about 8:30 or 9:00 my friend heard rocks being clinked together of in the distance and he said they were answered off in the opposite direction.  I didn''t believe him but soon I heard the clinking too.  It was fast but obviously not a wood pecker.  My friend commented that the pattern seemed not human, but I thought it could have been. This banging went on for about twenty minutes and then quit.  We went to sleep later and didn''t hear anything all night.  I did notice it was a moonless night and the forest was pitch black.  The next morning we got up and I checked for foot prints around the camp fire were I cleared everything within five feet but saw nothing.  As we were packing up we heard the banging off in the distance again so I decided to try and copy the patterns.  I tried using two rocks and the sound wouldn''t carry.  So I then tried a rock on a log.  Finally I settled on a small branch on the log because it sounded to me like what was coming from the forest.  The banging was repititious with a pattern on the end.  I mimiced the banging for about ten minutes before it stopped answering me.  I started packing up again and we heard it another time so I tried to answer it.  No answer.  It did it again, I answered, no answer.  There were long pauses in between my responces and its banging.  I got the feeling what ever it was, wanted to continue it''s banging but not in response to me.  We finished packing up and left.",

    "      My girlfriend and I were finishing a week long backpack trip south of Sonora pass and we spent our last night on a ridge line seperating two deep canyons.  To the east was Kennedy canyon which we had hiked up that day, to the west was another canyon of which I don''t know the given name, only that it was very deep and rugged.  <BR><BR>     I was a bit concerned about our campsite due to the lack of decent trees to hang our food in (this was before bear cannisters, and packers still hung their food in trees to keep it away from bears), they were all very small due to our elevation.  I awoke about 1 a.m. to the sound of rockfall off one of the peaks above us and I sat awake because I thought it was possibly the sound of a bear coming up the nearby creekbed.<BR><BR>     Quite suddenly the sound of what I assumed was a large gust of wind came barrelling up the western canyon.  This immedietly struck me as odd as the night was very still.  The sound started as a low moan, growing in strength and intensity and eventually raised in pitch until it resembled a scream bouncing off the mountain walls.  This episode lasted approx. a minute.  As best as I can put the sound into print it went something like this: WHOOOOOOOORROOOOUUUUUIIIIIIEEEEEEEE.<BR>I have spent a good part of my life knocking about the wilderness and many years as an alpine mountaineer.  Now I have sat through many a lonley night on a mountain ledge waiting for first light with nothing to do but listen to the wind howl  around the peaks and I''ve heard it do some pretty strange stuff, but when I heard this noise I was dumbfounded.  Now I was wide awake and all was still again.  No wind whatsoever.  After several minutes the sound began again, building up the canyon until it reached the same screaming crescendo.  I thought \"whoa, that was bizarre\".<BR><BR>     Satisfied that our food stash wasn''t being raided by a bear I tried to go back to sleep when a very similar moan/howl/scream came up from Kennedy canyon to the east.  The sound was similar in tone and building pitch but seemed fainter, possibly originating from a more distant point.  This is when my girlfriend awoke and I asked her what she thought of the sound, but she wasn''t much of a wilderness person and I didn''t want to scare her so I didn''t push it.",

Johnson estimates the size as 10 feet tall, four feet across the shoulders and as much as 750 pounds. Tracks were found that were 22 inches in length and had a five-foot stride.  The entire experience is accounted in \"Bigfoot\", by Ann Slade and Alan Berry, 1976, Bantam Books.",

    " Today, August 23, 2007, I was hiking off-trail in El Dorado County, California in the forest 60 feet north of the Bryan Meadow trail, when at about 10:30 a.m. I saw a tall dark figure peering around a large red fir stump. This was from perhaps 100 feet away, I quickly walked up to the stump, but there was no one there. It would have been possible to move uphill away from me using the large stump as cover, but only a very athletic person could have managed this in the time available.<BR><BR>Moving then uphill and to the SE, I regained the Bryan Meadow trail and there noted a large footprint, which I photographed next to my two-way radio. It is about twice the length of my foot, (a size 12 boot size). I do not know the source of this print, but it was where the rapid retreat occurred.<BR><BR>I had just parked at the Sierra Ski area (Short Stuff run), and begun walking up the forest north of the trail to Bryan Meadows. I was moving quietly and slowly, crossing from the north side of the stream to the south without being on any trail. Another biologist was still moving up the canyon on the north side of the stream, but was well ahead of my position.<BR><BR>It could have been a human, but the person would have to have been wearing all uniformly dark clothing and had a dark complexion or been wearing dark paint. Head to knee, the figure was a uniformly dark hue and no other detail was discernable, except that the shoulders were slightly more narrow than the average person would be, and the height was at least 6''-3\" to 6''-5\". The figure was peering at me from the west end of the stump, leaning forward, so that all above the knee was visible. The figure was of a uniformly dark color, perhaps black.",

    " It was in the summer of 1986 when myself, my friend and his brother set off to climb Bennett Peak in Santa Rosa. Back then there was only a golf course separating the rural area from Annadel State Park. The way we climbed took us over a series of smaller hills before we got to the base of the peak. On our descent off the last hill we took a break knowing the large climb ahead of us. Just then we heard the loud snapping and cracking of tree limbs directly across the valley that separated ourselves from Bennett Peak. It was then I spied a huge brown/black hairy back trucking up the peak at a very fast pace. As this creature moved up the hill it basically was clearing all of the foliage, mainly oak tree branches, out of its way. When we reached the spot where we saw this thing, we noticed that the tree branches that were damaged were four to five feet off the ground. Bear? Maybe but we don''t get much bear in Santa Rosa.",

Chris came running into the back door of the house and called me, we ran out to the back yard and listened. Chris heard what he thought was a loose cow across the Noyo River. As we listened we heard a creature moving through the forest making very loud crashing sounds. The creature stopped; it was silent for a moment perhaps it saw us watching. Then we heard a grunting sound which became a very low frequency but loud moo, like a cow but deeper in pitch and  much more intense. The creature''s yell went from a \"moo\" sound to a very high pitch scream unlike any sound I ever heard before or ever will again. After the creature yelled it took off again through the forest heading inland it took only a few seconds and it was to far away to hear the foot steps anymore. <BR>This animal sounded like no other and moved fast.<BR>Even a cow running through the forest could not make the sounds we heard or cover the same distance as quickly.<BR>It was a Big Foot.",

    " Well I have collected enough information from various bigfoot sites about screams to conclude that I heard a sasquatch on a bicycle touring trip from Portland, OR to Santa Barbara, CA in the summer of 1981. My girlfriend & I arrived at Fort Ross Historical Park north of Jenner, CA in Sonoma County on an evening in early July. We decided to camp there at Fort Ross as it was marked as a campsite on our map, but it had no campsites. There was no one at the main house nor around the fort (Old Russian Fur Trading Fort) or on any part of the grounds. We rode to a campground further south but it was too expensive & we decided to ride back to Fort Ross. We camped to the left of the upper parking lot under some monterey pines next to a picnic bench. We ate dinner & went to bed at around 9 p.m. <BR><BR>At approximately 1 a.m., we heard a scream 20 feet to the left of the tent (our heads were facing the ocean).  It was a blood curdling scream of various sounds in succession that lasted at least 9 seconds. It frightned me to my bone marrow. I froze in fear knowing that whatever made the sound was huge. It was so close I could hear the timbre in its throat. Since I''m a musician I realize how much force it takes to make a sound that loud. I''ve also been camping all my life, & have heard various animals but this was different.<BR><BR>Anyway, my girlfriend said in a whisper \"What the [edit] was that!\" I started to reach for a flashlight and her hand grabbed my wrist with a vice-like pressure so I didn''t move. We remained frozen listening to every little noise for an hour. Incedently there were sheep running free everywhere going baah baah & they didn''t stop making noise when the scream occured. Finally my girlfriend fell asleep & I remained on guard with my hands hovering around the tent pole to use as a weapon, thinking that at any moment it would stick its fanged head into our tent. At around 2:30am (I guess) I heard another scream down by the fort in the lower parking area. I figured it wasn''t coming back so I fell asleep. It didn''t occur to me the next morning that it was a sasquatch so I didn''t look for footprints. Nor did I hear it walking the night before.",

    " Hiking the Seven Sisters Trail from Mt Holyoke to the Notch in the Hadley / Amherst area of Massachusetts. My hiking partner and I got to Taylor''s Notch and could hear the wind ripping through making eerie noises. We both heard a lot of whistling  and breaking branches which I initially attributed to the wind going through the rocky ledges of Taylor''s Notch. We hiked over one large hill and the wind was lessening but we realized the whistling was closer and then there were whooping noises and calls along with the whistles. The calls were going back and forth and I realized we were surrounded. We kept talking loudly hoping to scare off any animals and kept my bear spray in hand for the next mile or so. Not sure what it was but highly unusual and did not sound like a grown or baby bear,canine, coyote, mountain lion, or fox. I frequently hike and spend time outdoors. I am at a loss as to what was with us that day. I am going back soon to see if I can find more.",

    " Hello!<BR><BR>This is something that happened a long time ago and to be honest I never thought it could be connected to Sasquatch/Bigfoot but recently Ive been reading about the topic a lot and I figured Id send it to you guys after finding your site and just checking out reports from areas where Ive lived in the past. Anyway, I found a report from Belchertown, MA and I lived a rural part of Belchertown for several years when I was in college. <BR><BR>This was sometime around 1997-1998 in Belchertown. My housemates and I were out on our porch which faced a 2-3 acre meadow. This open meadow and the porch were on the east side of the house. The entire area past the meadow to the East was wooded with houses and cabins here and there for about a mile until you hit a lake. Behind the house was abput 10-20 yards of woods with a walking trail and then another 10 yards past was a train tracks running East/west then more woods. <BR><BR>Anyway, my housemates and I were out on the porch when we heard the sound of a tree crashing to the ground.  About 19 seconds later while we all were kindve shocked there was an enormously loud and guttural growl/scream/roar.  In all my life I have never heard any animal sound that could match it in intensity, volume, and it just sounded plain angry and vivacious. It is hard to describe just how loud it was and how stunned we all were that this was coming from an animal just inside the tree line.  There were coyotes, owls, foxes galore back there and the sounds they made were a world away in comparison.  <BR><BR>We all immediately looked at each other, got up and went into the house as fast as we could without saying a word. <BR><BR>Everyone assumed it was an animal but after reading about and hearing recordings of presumed Sasquatch scream and howls it brought the memory rushing back because it is so similar to what we heard. <BR><BR>Anyway, just wanted to send this in as I saw there was another report for this area. <BR><BR>Best regards ",
    :environment
    "The property was about 7 acres. Most of it a meadow but wooded in front of the street with a small creek near the road. Woods surrounded the entire property and behind the house there was a public trail and a train track running parallel East/west behind the house. To the east of the 2-3 acre was a wooded area filled with many large Birch trees. The houses in this area are mostly in the woods.",

    " I parked up the road a ways so any cops or ranger patrols didn''t see my car. It was 1am with a 3/4 moon. The water was very low this day. I was fishing and there was about 4 Beaver-Tail slaps on the water so I knew there would''nt be any smallies hanging around. I took a few more casts and caught a Dace. Its like a sucker with the body of a trout. Very silver in color and unedible. I was trying to get the fish off my hooks when I heard something heavy about 45 yrds away from me cracking sticks as it approached from the road onto the freshly cut brush (from the work they did around there, days prior).<BR><BR>It sounded like a human walking, and I thought I was in trouble with the law. My flashlight was dying and I was having trouble seeing just getting the fish off my 2 treble hooks. <BR><BR>I asked, \"Who''s There?!?!\" and I just heard a stick snap really loud as it stood still. I hit my flashlight in order to make it brighter and I seen big eyeshine and a dark sillouette of what looked to be shoulders. I started yelling at it to get out of here and at this point, I''m thinking deer... or worse, maybe a bear standing up. I heard a few more big snaps as it walked onto the paved road and that''s when it cried out in this terrible noise that I''ve never heard before. It echoed thru the mountains and it scared the bajesus out of me.<BR>It wasn''t a bear, or a deer, that''s for sure. It was huge, and the sound it made sounded like a shrieking demon baby. That''s the only way I could describe it. A loud shrieking howl. It wasn''t a roar or a deep growl. It was more high pitched.<BR><BR>I cut my line with the lure still in the fishes mouth and kicked the fish half hazardly into the water and ran as fast as I could to my car which was the scariest run/walk/stop & listen journey to my car I''ve ever encountered in my life. I was waiting for a werewolf to jump out and get me or something. True terror that I''ve never experienced to this day.",

    " Westfield , MA 3am<BR>Couldn''t sleep and went outside to have a cigarette. Heard howls in the distance that I never heard before. I''ve worked as a wilderness counselor for the past 10 years and heard all sorts of animal noises in the night foxes, coyotes, owls etc.. This sound had a lack of clarity but power in its voice. I knew that it came from a long distance away. I remember listening to Bigfoot calls years back and on a hunch ran inside found the EXACT same howls on the net sounded like the Snohomish, WA 1978-79 calls. I woke up my friend who has been hunting western mass for 30 years and he said he never heard anything like it. He heard it and he said it gave him the chills. The howls trailed off as if he creature was moving. Incident lasted for about 10 minutes. I google mapped the area the sound came from and its a huge swath of wilderness that stretches into Vermont and south into Connecticut. ",

    " First of all, I feel the need to preface this report with some background information. I have been in the process of writing a book on Ape Cave near Mt St Helens. I contacted Jeff Lemley about getting some reports about Bigfoot stories to add to my book. I have kept in close contact with Jeff since the first contact and emailed him immediately after we got back from our trip.<BR><BR>I told my husband, Larry, that I wanted to go camping at Peterson Prairie for my birthday (August 15th) with my twin sister, Vicki and her husband, Jim K. I thought it would be fun to take in a cave or two, time permitting. My husband and I are avid cavers and enjoy spending free time exploring the wild caves of Southern Washington State near Mt St Helens and Mt Adams. We both felt it would be a good time to introduce my sister and her husband (and their toy red Poodle, Sparky) to the sport of wild caving.<BR><BR>The four of us drove our two minivans through the Dark Divide and arrived at camp late in the day on the 14th. Our favorite camp spot was still available so we proceeded to set up camp. As it turned out, my sister and her husband, took the safe way out and set up camp in their Dodge Caravan, while I pitched our miniscule backpacking tent 50 feet South of the camp in a small clearing surrounding by small pines. It was just enough room to pitch a small tent and still be able to tie off the guy ropes to keep the rainfly away from the tent.<BR><BR>As far as I knew, the night was uneventful until my husband spoke up the next morning. Larry told all of us that he thought he heard a Bigfoot howling (my husband is an extreme skeptic when it comes to anything related to Bigfoot). We all talked about it for a while and then decided to get ready to go caving in Cheese Cave, a local lava tube. Later in the day, we rode our bikes to some local caves and then went back to camp. Later, Larry and I left my sister and her husband at camp to rest while we set out to find Dynamite Cave. We drove around all of the dirt roads in the STR that we thought it was supposed to be located in. We parked the van at several locations. At one spot, my husband started walking down a remote trail with me following a short distance behind him. I stopped on the trail not far from the car because I heard something very large run through the bush to my right, just off the trail. My husband kept going, but I was too apprehensive to move. Whatever it was, it was huge; but it didn''t sound like an elk moving through the bush. Also, I felt like something was watching me. It was quite creepy! Since Larry had moved out of sight, I felt very vunerable and literally ran up to catch up with him. I kept telling him I wanted to go back to the car; but didn''t want to go by the one spot alone. He finally relented and we walking briskly to the car.<BR><BR>That night we all walked to the clearing due East of camp, next to the road which led to the group camp to watch the stars and anything else interesting in the clear skies. After turning in about 10PM, we slept soundly until about 3AM, when I was awakened by an incredibly loud howling, unlike anything I had ever heard in my life. Since I am an avid outdoorsperson, I have camped out and seen and heard most of the wild things that occur in the forests and mountains. This was like nothing I had ever heard before. There was absolutely no other sounds from the forest until a Barred Owl responded to the howl. <BR><BR>I woke Larry up to ask him about the howls. He said that it was the very same thing that he heard the night before. We both listened to it banter back and forth with the owl. After maybe 10 to 15 minutes of howling, the owl took off flying North through the trees. We could both hear his wings flapping as he was hooting. He was much closer to us than the thing which was howling; but the howling was much louder than the owl. <BR><BR>What happened next sent chills down my spine. I was laying on my stomach in the tent, needing very much to go outside and relieve myself; but unwilling to venture outside due to the howlings I was still listening to. Larry had fallen back asleep, so unfortunately, the thing I heard next fell on my ears alone. The best I could describe it was a howling turning into an Ape-like chattering. It sounded like someone was practicing phonics by contorting their mouth, while at the same time, reciting all the vowels. That is the best I can describe it. The sounds were incredibly loud and quite frightening sounding. I lay motionless until the sounds died down and I fell asleep.<BR><BR>I was awakened one more time around 6:15 to 6:30 in the morning. Light was already finding its way into camp which I could see through the mosquito netting at the head of our tent. This time I heard a pack of coyotes start up, followed again by that same howling sound. At this point, I was really getting freaked out; but was still not willing to venture out of the tent. As soon as it was light enough, I got up and ran to my sister''s van. I rapped on their window and asked if they heard the howls. Of course, they hadn''t heard anything; but were quite interested in what Larry and I had heard that night.<BR><BR>When I got home, I emailed Jeff Lemley to see if he had any wave files to listen to that might sound like what we heard. I listened to every owl sound on the web and nothing sounded like what we heard. A few days later, I got an email from Jeff about the other report four days before ours, only 6 miles North of us. As I told Jeff, both my husband and I would like to think that the sounds we heard were in fact, Barred Owls. Anyone sleeping in a flimsy nylon tent would probably convince themselves of the same. But then again...",

    " I am reporting this incident from 1991 because I heard of your group on the radio on the way home from work tonight, and you sound credible.<BR><BR>I served as a US Army Infantry Sergeant at Ft.Lewis Wa. for several years, I am also an alpine climber. I went to Mt Adams most of the time because it was much more private than other mountains ie: St Helens, Rainer -- to many people. I also loved the thousands of acres of wilderness area which was restricted to six or eight hearts per group and no vehicles.<BR><BR>Another Sergeant named Jim Avila, my climbing partner, and good friend, and his Golden Retriever pup were there also.<BR><BR>We were only camping and hiking around this trip, since we had the puppy with us, normally we would have camped on a snowfield above the tree line.<BR><BR>Just after nightfall we were talking and the puppy was next to the fire. The sky was crystal clear and everything \"felt\" normal. Since I spent six months out of the year living in the woods, and deserts of the western US and Europe, in the Army, the night is my ally--- I am an expert at what normal feels like.<BR><BR>I needed to urinate, so I stood up and walked to my right rear about 20 feet where a path led down to a stream, I could hear and see the slow moving shallow water in this shallow pea gravel bedded creek, I did my thing and returned to the fire.<BR><BR>We then decided to have some fun and see if we could get a coyote to howl, although we were not sure if any may have been around. We started our best howls to no avail. We continued for about five min. and then stopped. About and hour passed since my previous trip to urinate and I figured I would go again before getting in the sleeping bag.<BR><BR>Jim was across from the fire and could see my walking toward the spot overlooking the path to the creek where I intended to void my bladder, HA HA. <BR><BR>As my feet stopped I could hear footsteps in the dry gravel on the other side of the creek bed about 20'' away. When It heard me stop, it stopped a little to late and I heard it. I felt intelligence in it''s movement, not instinct, it knew it had been busted and just froze. I froze and drew my pistol Jim saw this and at the same time said the puppy flew into the cab of the truck. <BR><BR>Jim, also sensing something wrong, drew his pistol, and stood up. I was looking right where this guy was standing but could not see him because he was across the water but still in front of the opposite bank, he was still frozen like a ROCK. Jim came to back me up he did not know what in the hell was going on and instead of telling him to stop I just kept my eyes glued to the spot I knew the guy was at and he finally decided to move out.He took two strides up the bank away from me with a look over his right shoulder as he was moving away to the right.<BR><BR>His look was concern mixed with a child like fear, as if he really wanted to introduce himself in some way to our \"wolf-calling group\", Also puzzled like \"why are you indiots calling coyotes?----Your Humans, Stupid!\". The most animal like trait was a sort of a very brief mock anger face, which looked like an after-thought just before the big guy went into the woods. <BR><BR>I looked at Jim --- no words --- we threw most of our stuff in the truck and left in a big hurry. There was no way I was staying in those woods that night.<BR><BR>The big guy was huge, but slender as I recall. Don''t ask me how, but I know he was an adolesent. He was sort of like a big kid, but moved like the wind. He saw my eyes and I saw his. I did not tell Jim what I saw, I never did. I never had to.<BR><BR>Please belive me, I swear this account to be true.<BR>Thank You, and God''s Speed in your search.<BR>",

While solo camping at the shelter I decided to call a big foot in. Or try, it was a erie evening, i went to get water it was a long way down. While I had a feeling something was watching me. It was getting dark...uneventfully I hiked back. I made a big fire that lasted for three hours, made alot of noise. Did a couple Bigfoot calls. A whoop whoop type. A wood knock ( no return ). A local plane saw my smoke and buzzed right over my camp site. After a great meal, some singing, i went to bed on the TOP bunk. I always sleep with one eye and ear open. At 2:30am I heard a solid Wood Knock followed immediatley by a tree gettintg pushed over. It did not crash . It sounded dead and not tall... \" Wood Knock then a Thud \", after that nothing. 1/2 hour later I was back to sleep.",

    " My wife and I started to make our descent from the summit of Mount Greylock during a morning hike.  Approximately half a mile on the Cheshire Harbor Trail, close to Rockwell Rd, my wife and I heard a clapping sound.  We stood in place for a few moments, listening to the sound.  The \"clapping\" was non-rhythmic, sometimes there was one or two, other times there were many \"claps\".  In between the \"claps\" there was sounds of something walking, breaking fallen branches as it moved.  The sounds were about a distance of 100 feet from our position on the trail, within a thicker patch of woods.  We listened for almost a full minute and then decided to continue on the trail, moving closer to the source of the sound.  When we reached the area where we believed the clapping sound to be coming from we listened again and heard nothing and had seen no movement.  Further down the trail I attempted figure out the sound.  I did some tree knocking and banged rocks together, but only when I clapped my hands did it most closely match the sound my wife and I had heard.  It was a sound that I have never heard before and it has sparked my interest into figuring out what animal made this noise.",

    " Approx. summer of 2000, I was on Negus Mountain in Rowe, MA (Franklin County) with my wife, sitting on the tailgate...we heard something in the woods, about 100 yards away, walking towards us.  As it got closer, it started to walk faster.  As a life long hunter, I at first told her not to worry, it''s a squirrel or something.  As this creature got closer, my ears and experience told me that this was a biped, only 2 feet crunching through the leaves.  My wife was so freaked out that we had to leave immediately before I could investigate more.<BR><BR>Fast Forward to 2006, I was driving to work one night for the 2300 job in East Deerfield, MA.  I remember I was running a little late, so I was probably speeding, and the time would have been 2230ish.  It was raining lightly.  In West Charlemont, at the end of so-called Tea Street Extension, there is a bridge that carries the road over the railroad tracks. This is about 2-3 miles (the way the bird flies) from the encounter above.  What I saw was something standing perfectly still behind the guardrail.  It was about 6, maybe 6 and a half feet tall, had long brown hair all over it''s body, and was stock still.  I drive this route almost daily (or nightly, in my case) for over 12 years, I know what belongs and what doesn''t.  This did not belong.  I turned around and went back, and it was gone.  Being late for work, I turned around again and went to work.  I have never had any doubt that I saw a Sasquatch.  I haven''t reported it because I don''t want people to think I am a crackpot.  I just recently told my father about it, who told me to look into any organizations such as yours.",

    " A friend and I had been on Black creek in Clay county for a few hours bass fishing with absolutely no luck.  Working the last stretch of bank before we called it a day when I heard something walking in the woods.  I could hear large footsteps and something that sounded like it was scooping water or slapping water, I really can''t describe the sound.  <BR><BR>Now I know this particular area and the wildlife that inhabits it pretty well I think, It is full of deer, wild boar, turkeys, a few black bears, and the rest of the small woodland critters.  And this sound was way too large to be any of them.  <BR><BR>Back to my story, after we heard the noise I motioned to my friend to be silent so I could trolling motor over to the bank so I could try to get a look.  As we were silently getting closer it seemed like the creature must have noticed us because we stuck out like a sore thumb against the back drop of the creek, while it stayed perfectly camoflauged in the wood.  We sat there for a few moments hoping it would move and reveal itself to us which it never did.  <BR><BR>So, as the sun was dropping we had to get back to the boat ramp, we quitely circled away from the shore.  Just as we got away from the tree line something landed in the water about 50 or so feet from the boat. It was a loud splash like a rock or heavy object was thrown because it hit about 15 feet from shore.  Both startled we put out life jackets on and got ready to leave when we heard the footstep start back up, and they sounded as if they were running away at a brisk pace and it sounded like it was a long stride. <BR><BR>Jokingly we said we had just encountered a sasquatch just like every other time I heard something unusual on that body of water.  But as we made our way back to the dock I noticed we were within half a mile from powerlines.  And were within a mile of the county dump that I know for a fact is a popular spot with the local whitetail deer population.  ",

    " I''d like to make a report, however it was years ago but I remember every part pretty well.<BR><BR>I told a few folks about this over the years and they think I was nuts. But doesn''t matter what they think. I was close enough to know what it was. I would say about less than 50 ft. Right in the middle of a fire road.<BR><BR>In December 1977, my dad, uncle and my dad''s other friends and myself went up to the cabin owned by a hunters club in Gardner, Mass. We went to spend the night, cook food and my dad and his friends like to play cards after eating supper. Myself and a friend used the snowmobile with a sled attached to the back, we took turns driving the ski doo around and the other would stand on the foot rest on the sled.<BR><BR>The area was in northern central Massachusetts, very close to New Hampshire boarder. The cabin is in Ashburnham Mass. It''s about 2.5 miles up a fire road called Old Colony Road. I remember it was a snowy winter that year. The area where we saw this thing was right on the edge of a swamp, old train tracks run right thru the area and crosses the fire road that we used to get to the cabin.<BR><BR>It was about 4 p.m. or so, it was just getting a little dark. My friend and I left the cabin with the snowmobile, he was driving first and I was on the foot rest on the sled. We left and came up to the swamp, crossed over the tracks and headed down the road about 50 ft or so. It was getting a little late and we decided to not go to far so we turned the sled around on the road. Had to pick it up because of the narrowness of the road. Once we turned it around it was my turn to drive. So now were facing the tracks and the swamp is on both sides of the road. the road goes right thru the swamp and the tracks cross right by the edge of the swamp.<BR><BR>At this point I looked behind me to see if my friend was on the sled and holding on, when I looked up I saw this creature walking on 2 legs like a human. He crossed right by the tracks at the edge of the swamp and crossed the road right in front of us. I remember it looking at us and I remember the arms swing clearly. Just like the pictures I have seen from your site. Very similar. Anyway, I remember the its size, that''s what was scarey, so large, I''d say about 7to 9 ft high, weight about 400 to 500 pounds. At least for something that size it would most likely be heavy. I know the woods there well. I''ve spent years in the military and hunt every year. I have been trained in tracking and survival in the woods so I know what I am saying and what I saw. But the thing took about 2 steps and he was across the road. All black hair, didn''t notice any smells, but I can tell you this. I won''t forget that day ever. It was cold anyway and with no breeze the smell of it wouldn''t travel far. My friend was shocked. He won''t even mention it when I see him these days. He told one person and they treated him like he was on drugs. So thats why I never wanted to tell to many people.<BR><BR>I wanted to say something about it now because I just say a program on TV the other night about bigfoot and the Kiamichi Mountians, I think in Oklahoma or somewhere out there.<BR><BR>I remember one other thing that might be relevant. That being noises I have been hearing over the years in the woods there. Something like a crying sound but so load it almost seemed as if it were close by. I think it was a ways away because when we heard the sounds it was late, about midnight. We sit by the fireplace outside the cabin sometimes late cooking steak or deer meat on the grill. Behind the cabin is a huge swamp area that goes up to Route 12 in Ashburnham, Mass. The swamp is down a bit behind the cabin. We find moose droppings back there and lots of tree scraps from deer.<BR><BR>I beleive there passing thru that area at times. Those sounds I heard were never heard there before and I don''t hear them now when I go up there. Every now and then they seem to come back, but only when were outside sitting by the fire. Strange indeed. These woods go far as well and you could easily travel them and end up in New Hampshire or further without seeing a house.<BR><BR>As time goes by and the more I read about what other folks saw and the similarities between each story I''m more wanting to do some of my own investigating, but its very scary out there at night, especially for me. I carry a loaded .44 when I''m up there just because I have seen this thing up close enough to know what it was. No doubt in my mind. ",

    " I am 45 years old, have spent my whole life in the woods. I have been hunting and fishing since I was very young. On June 28th my wife and I decieded to take a walk in the woods. We were heading to a secluded resivior located aprox. 2 miles in the woods. We came upon a spot in the woods that seemed liked someone was watching us. We heard a noise come from some bushes. I thought it was a grunt from a buck. We both expected to a deer come outof the brush. I said, maybe it was a Bigfoot. She told me to shut up and keep walking. We walked for another 15 minutes and realized we were on the wrong path to the lake. We stopped, ate lunch and headed back into the woods. We had stopped at some power lines and sat in some shade. It was over 94 gegrees that day, and this was about noon time.<BR>As we walked back, we both noticed some very DEEP foot prints that did not look right. They were clearly 5 toed \"Human\" prints. In between the prints, was some deer tracks. The tracks clearly looked like the Human prints were chasing the deer prints. We both looked at each other and said, why would someone be running Barefoot, in 100 degree weather in the middle of the woods on a Tuesady afternoon? There were no other people in the woods at that time. The tracks were not there the first time we passed this spot, the noise was, the tracks were not. At this point I became very concerned that what ever made the prints was still in the area. I grabbed a big rock and told my wife to take some pictures with her cell phone. The tracks were about 6 to 7 feet apart. I could tell the first print was a right foot, that jumped out of the woods. The sixth and final step was a left foot that looked like it pushed off into the woods. No other tracks were before or after these six prints. We both became very nervous and started talking loudly and whistling. I did not want to run into this \"person\". We became a little confused and ended up on the worng path home. We walked for a couple hours, no way were we going back the way we came.<BR><BR><BR>Did not notice any smells or sounds. Just very quiet. No animal sound at all.",

    " Me and my wife picked my mother up from work in Lima, OH at 2 AM. We were traveling down 117S/E and turned left on Philips rd. We were on our way home and drove across the second bridge when a dark shape on the south side of the road caught my attention, and apparently my wife and mother also. I had not said anything until they said they saw something, my suspicions were now confirmed. I stopped the car and backed up. Whatever it was appeared to have been laying in the ditch that goes under the bridge and when I backed the car up it appeared to get up and lean over as if shielding itself and seemed as if it realized we could see it. The creature stood up and rushed at our car. It seemed that it covered about 30 feet effortlessly, it was very fast I think we were all shocked. I floored the car without thinking. I asked them if it was still behind us. They said it had come out into the road behind us. I got the feeling that it had wanted to scare us off. I questioned my wife and mother about what they had seen. We all saw the same thing. I just seen the immense size of it and it looked like it had very coarse looking hair. My mother and wife said it had a very large belly and was of a very thick build. My wife said it had a round head and no neck.",

    " I was driving northbound on route 146. I was driving with my sister (the only other person in the car) and she was looking down at her I-Pod and was in the front passenger seat. The traffic was average not too many cars but a few, and I was doing about 65-68 mph.  I looked about 3/4 of a mile ahead and saw something off to the rightside of the highway not on the highway but near the woodline on the grass. At first it looked like someone possibly in a gilley suit but then as I got closer I couldn''t believe my eyes because it looked just like what you hear about and see artist renderings of a bigfoot like creature. It was too tall to be a person in a suit approx. 7-8ft tall and very broad with black hair. I couldn''t see any specific facial features or chest features as it turned into the woods when i was about 1/8 of a mile away. It was walking parralell to the woodline then took a 90 degree turn into the woods. When I saw this I immediately slowed down to about 50mph and looked intently into the woodline by this time I was able to get my sisters attention (she was listening to music on the I-Pod looking down) we both stared into the woods and Icouldn''t see anything but see thinks she saw something black moving in the woods. I still can''t believe what I saw, there was no cars parked on the left or right shoulders of the highway. The creature did not appear to be running the entire sighting lasted for 7-8 seconds. I am very sure of what I saw it was a dark haired looked very much like a bear walking on two legs.",

About thirty seconds later I heard another one and that one caught my attention but I didn''t see it. It was bigger and it was in the middle of the swamp.

    " On this day, myself, a friend, Eddy and 2 girls, felt like taking a ride. Before I begin I just want it noted that there was NO drinking or the use of drugs. We decided to go to Plum Island. At the time, the refuge was free to enter and the entire road was dirt. That day there was no one in the refuge, as we drove down the road,  I noticed no cars the entire 6.3 miles of the refuge, it was empty, we drove to the end.  At the last small area to park, I pulled in, across the road was a narrow boardwalk that lead to a 50 foot observation tower. We all went up. We hung around up there for about a half hour, I started hearing noises, first I heard clicking, loud clicking, then short high pitched screams, it sounded maybe 100 yards away. I took a look around, but didnt see anything.  I noticed there was no one in the area.  I saw no birds or waterfowl.  The sounds went on for about 10 minutes or so, I felt uneasy at this point and said we should go. We all got in my car and started back out. I was only driving for a couple of minutes and I saw a very large dark figure cross the road from the marsh/brush area on the left to the right, which had heavy brush and that lead to the beach.  I immediately looked at Eddy and asked did you see that?  He answered Yes! We asked each other what it was. The girls in the back seat didnt see anything s they were to busy talking to each other. I slowed to almost a stop where what we saw it cross the road, there was solid brush that it went into, we could see where something went through the brush. There was no sign of  it, it was gone. The figure that crossed was huge, 7 feet or more, very wide, all black from head to toe. It was a little hunched forward as it walked upright. I noticed its arms were longer than average and they swung as it walked.  It took only three steps to cross the road. The road is about three cars wide. It had a smooth stride. It did not look in my direction,  just crossed the road and it was gone. I only saw it for about 5 seconds I could never forget the image of it crossing the road. <BR>I went back there today, my children wanted to see where I had the sighting.  I didnt make back up the observation tower because of these flies that nest in the marsh, they are Green Headed Flies, they are, as the woman in the office said, man eaters.  They bite hard. As you drive down the road, they follow the car, dozens fly around the car. So the kids didnt want to get out and get eaten by them and neither did I, so I didnt get up on the observation tower to take a look. I have told a few people what I saw and they think Im nuts.  My father looks at me strange because he knows I dont make up stories like this, I dont lie, so he just looks at me when I talk about it to him. I know what I saw, and I saw what I saw.",

    " Hi, my name is xxxxxx, I grew up in Rowley, MA.. a small old farming town established in 1639.. when I was 10, I''m now 27, my friend an I were attempting to find a way through the woods from his home street to a plaza containing a dunkin donuts for the fun of it. like I said, I grew up in the woods and this is only a distance of about a half of a mile. We started out heading in the direction we thought was good and after a while we heard a noise in the distance.. at this point we were pretty deep into just new England forest when we heard something. in the distance.. (far enough to be a hard definite sighting but close enough to be odd as hell to this day) so we looked obviously and in the middle of the woods.. randomly.. were three.. THREE, tanned brown.. (not brown black, or brown brown, but brown tan) upright creatures, running through the woods together. AS IF THEY WERE TRAVELING!!!! they were close and tight and jogging along on the hill we were on about 400 yards away.. we just watched speechless and then decided it was time to give up on finding our way and head back. I don''t know if he told anyone ever, but we lost touch over the years, but that sighting will forever connect us.. I just thought anyone who follows bigfoot should know about this.. these 3 creatures were tanned and brown, upright, jogging in a line, and fully unclothed.. I''ve seen one other unexplained sighting, but this one was absolutely dumbfounded.. I don''t know if anyone has ever seen multiple bigfoots traveling together but I have. ",

    " My dog was bothering me to go out ealry morning around 3 AM on November 25th 2000. It was very brisk out and I believe the weather was clear. Not sure about the lighting. As I was walking her, I could hear coyotes howling for a good few minutes from a distance and didn''t think much of it. Then a few minutes later after it had stopped, I was about to walk inside and heard this loud wailing coming from the woods. It literally sent a chill down my spine. It definitely was not human and not anything else I would recognize. We don''t have much wildlife bigger than deer and coyote. This went on till about 5:30 AM and kept me up. The wailing to me almost sounded depressing like it was upset or something. I told my friend''s father a few weeks later and he told me that he was out walking his dog a few years earlier and said that he clearly saw something in the woods watching him. He never told anyone because he thought no one would be lieve him. This happened across the major road by the resevoir early evening. ",

    " I was driving near the town dump about 1:00 in the afternoon around the end of June last year, it was raining very hard, a large figure came out of nowhere, I hit my brakes but was far enough back that I would not have hit it, there was a car coming at me the other way, it almost ran into the back end of that car, it turned a little sideways to avoid the car, that''s when I knew it was not a person or a bear, when it turned it flung its arm up and back a little to miss the car, it was a little hunched over, its shoulders were extremely wide, I couldn''t make out any facial features, it was covered in dark brown hair and appeared to have hardly any neck, it was about 6\" taller than the mini van it almost ran into, if it was standing straight up I would guess it was about 6 to 6 and a half feet tall. The whole thing only took about 2 or 3 seconds but it really shook me up. I have always hiked in the woods around here and done a lot of tracking animals of all kinds, I have never seen anything that would resemble a bigfoot track, I have always had doubts about people seeing these, but now I will never doubt it again. It won''t keep me from the woods but I''ll keep an eye peeled from now on.",

    "    It was a mild day and I decided to take a walk in the woods. After traveling about 5 or 10 minutes down a woods road I heard 3 deliberate and distinct knocks which emanated about 50 yards away from inside the brush off to my left, it stopped me dead in my tracks. I have read many of the incidents on BFRO and I could not believe what I was hearing. I composed my self and found what I considered a sturdy stick and struck a large pine tree close by in the same manner as I had just heard. It took about 5 seconds and a reply came back but only 2 deliberate knocks this time. A couple of seconds later  another sound came from a direction parallel  to the first but about 50 yards apart. This sound was like a tree being struck but with the stick breaking on impact. When the stick broke it sounded like it had a girth of a couple of inches. I struck my tree 3 more times but nothing more happened. Let me add that as I was strolling down this trail I was smoking a cigar and the wind was blowing into the direction that the knocks came from.  I continued down the trail which takes you to the edge of a pond. While exploring there I found an interesting thing. Lying on the ground was what looked like a 3 foot wooden club with a jagged end where the roots would be, it looked like something that you would see in a cave man picture. There were also 2 holes in the ground one next to a tree, the hole about 12 inches in diameter and close to 20 inches deep the other about 5 feet away from the tree 3 or 4 inches in diameter and only 4 or 5 inches deep with the club laying on its side and the small end partially in that hole. I believe that this club dug both holes because of the way the end was all rounded and imbedded with dirt. But I do not understand why.<BR>      I decided to go back the next day for photographs and I brought a yard stick with me to get these measurements. When returning  the next day I discovered a good size pile of feces on the trail about 15 feet away from the tree I had knocked on. Nothing unusual took place this day but I did take a few pictures of various other things as well which may or may not be relevant. What or who  made those knocks I will probably never know but be clear on this they were distinct, clear, timed and deliberate, of this I am sure.          <BR>",

    "I do recall now after reading some accounts - about a \"path\" deep in the woods about a mile long that ran parallel to the houses. It was about 500 feet back of my house along an old stone wall. It was covered ( canopy of trees) and very dark-even on bright days. I would occasionally walk through the woods and found this path. The entrance was through the woods 1/4 mile down the street and through a dense pine grove - you would then enter an open field and then enter this dark section of woods. I found an irregular path that rambled - but always wondered why there were many broken branches and samll trees and closed in areas(like small trees pulled together) and the rocks in the wall would be all over the place - some of them were good size. I always thought that maybe some kids used this path to school or built forts or something but I now realize it was too dense and not really in the right direction to the schools. I never heard any kids out back in all the years I have been here (almost 30 years)",

    " Twenty Five years ago (1979) I heard the most awful and terrifying screams for 3 nights in a row. We had just built a two story addition which is situated further back on a lot (about 150 feet) into the woods from the street. This area was considered suburban but was fairly rural at that time. There are houses built along the street that are on lots of 3/4 to 1 acre. We own several acres of heavily wooded land and our house sits back on the lot further than the others. The section of woods is borderd by 3 state highways and was about 1 mile (length) by 1 1/2 miles (width)of woods and some farmland fields. At the time there were only two dead end streets that penetrated this section of woods. Another country road separates this section on the west with a State park nearby (1/2 mile from the road). This park is several hundred acres of lakes and heavily wooded areas. The area now is filled with housing and development.<BR><BR>It was July and was very hot (90 degrees +) and the peepers were very loud. Each evening between 2:00 and 3:30 a.m. an extremely loud howling, screaming sound would start far away. As it came closer ( the screams lasted for 20-30 seconds each and occurred every 1-2 minutes or so) you could hear bushes and branches being swept out of the way with loud crunching and breaking sounds and screams that would get louder in intensity. The woods at that time were covered with thick vines and brambles that were about 3-5 feet high. It was extremely difficult to walk through any section of the woods that was not cleared. You just didn''t stroll through the woods, especially in the pitch black. When this \"thing\" came closer all the peepers and the night sounds completely ceased. The sound was so loud in volume that it actually caused you to \"freeze\" - I mean that it ran your blood cold!  I remember laying in bed not wanting to investigate because whatever it was - it was BIG and I did not want to find out what it was! It was not the sound of a bear, a mountain lion or a wounded deer.The sound had a human quality about it and was like - it was searching for something and had a sense of pain or distress abut it. It would travel parallel through the woods about 100 feet behind my house. On the third night I got up immediately and waited for this thing to get closer. I have a switch in the bedroom that would turn on some roof mounted flood lights that would shine in the back yard. We did not have a deck or anything at the time and the woods were about 25 feet behind the house. This thing was crashing through the woods and when it was right behind the house it gave out this huge loud moan. I was looking out the window with all the inside lights out and then I turned on the floodlights. The scream stopped and there was silence for about 5 seconds and then it crashed through the woods away from the house very quickly opposite the direction it came from. You could hear the crashing of a two footed creature. I heard the crashing sounds for about another minute and then it faded and was quiet. I was really spooked and went downstairs and started turning on all the lights and the outside lights. I noticed that all my neighbors were turning on their outside lights as well. This was unusual because no one left outside lights on and there were no street lights in this section of the street.There were at least 4 other houses that turned their lights on. I contemplated whether to call the police but did not. The next day while mowing the lawn, my elderly neighbor across the street from me came over and said \"Dave, did you hear those sounds last night? I have heard them for several nights and almost called the cops - if I hear it again I am calling the police - I never heard anything like that in my life.\" I agreed and it was good that someone else confirmed the incident to me. All these years I have only told close friends of this story and the kidding I take is unmerciful- but I know to this day what I heard was absolutely real. I forgot about it for many years until I saw some \"bigfoot\" documentary in the early 1990''s. They played a recording and when I heard it- it brought back the whole incident. It was almost identical to the sound! I have played the sound recordings on various websights and would say that it was pretty close to the Ohio or Pennsylvania recordings. I never heard anything after 1979 and I did not see anything. Perhaps others have given reports from this area and this report may be helpful. I am being truthful about this - I do not drink or do any nonprescription drugs - I am a church administrator in a Bible (nondenominational) church.  ",

    " I''ve told very few people this story for fear that they might think I''m crazy. The only reason why I''m taking the time to report this is because of a recent entry a friend of mine who knew my story told me about.<BR><BR>My story takes place in Charlestown, Rhode Island in the late 1970''s. My mother and father and I lived in a wooded area abutting the \"Indian Cedar Swamp\" and property owned by United Nuclear which probably comprises several thousand acres. The property surrounding our home was mixed  white Atlantic juniper swamp,scarlet, red and white oaks with old growth white pine stands mixed in, with a dense understory of briars, mountain laurel and blue berry brush.<BR><BR>We lived off a road with 3 houses on it. The houses were all built close to the entrance of this development. The road was part of a series of roads that were put in as the start of a development. The roads were oiled gravel and had been left to grow in after years of little or no use. It looked like the developer had started and went belly-up.<BR><BR>These roads were great to ride bikes on or take a evening cruise on after bringing my father dinner at his second job. My mother drove a baby blue Mustang Mach 1 and she would drive around the roads with me looking at deer before we retired to our home for the evening. As a kid I remember this being a highlight to the evening.<BR><BR>I was at the time maybe 8 years old and my mother and I on this particular night in the late 70''s commenced our ride around the roads to see if we sould see any deer. It had been raining earlier with thunder and lightning mixed in. Now it was just raining. We were rounding a corner on one of the roads that paralleled the Indian Cedar Swamp and as we started downward,  we noticed the road was obstructed by a large blown down oak tree, the tree had green leaves (this makes me think it was summer or the early fall) on it so it had recently come down, we guessed maybe in the storm earlier(possibly lightning).<BR><BR>The road was very narrow and the brush along the side of the road made it difficult to back the car around to turn around. The rain was falling but not heavy, the wipers were on, the headlights on the car were on as well.<BR><BR>As my mother turned the front end  of the car the lights cast on the left side of the road where the tree had been broken off from its stump. We were maybe 1 1/2 car lengths from the stump. Beside the tall fractured stump stood what looked like a large white(yellow white) ape. It was maybe 6 to 7 feet tall, its hair was long, face flat, long massive arms, its head appeared to be without any neck, its chest was broad.<BR><BR>My mother and I froze momentarily (5 seconds, maybe 10) and the figure remained still, staring at us. My mother floored the car into reverse. I remember ther terror of it all. The sound of gravel hitting inside the fender wells, the sound of the brush crushing against the car and then the acceleration as she sped off.<BR><BR>We were clear as to what we saw and we have no question in our mind that we saw something or someone in ape like shape that night. This we are certain of. We need no one to tall us what we saw, it''s crystal clear.<BR><BR>For years we told no one. We would talk about it in our home in privacy and even my father found this story hard to accept. We''ve never forgotten this and this story would have never been told if it wasn''t for someone else informing me of a similar sigthing.<BR><BR>I''m now in my 30''s an extremely active hunter, farmer and woodsman. I hunt deer 40 days a year in Maine, RI, CT and New Jersey. I use automated cameras which are triggered by heat. I''ve never seen a picture of a bigfoot on my film. I have seen pictures of deer on my 50 acre tract of land that I would never believe are there if I didn''t see it on my film. I know every inch of my land and the surrounding property and these mystery deer show up at all hours on my cameras and frequently at that. How can they move right around our hunting parties in such a small area and never be seen, I''ll never know,<BR><BR>Even today I find it hard to accept what we definitely saw. I''m not a fan of ghosts, UFO''s or even big foot. I''m not sure to this day what I saw wasn''t a man in a costume, dressed up, out in rainstorm, a half mile or more from any home, waiting for my mother and me to drive down the road to give us a scare. The only thing I can say is it was a damn'' good costume and a damn'' good plan. We saw what we saw and this is something I would sware to on any polygraph test as I''m sure my mother would.<BR><BR>",

    " The exact date was October 15, 1998. I was training for a mountain bike race and this was to be my last ride prior to the race. I was riding at the Black Hut Management Area in Glendale,RI. Along for the ride was my three year old mixed breed (shepard/lab)large dog.<BR>It was sunny but cool and I planned to spend an hour or so breaking a swet. <BR>As i weaved my way through the trails, i had to leash my dog to cross a street. After I unhooked him we started up a hill toward a chasam. It''s small and kids hang around there and drink beer, have fires etc. At the crest of the hill I could see the top of the chasam (approx. 50 yards away). Out of the corner of my eye I noticed something that first appeared to be a dirty white blanket perhaps hung on a small tree. Suddenly (I think it heard us)it turned (as it was squatting with it''s back to me)saw me stood up and disapeared into the woods. I was shocked and could not believe what I had just saw. From my vantage point I would say the animal was white or grey but very dirty. In no way did it resemble a man. I did not see the face clearly. But from what I did see (full rear view) although it stood fairly erect, it''s gate and posture was like an ape. The arms were not long like a gorilla and oddly it was no were near seven-feet tall. I''d estimate maybe six feet at best.<BR>I reversed my direction and rode immediately to the top of the chasam. I looked for footprints and hair but didn''t find any. I walked a short distance in the woods in the direction were it disapeared. My heart was pounding so loud I could hear it. I knew it was no were in the general area because my dog was not barking. Anytime there is an animal near fox, coyote, deer, my dog barks and will usally chase. Interesting point is that my dog never barked and I don''t think he saw, heard or smelled it. I noticed no unusual smell in the area. And also noted no signs of broken branches and no way to determine its direction. <BR>I''ve told one or two people and in November of 1998 a friend and I (with video and digital camera) spent two weekends hiking in the area directly behind the chasam with no results. I also snow shoed the area after the first snow. I was starting to believe I had imagined it. In 2002 I met a hunter in a bar and asked him if he ever hunted at Black Hut. He said \"yes\", \"and once I saw a white gorilla there! I had chills and related my story. The differences were in color, he stated white (the one i saw was more grey) and said the one he saw was eight feet tall. Still, same place same type of sighting.<BR>What made me write this is the two other RI sightings seem to be similar. I wish I could have seen it longer and closer.         <BR>     ",

    "   While attending U.R.I in the Fall of 1974,I would stay at my girlfriends mother''s house on weekends because I only had a five day mealbook plan.<BR>  It was Sunday evening about 10:00pm when I decided to head back to school on my ten speed bike. Very dark in the area because it being mostly wooded, country like setting but yet city. I was going down her street and noticed my front center pull brake needed to be adjusted. I stopped under a street light at the end of her street which is an intersection to adjust the brake. Directly in front of me was a small field that sloped down and away from me,pitch black background, tall grass and a few bushes being light by the street light. Typical New England, Oak, Maple and, Pine trees.<BR>  As I was fixing my brake I began hearing very loud foot steps of a biped, comig from the field on the slope side,more like a crushing thud. I could hear the actual compression being placed, like someone dropping a heavy metal ball/rock on the ground.I looked up to see if I could see anything and just said to myself \"its nothing\", and went back to fixing my brake. I noticed it was getting closer and felt very apprehensive, the sound was coming in my direction. All of sudden this dog starts barking like crazy, I can hear the chain snap as it either tries to attack or getaway from something.<BR>  I said to myself \"its time to go!\", as I started I turned left to head north, into a few pedals.<BR>From out of the darkness steps into the street light this white looking gorilla. The legs present themselves then the body as it comes to rest on its knuckles. Twenty maybe twenty five feet away, directly across the street from me perhads six feet tall maybe 400 pounds or more. Massive arms that went straight down on its knuckles, knees slight bent.The head is higher in the back connected to the neck all-in-one mass. The face dark, deep strong  but primate.The eyes are close together and set deep in the face. The nose and mouth are human like, it''s nose is wide, around the mouth black hair that went down on each side.It looks up with its head and chest see me, eyeball to eyeball as I look back trying to see if this thing is real. Humanlike in appearance, the face is not like a primate but has a distinct animal presence (the eye are close together). I was never so scared in my life and knew had I stayed I don''t think I would of survived the attack.The way it was positioned gave it an explosive start as it decides to chase me down the street. My heart was pounding out of my chest, my eyes had tears in them and with all my might I pedaled as it ran on two legs, then down on its knuckles then back up again. Perhaps for ten yards, I remember how its long hair on its arms moved with each reach,I thank god I was in first gear. A good five second chase and it was all over.It had stopped in the middle of the street just swaying back and forth, turned and just cleared this rock wall all in one motion from a grass sidewalk. At the top of hill I began riding in circles, I didn''t know what to do, I could not comprehend the situation I was in. I knew one thing I was not riding back. I cut through her grandmother''s yards and made it back to her house. Not trying to look crazy or anything they ask me what''s wrong ? I told them what happened and agreed  that it was best to go back in the morning.",

    "  I am 61-yo and have been an outdoorsman all of my life doing numerous backpacking and mountaineering trips in the Cascades and Olympics. I have a degree in psychology from the UW and currently employed as an Investigator. <BR><BR>My 15-yo son and I made camp at twilight off FS road 25,  after doing a recon of the Lewis River area for hunting. It is a rain forest there with huge cedar trees and large moss-covered maples reminding me of the Hoh Rain Forest. We set up camp on the east side of a creek. We had my 4-Runner parked and set up a tent. <BR><BR> After a steak dinner, I made some howls in the manner of the \"Ohio howls\" that I had made that had called in a Squatch at Lake Ozette (report #65667). I am a trained vocalist and can project my voice considerably. After no response, we retired for the evening.<BR><BR> At approx 10 pm, we were awakened by a loud crack of a branch very close to our tent. I jumped out of my bag with a 400-lumen flashlight and searched 360 degrees hoping to spot the culprit. After several minutes and intense searching to no avail, we went back to sleep only to be woken by howls off in the distance to the south of us an hour later. I would guess that the howls were coming from a single individual approx a mile away from us. My son reported that he had heard footsteps later near the tent that night but failed to wake me. <BR><BR> In the morning, my son discovered a single footprint near the tent. I have photos. It is a very wide right footprint approx a size 13 that was very deep (1/2 inch) in the dirt. I am sure the print is still there as it has not rained since drafting this report. Despite a large rock in the near middle of the arch, the print is deep and was not affected by it. I could not make a print at all and I weigh 250lbs.<BR><BR> I have always been keenly interested in Sasquatch and was convinced that they exist after reading Dr. Meldrum''s Where legend Meets Science book.  I have had encounters after mimicking the Ohio Howl with remarkable success. I suspect the government has proof and is keeping it quiet to protect this cryptohominid with wilderness areas (Lone Butte/Indian Heaven). I am studying maps of an area I reasoned to be prime habitat and have a trip planned overland off-trail/road soon. Time to get serious... ",

    " I have recently become very interested in bigfoot research, and based on reports that I found on this website of previous incidents in the area, decided to go to Great Swamp in Rhode Island to look for any evidence of bigfoot. After walking thirty to forty minutes down the main trail beginning from Great Neck Road, I took a smaller path off of the trail for about five minutes. That is when I noticed a young tree that was snapped in half at about six feet off the ground. More noteworthy, however, was a stick formation that I found a little bit farther down the path on a slightly elevated area of land. It was small, maybe three feet high, but constructed in the same woven-looking manner characteristic of other possible bigfoot stick formations. Other than that, I did not find anything else unusual. It may not be extremely compelling evidence, but I figured it was worth telling experts, who could then take it as far as they saw fit.",

    " My girlfriend and I were staying at her parent''s house near Marlborough, New Hampshire.  I am writing on her behalf because of my access to the internet.  I also have an interest in bigfoot related stories and lore and so am familiar with this website.  However, I have not had any experiences or encounters myself.  <BR>This particular night, my girlfriend was startled by an unusual howling scream while watching t.v. at approximately 11:45 p.m. (her father and I were asleep and did not hear anything).  The howling scream seemed to eminate from across the street in an area that is heavily wooded.  At the first scream she thought that she must have heared an injured person''s cry.  There were approximately four screams (although she is unsure about this), each about 5 seconds apart.  After hearing the second scream she went to the front door (about 10'' from her) and stood outside on the stoop where she heard the last two screams.<BR>She estimated the distance to the screams as approximately 400 feet, to the other side of the street where there is a solitary house.  I believe, however, that the screams may have been much farther away.  She says that they were ''very loud'' and stationary, i.e. they didn''t sound louder or fainter with each progressive one.  She also notes that they sounded as if from around the corner of the house, not a clear shot from her to the point of origin.  In other words, she doesn''t beleive that the ''animal'' could have seen her at the front door.<BR>The next day she described what she heard to me and I immediately thought of the recordings from your site.  Her description sounded alike.  After returning from our trip I played the recordings to her (over the phone) and she says, \"identical,\" specifically the 1978 recording from Snohomish County, Washington.   ",

    " Audio Experience only:<BR><BR>Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, wooo....<BR><BR>Sunday, September 12, 2004 at about 03:00 AM<BR>I was woken up from a sound sleep by a very loud noise.  I listened for a while and tried to figure out what could make such a loud, repetitive noise.  It wasn''t a coyote howl or fishercat screach, didn''t sound like any owl I know of, wasn''t a raccoon or tree rodent...  After 15 - 20 minutes, I went to sleep.<BR><BR>My dog woke me with frightened barking at 4:00 AM when the sound was twice as loud and I knew the critter was within 100 feet of the house.  Also, there were two responding calls, one sounded fairly close and one was in the distance.  I got up to make sure the sheep were OK in their pasture with an electric fence around it and there was nothing by the barn where the goats were.  I flashed the light over to the chicken coop and nothing was there either.  I flashed the light throughout the yard and into the trees to see if there was any clue or any danger to the animals.  I saw nothing and while I shone the light, the calls ceased.<BR><BR>All day I asked EVERYONE if they knew of any local animal that made the noise and repeated it all day long.  A friend suggested that I look it up on the internet.  I listened to all sorts of animal vocalizations with no luck.  When I finally typed in the words of the actual sound it was an identical match to this site!!!  I''m not saying I had a bigfoot encounter, but I definately encountered whatever the campers up in Lincoln, NH encountered last summer!!!  There may be a rational explaination and someone may know of an indigenous animal that makes that sound -- and trust that I will still try to find out what it is... but the sound will resonate in my memory -- as it was like no other animal/bird I''ve ever heard.  It was not too fast, nor garbled, it was incredibly loud and clear.  The dog was very nervous.",

    "       I moved to this location in New Hampshire  in 2001. I have had several sightings over the past few years. Usually from my living room while I am watching television. I know this sounds weird. But, I am serious. My couch sits facing my picture window. Beyond the picture window, there is a small creek and an empty wooded lot. I have seen deer, bear, turkey, racoons, moose and fox on my property.  It is in a part of Gilford called Gunstock Acres. It usually happens in the late evening on a dark summer night. No paticular date or time. From the ground to the top of the window has got to be at least 10 feet tall. This creature is about 9 feet in height. Dark deep brownish long hair, and walks upright, similar to a human. I have seen it go one direction, then go past the window in the other direction several minutes later, or it just walks away until the next time I see it, which has been about once a year. I have seen it looking more like a shadow when my lights in the house are on. I am usually caught off guard, and am startled when I''ve seen it, in disbelief, but there is no other explanation. <BR>      Last summer I happened to tell my husband and family that I saw Bigfoot again last night and my oldest son said he seen it the night before, passing by the window, and it looked right in at him as it was passing by. He described the same creature except that he saw the face. And he swears it is a Bigfoot too.  He was creeped out about it, and I think he still is. My son is in his 20''s.<BR>      This is part of the Great North Woods, with lakes, mountains, rivers & caves. Plenty of places to hide. I have heard strange grunting noises, tree limbs breaking, screams, and walking sounds through my wooded lot. I refuse to go outside after I have seen it, and turn all the outside lights on, until I forget about it again. We have seen some huge prints out there in the winter going around the house, but they were unidentifiable.  Due to the large amounts of snow we have gotten during storms, the tracks get filled in.<BR>      I am spooked by it, but it hasn''t done anything to any of us, except  look in the window at us.<BR>      I know what I have seen, and I haven''t told many people as they would think we were crazy. So, my family and I would like to know what this creature is, and is it possible that it is a Bigfoot? We beleive it is, as we know what we have seen. It can''t be a black bear, as this is too tall, and walks a distance on two legs and like a human, so it couldn''t be a moose either.  It is built like a really large broad-shouldered man, and muscular, but covered in hair. My son said that the face is hairy also, but the skin on the face is a lighter color than the rest of the body. ",

Then it turned straight & strided toward the edge of the road. There was no path on either side of the road just very thick woods & underbrush. We have stone walls everywhere here in NH. The creature never broke stride as it stepped lithfully over the stone wall & slid with ease through the thick under-brush. A human would have to bend down to use hands to clumsily straddle the stonewall, to get to the other side. There are no houses to \"trick-or-treat\". And who would be out in the middle of nowhere, in the near freezing (35*) cold, just mosying through the thick pickerbrush in a hairy costume?!?!?! We had never heard of bigfoot, didn''t know such a thing existed.There is also a family up in the woods of the Gilmanton area who have had Bigfoot visits for years.

    " In one part of Bearbrook State Park is the Girl Scout Day Camp location. Across the street from New Rye Rd is the Camping Museum & the Snowmobile Museum. There used to be a nature museum. If you keep going straight on that dirt path, you wind yourself up into the Girl Scout Campground. It was a 2 week event. The older campers were allowed to have a single overnight in the last few days. It was ''67/''68, late July. There were 3, 5-person tents, I was a senior and in the tent closest to the woods. The evening was spent cooking hotdogs & hamburgers & marshmallows & sa''mores with lots of singing laughing & screaming. We all retired around 10 pm. In the middle of the night, around 1 or 2 am, I was woken by something softly grunting & pushing down on the top of the tent. We have racoons but no bears in (I get the irony) Bear Brook State Park. The other girls in my tent were trying to stay quiet, but still panicking not so quietly. I said \" it''s just one of the other girls.\" I am a camper since age 9 with a father who was a practical joker. So I said loudly \"That''s not how you do it. This is how it is done\" & I dug my nails into the canvas & making a roaring growling sound clawed down the canvas hard & fast & hit something soft but solid on the outside of the cloth. I was picturing a man''s hand/fist kind of like knuckles???. There was a loud grunt/growl & crashing away from us through the underbrush just on the other side of the tent. Now the girls in my tent are screaming hysterically about bears, The rest of the campers are opening my tent and all pandemonium broke loose. No-one admitted to playing a prank. & the leaders in the other 2 tents all day insisted everyone was accounted for & no one had left the tents not even a potty run. There was a funky smell though, that no-one could recognize. The park rangers swore there were none in the area, they were all up north for the summer. We had never heard of bigfoot, I fear I am repeating myself, so didn''t even know such a thing existed. So, unexplainable incident, that with hindsight, I am thinking, could it have been???

From inside the house we heard what we thought was barking constantly.  We own several dogs so we were used to it.  this continued for about an hour or two then quieted down.  Later on that evening about 2am or so we heard the most bloodcurdling sound ever.  The only way i can describe it is like about 20 dogs all screaming and yaulping at once in a shrill chorused scream.  We haven''t heard it again but it came from across the farmer''s field in the woods across from The speedway.  I''d have to say the date was around January 10th or so.  We have heard other things too and seen plenty of deer...but never heading across the field.  We don''t know what it was and did not see it at all.

    " My boyfriend and two sons (age 5 & 10) were camping in Upton, Maine.  On July 3rd, 1998 we took a ride into Parmachenee Lake.  The road to get there is off Rt. 16 in Wilsons Mills, ME.  We drove around most of the day, stopped for a cookout on someones lot and then headed out in the early afternoon.   It was before 4:00 p.m.   We were riding in a truck, my friend driving and the two boys in the middle and I was on the passenger side.   We came out of what I would call a wooded area at the top of a small hill, the hill rounded a small corner and then straightened out at the bottom.  The entire area on the right side was an open area at the bottom, the left side was wooded.  There were no vehicles around there or anywhere for that matter.   Just as we rounded we could see at the very bottom of the slight downgrade (approx. 100-150 yds).   We both saw it at the same time.  He looked at me immediately and said \"what did you just see\", I looked at him and without even thinking and said \"saskatchewan\".   <BR>What we saw was something unimaginable.   The creature (?) was standing on two legs, was very tall (approx. 7 feet), skinney and was totally covered with long brown hair/fur.  What was amazing was this creature never even acknowledged that we were coming towards him in the truck, although we were not close enough to hit it, it never acknowledged.   The other amazing thing was that it''s strides were huge.  It took it probably three strides to cross the dirt road, which was wide enough for two vehicles.   It''s gait was very stoic.   We got down to the bottom within seconds, we slowed right down almost to a stop and looked into the woods.   There was nothing in there.   My boyfriend wanted to stop but I wouldn''t let him because of the children.  We also stopped discussing it at that time in fear of scaring the kids.  There were no tracks on the ground.   We intended to return the next day to see if we could track anything but it rained really hard that night so we figured any tracks were gone.<BR>I told this story to very few people because I know it''s hard to believe.   I did tell one of the foresters that worked where I did.   This road we went on is gated and I was able to get a key from my employer.   This is why I mentioned it to the forester.  I was hoping maybe he had heard similar stories.    <BR>The creature was on Bose Buck Mountain and headed towards Aziscohos Lake.   Also in that area was an old gate near mile marker #12.<BR><BR><BR>",

    " While on vacation with my wife in northern NH/ME area called Lake Aziscohos. we decided to go moose antler hunting to find some dropped racks. while heading into a clearing we started following moose tracks, we went further past the clearing and came to a small water run-off ditch. Well in this small ditch we saw a very unusual track for anywhere in the northeast, a five toe''d track that was HUGE!!! I took pictures, I did not have casting material, but i do have pictures with an altoids box for size comparison, we estimated this track to be between 20-22\" long and I''d say about 8-10\" wide. this was NOT, I repeat NOT like any other tracks we have seen, the track had no claw marks, I''ve been an avid watcher of Finding Bigfoot and do wood knocks regularly along with screams.

The creature came out of the reeds and was crouched down looking at me through them. Surprisingly it got out of the reeds from crouched to standing turned around and ran towards the wooded area up a hill and was moving with it''s arms brush and tree branches out of the way. It was incredibly fast runner and I got a good look at its coconut shaped head as it ran away. It was light brown/brown. It had incredibly broad shoulders. I went back the same day. The marsh went up to my knees and I could smell a bad odor like garbage. Myself and a friend went back to the sighting. We found a footprint and a hair sample. I could hear wood knocks when my friend James did a call and we also found a large bed of branches and some tree structures.

We walked to the end of the dirt road and along that road is a tree lining of woods. As we started heading back I looked over a noticed a tall figure staring at me at the edge of the woods. I couldnt make out what it was. It was definitely taller than 7ft and stood on two legs. It had orangish eyes. I started walking back down the road towards my house and when I would stop it would stop an look at me. I would walk some more, so would the thing and then once I stopped it stopped and would look at me. At this point I was really freaked out so I yelled for my dog to run and we sprinted towards the house.

I was about an hour into my trek and I see off the beaten path a series of footprints. The snow had stopped yesterday and I tell you these prints were FRESH. I am thinking I just missed that squatch by a matter of minutes or hours! SO CLOSE! Well, let me tell you what!! These things were 12'''' long and the stride between steps was measured at 8 feet! The line of prints was straight, just like you see with other evidence of a bigfoot trail! It was INSANE. There were no other prints around, I followed these about a quarter mile into the depths of the woods and off the beaten path. The snow was up past my knees at some points but how could I stop following this epic trail! I could see some prints more clearly than others, I could see toe outlines and the heel in a few! I have pictures and videos to share with you. By the looks of the size of the prints and the distance in stride, this seems like an adult sasquatch, These things were huge!! The sun was setting and my phone was dying so to my dismay I had to turn around and get back to the path before dark, otherwise I would have followed those tracks until they lead me to whatever made them, and we know what made those beasts!

    "  In the spring of 1974 my girlfriend and I were returning from a motorcycle rally at Laconia NH.It was late at night and we decided to camp out.I found a small gravel road and we found a remote place to set up my small 2 man tent.This area is referred to as the pine barrens in the Kennebunk area of Maine.It has very thick scrub pine growth. <BR> About an hour or so after camping I could hear movement near the tent but was not too concerned because there is a lot of wildlife in the barrens.The movement got closer and there was this really pungent order.I thought \"uh-oh it''s a bear\"but was still not concerned as black bears are mostly just curious and usually will not bother you.<BR> I should add here that I have spent a lot of time in the woods as my mother and father were both Maine guides and the woods was my life.I have heard all the noises that wildlife makes in different seasons.I consider myself a good tracker and know the habits etc. of most animals.<BR> Then it happened:Whatever it was let out a scream that made every hair on my body stand striaght out and nearly gave me a heart attack.I am saying to myself\"this is no bear.\"Now the girlfriend is awake and in hysterics.I am trying to quiet her so I can keep track of whatever it is.It moved close enough to the tent so I could actually feel it''s movement through the ground and hear it breathing.This activity went on for about 20 minutes and it went away.<BR> After a sleeplees night and at first light I crawled out to investigate.I looked for tracks.There were no clear imprints,only impessions in the grass and some broken ferns etc.The impessions were about half again as big as my own.I wear a size 11.I followed the tracks and they ended at a cliff that was about 30 feet high.I wanted to investigate further but the girlfriend was haveing none of it and wanted to leave.I went back a couple of times by myself to that area but never found any further signs in the area.<BR> This all would have been disturbing enough but that year I was liesurly sipping a beer an watching a documentry on bigfoot with my girlfriend when they played a recording that was supposed to be a bigfoot scream.YOu guessed it...Hair straight out and and an exclamation from both of us of \"Oh sh--!\"If that was bigfoot then we have been very close to him.",

It stopped when it noticed us and took a fast left turn into the woods. <BR><BR>From the power lines to the road is roughly 400 ft of woods and has a trail about 30 feet behind where we saw the creature that goes straight to the road. I jumped on the 4 wheeler and made a straight shot down that trail to the road to try and get a closer view. It was completely gone.

    " I am a Ph.D. environmental physiologist working for Natick Labs in Massachusetts. In the fall of 1970, I was hunting on the east side of the lake [Long Pond] in Baxter State Forest with Danny Wolfe, a vet now in Ohio, a friend from Montana (deceased) and another vet. One morning I hunted alone south of the lake, when I encountered a strange musky smell in the woods along with a foot-long black scat that looked human except for the extraordinary thickness and width. I also observed small scat that looked like a large pile of baby feces with white and yellow texture. As I proceeded on, I was confronted with the sound of thumping like a partridge on steroids drumming. The ground actually shook. The hair on my neck was raised and the pit of my stomach seemed suddenly queasy as the rotten smell got worse. Suddenly, a large dead tree came crashing down about a hundred yards in front of me. This scared the s... out of me, as the woods were deathly quiet, no wind, no birds etc. I returned to camp and was severely guffawed by the two vets, Dr. Heisel and Dr. Wolfe.<BR><BR> Wolfe, however, agreed to accompany me the next day. We went further into the swampy woods, saw yesterday''s scat and Danny said whatever it was it was certainly big to push that dead tree down. We continued until the area became quite rocky with boulders larger than our heads on all sides. Danny said this doesn''t look like a good place to be because something could jump us before we could react. Suddenly, we encountered the drumming and ground shaking again. This was followed by a huge rock, which flew over our heads and impacted on a hill to our left. Needless to say, we were both speechless and Danny said whatever could throw a fifty-pound rock fifty yards was not something he would care to encounter. Even though Danny had a 7 mm mag and I had a 270, we both agreed to leave.  It was quite evident that whatever we had pissed off was clearly warning us not to go further.  We returned to camp and my two friends became believers. <BR><BR>The hunt was a failure because there were no signs of deer or even moose in the area. We have enjoyed retelling this story to our kids and friends over the years because none of us had ever experienced anything like it in years of hunting in Me, NH, MA, Montana or Colorado. It was the scariest thing I have ever encountered in my hunting career. <BR><BR>I have shot elk in Colorado and this year my wife and I shot over fifty pheasants and five deer. I am on the Board of Advisors of the Uxbridge Rod and Gun club, and as the Army''s former expert on desert survival and heatstroke physiology (Editorial Board of Wilderness and Environmental Medicine; I wrote the survival manual for Desert Storm and Desert Shield). I have published over 200 scientific papers, abstracts, and book chapters. But this is the first time I have written about this strange encounter! I am 65 and have retired from Army Environmental Medicine as a lab director.<BR>",

    " Background:  I have spent a large part of my life in the woods between Eddington where I grew up and Deblois where my Grandfather built a hunting / fishing camp in the 1920s  everywhere in between hunting, fishing, camping and hiking.  I have walked those woods since I was 4 years old and Im now 61  I know the deer, moose , bear and other wildlife of those woods.  I built my camp on Spectacle Pond in Osborn in 1988.  I have spent a lot of time in the years since exploring the woods and waters around the camp over the years and know the area between Route 179 and Route 193 better than most and within 10 miles of my camp, better than anyone.  Since 2008 when I retired from the U.S. Navy, I have spent one month every year at my camp  2 weeks in May, fishing and 2 weeks in November, hunting.  I have spent many days and nights in the most remote areas of that part of Maine.<BR><BR>On the evening of November 12th  2020, my wife and I had returned to our camp after an afternoon deer hunt, it was dark by the time we got back to camp and settled in for a routine evening with getting the camp warmed up, supper, a couple hands of cribbage and talking  we had been in camp for 10 days.  At around 8:30 my wife decided to go to bed as we planned to hunt the morning.  I picked up my book and was reading until 10:30.  The only light within a half mile of my camp was the single gas light in the front room of the camp which I was using to read  the nearest people were 0.5 mile away in their camp back toward Route 9.  I decided to call it a night at 10:30 and wanted to relieve myself before I went to bed so I went outside across the porch, down the front steps and walked approximately 15 feet to the back outside corner of the camp.  Within seconds of standing in that spot there was two very loud THWACK sounds just inside the woodline which is 15 yards across the back yard.  It took me by surprise as Ive never heard that sound before completely by myself in the woods.  It sounded identical to someone taking a large stick of firewood and hitting a tree in full swing.  I could easily replicate that noise as in knocking snow/ice off firewood against a tree, but with force.  I did not have a flashlight with me as the diffused light from the gas light inside the camp gave me enough point of reference to get back inside so I didnt think to bring one with me.  I stood there perplexed as to what I had just heard and trying to make sense of it, when it happened againTHWACK but this time a little farther away  maybe 25-30 yards, but still quite loud.  This repeated itself 10 or 11 times over a period of maybe 2 to 3 minutes, each time a little more distant than before.  I remained standing there as I was still trying to figure out what it was THWACKing these trees.  After the hitting of trees dissipated, I returned to the camp and locked the door  I didnt (and still dont) know what it was but I knew it wasnt a person, moose, deer or bear!  Of note, there was absolutely no light as in a flashlight from a person.  Additionally, those woods are extremely thick with dead spruce and fir  lots of blowdowns yet there was absolutely no noise  no snapping branches, breaking twigs. Nothing  Silence.  I can tell you first hand that nobody could walk down through there in broad daylight, much less at night without a flashlight without snapping branches and making a lot of noise. I spent an additional hour in the camp that night reflecting on what I had heard and trying to attribute it to something that made sense  there was none in all of my experience.  I went to bed and when we got up Friday morning, we decided to hang out at camp to get a start on packing and cleaning as we were closing up camp and leaving on Saturday.  I walked into the woods during daylight where I heard the THWACK noises the night before but found nothing where I expected to see some type of sign.  Needless to say, I didnt tell my wife about those events until Saturday morning as we were getting ready to leave. I still have no idea what it was and it was so dark, I didnt see anything but I can tell you that Ive never heard or experienced anything like that in the many years Ive spent in those woods and the 30+ years Ive owned that camp.

    " I was not in any way aware that these creatures existed in Maine, firstly. I am from Connecticut however I have spent years in desolate oilfields across the U.S. including places like West Texas, the upper Peninsula of Michigan, and the Everglades of Florida. I have a vast knowledge of wildlife as I have always taken an interest to it and spent years IN the forest. My point is, what I experienced this day has shaken me to the core as I know my encounter was nothing \"normal\". <BR><BR>In the Northwoods of Maine in a town called Greenbush, (population 1,400) I purchased 80 acres of wilderness with virgin forest on the back half of the lot. (meaning not even loggers have been there, it''s that desolate.) I had rented an excavator and for this entire day I had been cutting a road through swamp, hills and forests to a high hill I call Hope Hill on the virgin most desolate corner of my land where I want to build my cabin.<BR><BR>I had made it halfway and in the swamp I realized I was out of fuel. I shut down the machine and get out. I step down onto to road and was admiring my work and just relishing in the whole idea of pioneering this new path. <BR><BR>Suddenly about 50 yards into the tree line I hear a bang with a stick on to a tree. Like someone was hitting a wooden bat against a large tree trunk as the percussion was unmistakable... At first I thought \"Oh crap there is a moose\" because it is mating season for them and they are known to ram their antlers against trees to intimidate their foes. <BR><BR>Suddenly, the sound happens again. Now I am certain this is no moose as no branches are breaking, there is movement, no grunts, nothing... Just this wooden thump just through the trees where I can''t see.<BR><BR>I begin walking further away because I''m obviously freaked out. Again, but now 2 knocks... I grab a large branch I had just ripped down with the machine and smacked it against a large tree trunk. Immediately I received a knock in response. I wait around 45 seconds.... I knock again, BANG it knocks right after me again... I knock again 5 seconds later, it responds again right back.... <BR><BR>Now I am shaking because I know what I presume this creature to be. It''s obviously strong because the bang was very loud. Intimidating... I knew there was a certainty I was interacting with Sasqauch. <BR><BR>I went back to my trailer on my qaud which was parked about 200 feet down the trail. I FLEW home. I calm down, now I am questioning reality and am quite, scared I guess. This is my land, I''m only halfway through making the road, these are my thoughts, so I decide to ride back...<BR><BR>I knock again. It responds. I take my phone out. Turn on record on video, I knock, it goes away... Almost as if it knew I was recording. Regardless it was incredibly perplexing. I got back on the quad and went back home knowing for sure what I just experienced was legitimate.<BR><BR>I brought a feather bead string thing from a dream catcher and brought it out there as a gift. It''s been 3 days. I haven''t gone back to see if it''s still there.",

    " About 12 years ago Carla, Cindy and myself, Brian, took a road trip to Brown creek, in Washington state. Went down a dirt road to the end where it met the river. I (Brian) went fishing going down steam while Carla and Cindy walked up river, I walked around a bend I saw a big tree that looked like lightning hit it, but while looking at it better, steam was coming off it, then the top foot and a half turned slowly to where I saw the whites of its eyes, his hair looked like bark, he was squatting, sitting on it heals with knees to its chest, it really looked like a tree broken off. A little one,  a 6 footer, jumped over some rocks and logs and was gone, the big one sitting on its heels was 7-to 8 foot, 3-4 feet wide, It was not scared of me, I ran up river to find the girls, found them and said I wanted to show them something weird, as us three went back, sure enough it was still there. The top turned again looking at us all, approx 25 yards away, we ran as fast as we could to the van in which you could see where this happened but nothing was there.

    " I took a 3 day/2 night solo backpacking trip in Washington state, up the Ape Canyon Trail, around the base of Mt. St. Helens, and through the Muddy River drainage this past July 5th through 7th.   On the  first day of the hike at around 1 pm, as I made my way up the Ape  Canyon Trail, I was surprised to hear a series of \"whooping\" calls, a  series of 5 whoops in a row spaced at intervals of about 30 seconds to  1 minute apart, 5-7 sets over the course 10-15 minutes.  The calls (bwaaahh-bwaaahh-bwaaahh) sounded as if they were emanating  from the bottom of an oil drum, the tone being deep and bodily palpable, even though sounding maybe a mile or more away in the direction of the canyon, and somewhat north of the trail. It struck  me as unnaturally deep and projecting (although not overly loud) and unlike any animal call I had ever heard before (I have hiked and camped in forest and wilderness areas for many years).  I did not hear any  other calls during course of my hike, save what sounded like an  enormous owl hooting near my tent site on the edge of the Muddy River drainage on my 2nd night, at around 2 am.  It was very loud and I was not inclined to get out of my tent for a look-see.  One other thing I found intrigued me though.  On a game trail that slips off of the main trail, just down hill from a ground spring adjacent to the trail 1-2 miles from the trailhead, I came across a couple of downed trees approx. 4-5\" in diameter, twisted or snapped off and laying across the trail in a cross-x pattern. The trees were placed on the trail between the spring and a small meadow farther down the hill.   There were no signs of a lightening strike, no evidence of chopping or sawing was apparent, and the trees looked otherwise healthy and normal, and looked as if they had been pulled over and broken off toward the top of the tree.",

    " When I was about 10 years old my father took me and a friend camping up in Indian Heaven. We parked and then hiked about 3 miles uphill to Lake Wapiki there. It was beautiful mid August and hot. While hiking up to the camp spot I remember having a sense of someone looking at me from the forest. I do have a big imagination though so I didn''t think to much about it.<BR> We arrived at our camp spot and set everything up. We were camping next to a large dried up creek bed and I remember looking at it and following it a little ways down. Picking huckleberries and exploring the rest of the area, I spent the rest of my day just having fun.<BR>  That night, after I and my friend and Dad had gone to bed, we were awakened by a stampede of deer or elk or something. There were at least 10 because it lasted about 20 to 30 seconds and they were running right through our camp. Scared the hell out of me. I remember my Dad getting up and making sure we were all right. Everything was fine and so I slowly fell back asleep.<BR> Next morning I woke up and looked around and it looked like some of our cooking gear was scattered about the camp, probably from the stampede running right through. And then I saw it what makes me believe in Bigfoot. There in the dried creek bed was a huge footprint. And i''m not talking about a human print. Though this foot print could have been made by a man, it was way too big and wide. I estimate a size 20 and it was like 4 to 5 inches across. Huge foot print. Scared me half to death.<BR> I was thinking about it and I think a bigfoot had scared the deer or elk into the stampede. So there is my story about bigfoot. I believe 100% in bigfoot. I know this story isn''t all that. It''s not like I saw him or anything but what i saw made me believe.<BR><BR>   <BR>",

    " I put together a mountain bike trip with a cousin for a weekend in Central Vermont near the town of Plymouth in the Calvin Coolidge state forest. <BR><BR>We decided on a Lean-To shelter called TinkerBrook on the outskirts of the forest near the backside of Killington Peak. One reason for this location was because of the steep topography the area offered for a mountain biker. Also, not to many people visit this shelter according to the Rangers I''ve talked to before due to the hike in and lack of 4x4 access as well. The place offers nothing more than a view of a steep forested ravine. The shelter is right on the edge of this ravine as well.<BR><BR>We travelled up Shrewsbury road which intersects RT100 south of Plymouth and then heads west almost straight up the nearest mountain in a series of switchbacks. We then parked our vehicle on the bend in the road where tinkerbrook shelter trail starts. The trail/road is heavily blocked off by boulders and easy to miss. We packed up the bikes and headed down the old trail/road to the shelter. The shelter is about a 3/4 mile off the forest road we parked the vehicle on.<BR><BR>We set up camp for the night in the shelter and did a look around. The place offered no trails to ride on and the ravine was so steep that you needed to climb out of it using the roots of the trees in it. The place was very isolated.<BR><BR>We headed off to bed around 9:00pm and left a campfire going near the opening of the shelter. A few hours later (12:00am) my cousin woke me up saying that he was hearing and feeling knocks on the shelter. I told him to go back to sleep. Then I heard and felt the noises myself.<BR><BR>The sounds were like something big pushing against the shelter. I thought it could of been a moose or bear and decided to go around back to see. I took a flashlight and went around back within a minute of hearing the noise again. There was nothing there to see.<BR><BR>This continued a few more times during the night until maybe 3:00am. I felt the bumping sounds near my side of the shelter on occasion. We didn''t get much sleep and at one point I even pulled all the firewood close to the opening to keep a large fire going.<BR><BR>In the morning we looked for any damage to the shelter and found nothing. We also looked around for any sign on the ground (footprints, loose rocks, scrapes and hoofmarks) but found nothing.<BR><BR>We decided not to stay another night and headed out. <BR><BR>",

    " I research mountain lions in NH, but I was caring for my mother and hadn''t gotten out since Christmas Day, 2014. On 5/24/15 I decided to just go for a walk, no research. I did a Meet-up with someone who walked much faster than me. She left me at the power line. I was way downhill, but was determined to at least make it to the power line. <BR>I did, but when I turned back to go down to the car, I saw two huge prints near a tree by the trail. When I got to them, the heels were 3-4 inches deep in the soil and leaves. They touched and the toes went out and away from each other like a duck''s feet. They seemed to be 15 inches long, but it was hard to tell with all the leaves, unevenness, grass, etc. I took photos and measurements (even on a walk I take a camera and tape measure). <BR><BR>It was interesting as hiding by that tree the Futures Trail went right past the tree, above was the power line and behind the tree was the park road, so that it was an advantageous hunting spot as animals coming from six different directions could easily be hunted down.<BR><BR>Going back to the car, I saw two more tracks to the right of the trail. One was about 10 inches. The other seemed to be 15 inches, but with a 10 inch track inside it. The toes were 5 inches across for the three toes that were embedded in the bank. The other toes were over the hardened trail. There was also a 5x6 inch parallelogram shape. I kick myself now as I didn''t take a photo. <BR><BR>Later I saw a knuckle-walking gorilla on TV and thought, \"That''s what that was!\" It was a knuckle print and also was very deep. <BR><BR>At the bottom I asked the ranger to do a casting and he said I could instead, so I bought plaster of Paris. It wasn''t enough. I had to go back several days later (rain). <BR><BR>The casts are awful. There were too many leaves, the toes broke off, etc. <BR><BR>The interesting part was that the park ranger acknowledged the report with a \"Yeah, we get lots of reports of bigfoots, but we try to keep it on the down low.\" <BR><BR>When I asked him about mountain lion sightings, he seemed scared and said, \"You think there are mountain lions up there?\"<BR>It was odd that bigfoot was \"normal\" and mountain lions were \"strange\"!<BR><BR>When I came back, I heard from someone else that this same ranger had been followed down the hill by something he nicknamed Roy. He was hoping it was a bigfoot and not a lion. Part of his job is to clear the trails and make sure everyone is off the mountain. That night it got dark, and he was also \"helped\" off the mountain, though \"it\" always stayed the same distance behind him.",

I wanted to be sure I had not imagined it.<BR><BR>Very quickly she said, \"I don''t know what it was but it was real big, maybe eight feet tall, hairy and crossed the road in two steps.\"<BR><BR>She saw the same thing I did.

    " Nov. 1984 between 12:00& 1:00AM The night my niece was born.There was a snow storm, my brother-in-law had a custom car and wanted to go home to milton to switch to his older car because of the sudden snow. My husband, brother-in-law, nephew 3yrs old & myself, drove from milton, we were headed to my house in Winooski. we got as far as Clochester when the snow got real bad and the car slid into a ditch,my newphew began to cry&scream, so we flaged down a truck to bring me&my nephew to my house to call a tow truck. I Left my husband&BROTHER-IN-LAW in Colchester. My husband said while they were waiting they started to hear noises in the woods, like trees breaking,than they heard something that was coming in thier dirction but the it was stomping on two legs they could breaking trees,coming closer,my husband is a hunter and he said you could tell it was walking on two legs they backed away from the side of the road to the other, couldnt run because the road was to slippery <BR>and they only had on sneakers. meanwhile it kept on getting closer, it was starting to part the trees when the tow truck came and they heard it running back into the woods breaking every thing in its path My husband was very scared , they both were &told me what had happened. I HALF believed them.<BR>The next day I drove threw the same place & looked around as I drove I saw fields and woods and thought that it looked to peaceful and really thought they were nuts. I HAD TO PICK UP MY HUSBAND IN MILTON. I had my daughters with me 10 and 13, I WAS PREGNANT at that time, anyway I got to Milton ,latter that night we headed back to Winooski, well wouldnt you know it, it started to snow realy hard like the night before and it was 12:00am. <BR><BR>We started to go threw the same spot as the night before and I started to tell my husband about me looking around earlier and that there was nothing ...... When there it was, it just crossed the road and started to go up a hill ,it was staring at us with one  foot on a wire fence holding the wire down with its arm and just staring at us, it was not brown but white with yellow dirty streaks and his eyes, oh how they scared me, they were reflecting a yellow/amber color  like the yellow on causion lights, huge man, it was at least 10 ft. tall arms very long ,his fur was long, on his face the only flesh part that didnt have fur was his eyes,upper cheeks. My husband started to slow down to get a better look, thats when I freaked out and started to hit my husband because I was so scared & my girls were screaming so we kept on going I just kept on thinking about its eyes and was afraid so we wandered if they know its there and we dont want to get shot looking. <BR>",

We have had a bear here by the deck, so I know what bears look like standing up to the reach feeder. <BR><BR>It was sunny day. My small Chihuahua mix was out front in her cage. She was barking so I walked out to front deck and looked towards dirt road where she was looking. We sit back approx.125ft from the road. <BR><BR>I saw a very black humanoid shape walking on two legs go past our driveway. It was half bent over then straightened up. It had  longs arms swinging. The head was turned away & appeared to have very short neck & roundish head from that angle. <BR><BR>I said to myself, \"That looks like a chimp!\". I watched for it for approx.12 seconds until it disappeared behind trees going east on road.  There are spots that I can see thru the trees to the neighbors drive, so I was looking for it to either go up the drive or continue on road. When it did not, I walked out to end of drive, approx. 200 ft. ( w/ my air horn). There was nothing on the road for some distance.<BR><BR>Later in day I went out to that area with my small dog. She refused to even walk and was trembling. This is the same dog that almost went thru a screen door to attack the bear by our feeder a few weeks ago. I noticed an area of bent weeds that would have been where the creature had exited our woods, going into a small ditch then back up to get onto road before walking past our drive. On the roadside, in the direction I saw it going,  there were 3 barefoot heel depressions w/ faint toe marks approx. 12 inches long.  The area was dry with fine gravel so not a clear print.<BR><BR>The week before, I had heard twigs snapping & weeds moving behind my fenced garden. This approx. 40 ft from the front porch where I often sit. The dog barked. The noise stopped then started again, so I fired off my air horn which I always have near after an encouter with a large coy-wolf.<BR><BR>The cabin sits about 100ft  above the N.

    "There was a time when I was delivering newspapers very early in the morning. I took a shortcut down a path through some woods and I could barely see anything. I came around a corner in the path and got scared because I saw what I thought was some large dark person laying down next to the path taking a rest and looking at me. I could not discern any features and could not tell if it was a log or a person, but something made me stop and stare. I kept blinking trying to get the nerve to get closer, but I could not see clearly enough. I went back the way I came. Since this was a path I used regularly I couldn''t remember if a log was there or what that could have been. This might not be worth mentioning.",

    " My friend and I were out late on a saturday night visiting some girls.  We didn''t have a car and we had walked about 7 or 8 miles to arrive.  We were both on the JV soccer team at our highschool and even though the season was over we were in very good shape.  For this reason we jogged maybe half the trip which got us there in time for saturday night live.  We stayed long enough for me to watch SNL with one girl and my friend to spend some private time with his beau.  It got to be late and we knew we had a long trip back to his place.<BR><BR>I felt fine and wanted to leave after awkwardly watching TV with this girl.  Getting to this location was easy because it was mostly downhill, but getting back was going to take longer. We were still in good shape so we jogged most of the way back up the long hill on Town Hill Rd.(219) near Bakersville, but in New Hartford, CT.<BR><BR>It was a crisp night without much moonlight. We had grown comfortable jogging side by side in the middle of the road.  Since it was so late nobody was out driving and we set a consistent pace for about 2 hours.  We finally made it to the top of the long hill where Route 219 flattens out.  We were casually jogging in the middle of the road past houses and an occasional farm when we heard a bad sound.<BR><BR>It made us stop dead in our tracks and we were both frightened.  It came from the left of the road perhaps behind a farm and a fair distance away.  I distinctly remember turning my head as the sound swept from left to right and thinking to myself that is a big sound.<BR><BR>I would like to comment on the sound.  I have spent alot of time in the woods of Connecticut and was familiar with sounds from area wildlife including birds, squirrels, coyotes, dogs etc.  I immediately asked my friend \"What the f!$# was that?\"  He responded that he did not know.  From the left, the sound was a cry that sounded like a cross between a baby and a woman screaming bloody murder that started very high, held for a number of seconds, and then came down in pitch.  When it got lower it changed into a broken cackle that made the echoes more pronounced.  It was very disturbing and unlike anything we had ever heard.  I asked my friend if he wanted to stay and check it out but he was very disturbed and did not want to hang around.  It was a bad sound that you don''t want to hear in the middle of night.  We stood there for a few moments confused and scared, and decided to get going.<BR><BR>We continued jogging for another hour discussing along the way what it could be.  Eventually we became more relaxed and the conversation moved onto other things like the events earlier in the evening.  Things were fine again and we were making good progress over a few more miles when we heard the sound again, this time on the right side of the road and closer.<BR><BR>Again it was a blood curdling scream that held for a few seconds, slowly descended in pitch and cackled at the end, but on the other side of the road and closer.  We were now more scared and both had the feeling we were being followed or tracked.    I turned to my friend and said pointedly that we might not get another chance like this again and I grabbed his arm.  In panic he cocked his right arm back and said some expletives to the extent that if I did not let go he would lay me out flat right there.  He sprinted down the road without me and I had no choice but to follow him since I lost sight of him in the dark.  I caught up with him soon enough and we quietly jogged the remainder of the distance to his house though we were shaky.<BR><BR>For years he was not open to talking about what we heard and he apologized for threatening me and leaving me standing there.  When it was discussed we never came to a decision about what it was.<BR><BR>A few years ago I came across the BFRO website and started reading reports.  I listened to a few audio recordings from OHIO but nothing clicked until I read reports of screams.  The recordings on the site are like moans and long whoops, but some reports describe a more stressed vocalization that puts the listeners instantly into panic- this is what we heard.  Its a really really bad sound that is confusing because it sounds sort of familiar, but is so extreme its difficult to describe.  The reports I have read that describe the scream include hunters and military folks who pretty much bolt when they hear it.<BR><BR>Since this happened I have worked professionally in molecular genetics and neurobiology at UCONN and Yale University.  I have also had careers in the financial industry as a quantitative analyst, and as a sound designer and audio engineer to the musical instrument industry.<BR><BR>Whatever made the sound was able to project over a great distance, and kept up with us over enough miles to convince us we were being stalked.  I cannot say for sure what made the sound, but based on: other credible reports in the BFRO database, the similarity to other screams and our own responses, a sasquatch is my best candidate without invoking the supernatural which I personally would never do.<BR><BR>Looking in the database for reports from Connecticut, the only one I found was surprisingly in the same County - Litchfield.",

    "   This sighting happened when I was a young boy of about seven or eight years of age. It was a cloudy fall day. I was playing near a window in a second story farm house when something caught my eye. I watched as a hairy nine-foot creature walked up hill across the front yard. It had a huge stride, as if it were in a hurry. It kept looking back as it walked with its long swinging arms. When it turned its head it had to also turn its shoulders to be able to look at a 90-degree angle. I stood watching it walk along when it apeared to look up and make eye contact with me for only a second. It never broke its stride. It''s eyes glowed like a raccoon or a cat at night when light is shined in their eyes. What frightened me was that it was still daylight. I didn''t get really freaked until it disapeared around the side of the house. That''s when I ran in to the kitchen were my parents were playing cards with another couple. I tried to get their attention but they didn''t have time for a whiny kid who wanted a cookie or candy. It wasn''t until they escorted me out the front door and slammed it in my face that they figured out something was wrong: There was no way I was going to hang around out side with a monster in the area. I flipped out --screaming, beating,kicking the door  and crying for them to let me in. It was only a couple or three seconds and they knew something was terrible wrong. They let me in and I explained what I had just seen through tears. My father and his friend went outside to look around, probably thinking they would find a loose cow. I''ll never forget the look on their faces when they saw the foot prints that dwarfed their own. My dad''s friend was a tall man of around six foot two or three. When he stretched his legs to step from one foot print to another it was next to impossible. Their disbelief had turned to fear. They did however want to follow the tracks that went across a field that had been plowed recently. I freaked out again. They seemed to understand this time. They decided that going in a car would be better. We drove down a road a short distance, found were it crossed and went on up a hill. The tracks disapeared and that seemed fine with everyone.  ",

    " There is a small pond located in the wildlife management area in Harwinton. I have frequently visited this place throughout my youth, and adulthood to fish, camp, hike, bike, and hunt.<BR>The pond is spring fed, and is located in a flood conroll area. A town built dam at one end helps contoll the water level, but at the time of the incident the dam was poorly built.<BR>In late summer the water level in the pond would drop drastically, and create a higher concenration of fish. The best time to go fishing was at night when temps. were cooler.<BR>On this one particular night I decided to go moonlight topwater bassi''n alone. I parked my car at the entance gate around 9:00pm, and proceeded on foot down the service road. The moonlight was intense, and afforded me the luxury of saving my flashlight batteries for most of the treck. The trip from the road to the pond is approx. 3/4 of a mile, and takes you through several fields wich are cut in the summer.On the way i startled some deer that were around a salt lick, they ran off in the opposite direction of the pond.<BR>I walked through the final field, and over a stone wall, onto a path that leads directly to the spot on the pond where i wanted to fish.The area from the stone wall to the pond is wooded, and recquired use of the flashlight.<BR>The path, and woodline end in an area of land that juts out into the pond, forming a point. Due to the low water level, it was another 50 yds. walk to get to the waters edge. I fished off of a couple of rocks that jutted out even further.<BR>I had been fishing for approximately an hour, and havig some luck. The moon was full, and almost directly overhead. I was out in the wide open, and could see very well all around the shoreline. The woodline around the pond was spaced from the water at least 30yards plus in all directions. The moonlight did not penetrate into the woods, and so I could not see into them. I felt as though I were on center stage to anything that might be in the woods wathing me. All of a sudden out of nowhere a loud and deep sound eminated direclty from the woodline where I had entered the area. My knees went weak, and I nearly fell off the rocks. I turned to face the area in a ducking position trying to see what it was. The sound was again repeated after a short pause, and then nothin. I pointed my flashlight in the direction of the sound,but it was too far and too weak, not even an eyeshine. This was all that I heard.<BR>The sounds were as follows: WWRRUUMMMPFSFSFSFSSS!!-twice in succession, then a short pause (10 sec.) followed by the same WWRRUUMMMPFSFSFSSS!!-Twice in succession.<BR>The sounds were deep, and came from something large, (200+lbs.) They echoed across the pond! They were definitely directed at me, something was letting me know it was there.<BR>I found it odd that pryor to and after, there were no sounds of walking in the woods. Watever this was made a stealthy approach, and exit. I never heard anything again.<BR>I stayed and fished nervously for another hour, and left the area scared but without incident.<BR> <BR>",

    " I have a couple of incidents to report, both took place near Bethel, CT at the property I owned/lived on at the time. <BR><BR>These incidents took place in May of 2013 if I recall correctly. I lived set back in the woods up a long driveway not completely surrounded by forest but mostly. There were a couple houses a hundred or more feet away but I was pretty isolated. <BR><BR>I pulled up to my house in front of my garage. I was facing a small chunk of woods behind an old stone wall that was very brushy and bushy and had a lot of big rocks and uneven ground and it all went slightly up hill. I got out of the car with my 4 and a half month old German Shepherd and she uncharacteristically ran away from me toward the aforementioned stone wall barking very aggressively like a full grown Shepherd in protection mode. I was curious what sort of creature could get her to react like that so I took my flashlight out of the car and shined it in the brush but it was so heavy all I could see was a dark shadow moving about 20 ft or so ahead of me very slowly, sounding almost bipedal, like it wasn''t very afraid but was keeping its distance. Finally it got to somewhat of a clearing but was crouching and hiding behind a tree poking its head out from behind repeatedly. <BR><BR>I wondered what dark bulky figure could have bright reddish orange eyes and move from crouching to standing relatively tall so I initially figured it must have been a black bear and I called my dog inside and went about my business. <BR><BR>The very next night I pulled into the same spot and I had a friend with me and we got out of the car and we both heard a large bellowing roar a couple times and it sounded like it was in the area I saw the \"bear\" the night before. He asked me \"what the f--- is that\" and I said it must have been what I assumed was the bear I encountered the night before. It wasn''t until a few months later when I was watching some videos on sasquatch encounters did I realize what I really saw. Not only that but black bears don''t roar. The roar I heard sounded like vocalization recordings of angry sasquatch and the movements of the head and color of the eyes were exactly as anyone who encountered them had reported. <BR><BR> According to another sasquatch reporting site there was a sighting in the late 70s in the town next to Bethel (Danbury) and a cast was taken of prints. <BR><BR>I firmly believe it was a sasquatch I encountered.",

    " This sighting happened in mid October 1971 in Fairfield, New Jersey.  It was a Saturday, sometime around noon.  <BR><BR>At the time I was 15 and my friend was 16.  We were walking throught a area that is primarily brushy woods, but alot of wet land with only clumps of  tall grass. We were walking in a westerly direction along a feeder stream that fed into the Passic River.  The Passic River is about 1/2 mile north of where we were. The area is quite flat.  The areas on the imediate left and right of the feeder stream had little brush.                <BR><BR>It was partly cloudy, and we were wearing light jackets.  From a distance of aproximetly 75 yards we observed 4 creatures.  The largest was standing on the south side of the stream.  It appeared to be about 8 feet tall, very long arms that went almost to the knees.  Very powerfully built, barrel chested, very wide shoulders.  the head seemed to have a rounded \"peak\".  The color of all 4 was black, the faces seemed somewhat lighter in color, but not white.  The second one was sitting on the ground, the third was lying on the stream bank, and the last was standing in the middle of the stream.  <BR><BR>We observed them for a few minutes.  They also observed us.  We discussed it and decided to run.  We ran back east for a bit until we came to a clear cut for power lines that ran north & south.  We ran south along the clear cut for aproximetly 1/4 mile until we came to Route 80.  <BR><BR>We went home.  The only people we told were our parents.  At no time did we feel threatened by the creatures.  We were used to being in the woods and knew the local fauna.  We both agreed these were not people or bears.

    " April 29 2006 about 630pm I just left the Livingston mall and was heading home but got all turned about since I don''t go up that way very often. Anyhow I was figuring that I was north of rt 78 and just kind of \"Lewis and Clarked\" it toward home via the mirror compass in my car and made the first left southbound that I could once I realized I was heading west and didn''t recognize any landmarks. <BR><BR>I turn down this road and notice some construction equipment not far off into the trees on the right side of the road. I was driving slower than normal being unfarmiliar with the area and since I kept peeking at the compass to make sure I was still southbound (looking back it must have been overcast since I would have just used the location of the sun as a reference to direction).<BR>As I was driving along I caught movement out of the corner of my eye and saw a young deer (judging by size) bolt out of the trees across the road from left to right about 100-200 feet in front of my car. I just took my foot off the gas and didn''t need to brake, then I looked left for followers and saw what appeard to be a hunter in a dark colored ghillie suit burst from the trees after the deer. I couldnt make out any details of the face feet or hands but he/it was only around 6 feet tall or so and I''d estimate the low 200lb range but was unusually fast especially for someone dressed like that. The second thought in my head since I fish and shoot a bit was that it couldn''t possibly be legal to hunt around that area since its fairly close to residential zones. Then I noticed that the hunter had no weapons in his hands. I got up to the spot where they crossed and looked right and noticed that the biped (hunter) actually closed ground on the deer and was still in pursuit. I don''t know if the deer stopped to look back at some point as they some times do but this thing was in a full tilt sprint over what I would assume to be uneven ground and didn''t stumble once. I didn''t hear or smell anything since I had my roof up and AC & radio on at the time. All of this happened I would estimate in less than 20 seconds total.",

    " I''m reporting this approximately 10 years after the fact.  My wife had asked me to re-tell my story to her this morning and that is what prompted us to stumble across this web site.  <BR><BR>Late Fall 1997 (or possibly 1996).  I was coming out of my apartment''s laundry facility, which is a seperate building not connected to the actual apartment buildings.  I must have heard something because I looked to my right and there it was, about 20 feet away.  The creture was about 5.5 to 6 feet tall. I''d guess it was aroung 200 lbs. There was no odor and it made no sound.  I saw it as it was rooting through a garbage dumpster.  In a matter of seconds my brain went through a kind of checklist to try to rationalize what I was seeing.  But it was not a bear, it was too slim in relation to its height.  It also moved in a way that was very human.  It was nighttime but there was a parking lot light on overhead.  I could see hair that was brown and about 4-7 inches in length. Unfortunately, primative survival instict and adreneline took over.  I bolted toward my apartment, running so fast that I lost my footing as I was going through a dip in the terrain.  I landed arms first and slid across a gravel covered road.  As I got to my feet I looked over my shoulder to see that it too had run and was about 200 feet from where we had met.<BR><BR>I''m certain it was not an animal that is commonly known to people.  It was humanoid in appearence and movement.  The way it stopped what it was doing, turned its head and looked at me was freaky. Because of shadows I couldn''t get a look at its face.  The incident didn''t change my life or anything.  I hardly ever think about it...unless I look at my elbow.  I scraped it really bad when I fell running, and have a scar to this day.  When I first told this story to my wife she was very taken aback because she knows that I am a very rational and analytic person.  ",

    " On April 15, 2011 my sons and I were camping at Mahlon Dickerson Reservation near Jefferson Township, NJ. The temperature was approximately 52 degrees and the day was overcast. At around 3 PM the three of us struck out from our campsite directly into the timber. There was no overgrowth and the trees were still bare. This is the reason we didnt take any of the marked trails in the area. The terrain is very rocky and over the next hour we hiked and climbed. Circling back into the camp area we emerged at the far end and headed toward the road that runs the length of the campsite.<BR><BR>From our position on the road, immediately to our right would be the beginning of a two-way trail. The lower trail heads off and skirts the bottom of the mountain while the upper trail heads up it. As we got to the road I looked over my right shoulder (Why I did this I still do not know. In other words, there was no noise that I heard or any other reason I can think of that made me turn around). There, at the beginning of the upper trail was a tall bulky black figure. It moved from right to left. Its arms were long and swung in large motions as it walked. The head was dome shaped and very close to the shoulders. In fact, it seemed that it would have had to turn its entire body to look in any direction other than straight ahead.  It walked out of site rather quickly. <BR><BR>I was completely caught off guard when I saw it. My very first thought was why is this guy walking up the trail wearing black from head to toe? Thats when it hit me that no one would. Sure there are hikers and mountain bikers on the trails but not at this time of year during a work day. In fact, we had spent the previous night here and were the only campers on the grounds. There had been no visitors to the grounds the entire day save one woman who came to walk her small dog. The next thought that ran through my mind was how big it was. It did not appear to be exceptionally tall (not eight feet tall anyway) but the sheer girth of the thing was impressive. It seemed to me that it could have wrestled a bear and easily won. <BR><BR>I have to admit that it took me a few seconds to gather my wits once it had moved out of sight. Once I did I told the boys to stay behind me and we moved up to where I had seen it. Once we reached the area I looked to the right where I had first seen it come into view and got another small surprise. I had thought it was walking along the upper trail when I first spotted it. However, that trail began where I had first seen it. The direction it came from was an off trail wooded area. We did follow the trail for about ten minutes but I decided to abandon it and head back to camp when the kids got spooked. On the way back I had my 12 year old, 155lbs, 56 son stand at the top of the trail where I had first seen the thing while I went back to my original spot where I first saw it. Whatever I saw that day was an easy 12 taller and three times bigger around than my son. <BR><BR>Those are the facts. Now, I have to add that my impression of this thing was one of curiosity. I had been having a feeling, not an overwhelming feeling but a feeling none the less, that as we hiked off trail that day we were being watched. I never felt threatened or perceived any danger or I certainly would have moved my boys right out of there. It seems to me that it had been watching us and once we had left its area and gotten back to ours it was more than happy to move on its way. <BR><BR>",

Took one step from the center of my lane and with one step, not a run, was over the sideline and into the woods. I was about 19 at the time. No one believes me to this day.

    " We were at Octoberfest in October 1998 at Great Gorge in Vernon NJ.  We were out on the back deck which boarders the mountains and the golf course.  My brother in law and sister with me.  Out of the corner of my eye I saw an approximately 7 1/2 - 8 foot large figure that walked with a long steady gate,  with long arms and a thick chest.  It walked steadily down the mountain side glancing at us and continuing to walk.  We all looked at each other before running inside.  We all saw the exact same thing.  ",

    " I had some strange experiences in my childhood. A friend from up the street, she and I would walk through the woods. There was a path that went in a big circle where the older neighborhood kids would ride dirt bikes. It was about a mile around, I''d say. When we''d get about 2/3 the way around this ''circle'' we''d hear single short whistles and small stones would be tossed near us. We thought it was the neighborhood kids, so kind of ignored it, but this would happen every time we walked around in this section of the woods. About 3/4 the way around the circle, we saw some matted down dry grass, that looked like a bedding area. Also, some strange footprints as well in the muddy areas. They were huge footprints and the toes seemed almost rectangular in the dried footprints. We''d also smell a wet dog type smell in this area. The last time I was in that section of the woods was 1975/1976. <BR><BR>A couple other times, I''d go with a friend to the Howell/Farmingdale area. We''d walk back to an abandoned house in the woods and drink a couple beers. We''d hear noises and saw some of the same size footprints that the neighbor and I had seen in the woods behind my neighborhood. <BR><BR>Fast forward 5 years or so, a boyfriend and I were smoking cigarettes in the school field by the house I grew up in. It was Fall, just at dusk, probably 6pm-ish. I happened to look up and look across the school field and saw this HUGE shadow standing on a slightly raised hill across the school field, by another neighborhood...I stared at that figure for a minute thinking that person sure has long arms, It was probably 60 feet away from us at that time. I stared a minute more and suddenly I could see that figure crystal clear as it bolted across the school field towards us. As it got closer I could see reddish brown shaggy fur on this huge man/ape type creature. It ran towards us silently, but with huge strides, as it came closer and closer. All I could do was yell, \"RUN!\" and we ran through a neighbor''s yard and back to my house. I told my mom what happened and she said we shouldn''t have been in the school field when it was getting dark...I was petrified and the next day my boyfriend and one of his friends went back to look for this thing, but we never found it again. I recently talked to my son about this incident and wrote it out for him, as I wanted my story documented. I still to this day get goosebumps every time I talk about it. ",

    " First I want it to be clear that I am very skeptical that what I witnessed was anything out of the ordinary. I say this for reasons I will explain in a moment. Nonetheless, I am reporting this incident because even though I am skeptical, it remains possible that I did observe something extraordinary and if that is so then perhaps others did or will. So I offer this report as a possible sighting and to hopefully corroborate any other reports that you may receive involving the same area. Any such additional reports would of course then lend more credence to mine.<BR><BR>Also I would like to indicate that I firmly believe in the existence of sasquatch and have had an ardent interest in this mystery since I was around 12. My interest was reinvigorated a year or so ago when I found the BFRO website. I  grew up in the northwest portion of New Jersey, which is an area of predominately deciduous forest with sporadic coniferous areas as well. There are open pastures as well as rugged mountainous terrain there.   An example   being the Kittatinny Ridge that runs through Sussex County and contains a portion of the Appalachian Trail. So while I don''t believe this area offers the optimal environmental characteristics to sustain or attract a constant sasquatch population, I do think (as with many other species) that a transient sasquatch may very well wander into this area periodically (from areas west or north) and perhaps remain for an extended period of time. I think the reports of sightings from this area over the last 30 years or so pretty much indicate this type of pattern. <BR><BR>So ever since my renewed interest began, I have made a point of being much more observant of my surroundings especially when driving through those types of areas I mentioned above. I should also note that I am in law enforcement and I have a keen interest in most matters of science. I accept the need for a scientific approach to investigating this and other type of phenomena and that belief is what has instilled part of the skepticism of my \"sighting\". That and the fact that my incident provides minimal information from an investigatory stand point. Also, while I indicated earlier that I felt the terrain and environment of this area could offer refuge to a transient creature, the amount of development and activity, especially where my incident occurred says otherwise. But with that said, here''s what I saw.<BR><BR> On this day I was really attempting to look beyond the road edge and peer into the woods or fields as I drove past. <BR>There is a small creek (Burnt Meadow Brook)that runs perpendicular from the roadway into that area. As I looked back about 200-250 yards or so I observed what seemed to be a human like shape standing and appearing to be looking down either at the ground or into the water (I couldn''t tell from my vantage point). It was dark brown to black in color and for the short 4-5 seconds I observed it there was no apparent movement. My best guess would be that it was between six and seven feet in height. My perception was that this \"thing\" was facing opposite of my direction of travel and that I was viewing its right side. The distance was too great to observe any fine detail or to even determine if it wasn''t just an old tree trunk.  However, upon passing that location on subsequent days, it was no longer present. It''s possible that it was a person, but I am pretty confident it was not based on the appearance and the relative inaccessibility of the location. Due to the distance, I was basically looking at a silhouette and thus unable to note any specific anatomical features. <BR><BR>I questioned the probability of a sasquatch venturing into this particular area considering it was during daylight hours and the location is right off a major interstate and this occurred during the peak of the morning rush. Also, the area I described is on the south side of the highway, perhaps 300-400 yards from the edge of a large commercial/retail/residential area. I should note however, that the area on the opposite (north) side of the road is predominately woods and is basically the southern edge of Green Pond Mountain which, being sparsely inhabited and heavily wooded, could offer a person or animal the ability to travel northward and westward for miles unseen. This tract of forested, relatively undeveloped land extends continuously into Pennsylvania and New York State. So I guess my implication is that if this was an animal, it most likely approached from the north side.  I have since noticed that there is a drainage culvert (to accommodate the creek mentioned earlier) which appears to run under the highway connecting the north and south sides. I do not know the diameter of this culvert however. <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>",
    :environment
    "Approaching the location, there is a small wooded tract which ends at the edge of a marshy, wetlands area. A small creek (Burnt Meadow Brook)runs through it which consists of marsh type grass, low brush and some sporadic trees. Continuing east the area remains wetlands with a predominance of tall reeds before transitioning back to a wooded terrain. The entire marsh area is perhaps 200-250 yards wide and perhaps 1/4 mile deep before ending at the commercial area.",

    " My friend and I wanted to go fishing at bear pond so we left my house at about 6 pm. We went topwater fishing because of the approaching sunset. We went in a canoe and fished along the edge of the entire pond.  It started to get too dark to cast accurately considering all of the trees along the edge overhang the water. We decided to start heading to the docking area to go home. By now it was completely dark and there are no houses in the back part of the pond just woods and rivers and some preety steep hills that go on forever.We were at a complete stop in the canoe between the mainland and an island when all of a sudden we both heard a loud scream comming from the mainland up on a hill. It sounded like a mix between a young girl screaming and a weard bird like sound.We both looked at each other and said \"What the hell was that\".Again it happened and again. Just as the sound stopped something started to RUN in the mainland woods about 50 yards from us.The sound was very loud like crashing and running. <BR><BR>Something was watching us very quietly because we had passed that area along the edge of the water about 20 minutes earlier.  Anyway, this thing was definitely on two legs running towards the screaming sound on the hill. It must have ran 100 feet in 7 seconds. I must tell you that there was a new moon that night so it was pitch black out. When the thing was running it broke sticks and branches and was very loud almost running urgently and clumsily. At that point it stopped completely by the screaming sound we heard seconds ago. My friend and I both sat there stunned in the canoe; our eyes looking toward the direction of where the running stopped. We sat there for almost an hour listening but we only heard small twigs breaking nothing else. We eventually left but we both know what it was. <BR><BR>We are both in our mid 20''s and are avid outdoorsman and know that whatever we heard was not a bear or deer.",

    " NJ:2AM/;Summer morning:1977:Owassa Rd:Sussex Cty<BR><BR>While traveling back from the Dover Station and returning to Camp Kiamesha a group of counselors encountered a large creature as it crossed the road in about 3 steps, it stood about 7 feet tall and as it crossed the road, it turned and our headlights caught its shape and eyes. It had crossed between us and another car, it was at least 3 foot higher than the car in front of us.<BR><BR>From the low area to the left to the mountain area on the right. I was driving that van, I slammed on the brakes and asked everyone if they saw what I had seen, they did. I then got out with a flash light and another friend to investigate. The ground on the right where it had gone into was loose dirt and rocky area but no foot prints were found and the creature was gone. We waited there for some time, even stopped a car traveling in the same direction for help, but they only stayed long enough for us to say what we had seen and sped off.<BR><BR>When we reached the camp we called the NJ State Police to report our find, but they wouldn''t believe us.<BR><BR>In March of 1978 I led a BF hunt on Mount Paradise near Crandon Lake and found footprints in the snow.<BR><BR>Its been 34 years since this incident and it still seems like yesterday.

    " My brother and I camped overnight in High Point State Park, New Jersey, the other night. Driving around the park, the camping sites were labeled with numbers. We wanted to set up in a place as far away as we could from the other people. I myself, have known the existence of Sasquatch to be real for quite some time. Not from a personal experience which was yet to come, but because of watching so many people tell their stories of encounters, and just seeing the genuine fright and truthfulness in their eyes when they tell their stories. My brother however, always laughed at the subject of Bigfoot, and was a complete skeptic. So, my brother and I has set up camp on the edge of what I''m assuming was the only lake in the park. We walked through the forest in the daytime, and indeed found many peculiar structures and tree breaks I had seen before on Bigfoot TV shows. As night fell, we made a fire, and watched the numerous stars reveal themselves as the night got darker. Around 12 o''clock at night I went over to a rock right by the edge of the lake and looked up at the stars, while my brother tended the fire. I''m an astronomy fan, so before I knew it I had been sitting there for two hours when I checked my phone and it said it was nearing 2 in the morning. Just then my phone ran out of battery. While sitting on the rock, I began to feel a weird sensation that someone or something was watching me, I checked to see if it was my brother but he was staring into the fire. I dismissed this feeling and told myself I had just brought it on myself. I looked back up at the stars and got lost in some train of thought when all of the sudden, something made a very loud noise that could only be described as a very large man exhaling aggressively towards me. I jumped up and ran to my brother, and we heard the thing walk towards the forest, all the while breaking branches and continuing to make the same aggressive noise I heard so close to me. It got quiet, and my brother and I were standing looking in the direction where all the noise had came from when it made the noise again. Now, I don''t speak Sasquatch but that thing was telling us to get the heck out of there. I don''t get scared easily at all, and I was shaking like I never had before. I felt so much negative energy and decided I was too scared to stay outside, so we went to the car and sat inside, praying whatever made that noise didn''t come back. My brother described the sound as sounding like someone ripping a tent. Whatever the noise was, absolutely no common animal could have made it. After a sleepless night, when it got light out again around 5:30, we built up the courage to go back where we heard the noise to see if there were any indications of what made it. And when we got there, I was shocked. There was a makeshift bed made from giant leaves that was fit for a very large creature. I could see the exact spot where the thing that had made the noise was watching me, and where it walked away, as there was a clear path of flattened grass and plants leading up the forest. The area was wet and muddy, and indeed there were footprints. But, as I was taking pictures the path leading from the bed to the upper forest, it happened again. The thing made the same exact noise, this time it was so close, I nearly fell. We ran back to our campsite and listened. But nothing made a sound. We stayed there for about 30 minutes until I decided to go back and see if there were fresh prints or anything I could take back as proof. I took more pictures, and i was standing on the trail leading back to our campsite looking at the pictures I had taken when again, the thing made the same noise! This time it was on the side of me that I would have to run past it to get back to the campsite. As soon as I heard it, it felt like my heart literally dropped and my legs became wobbly, but I summed up my courage and once again ran back to the campsite in fear. It was only about 10 seconds away, and when I got there my brother was standing there wide eyed asking if I had heard the noise. Whatever it was, it was not happy and we heard it walk up into the forest breaking branches and exhaling aggressively as it headed deeper into the forest. At this point my brother wanted to get the heck out of there, but I needed to see it. I went up to the road right before the forest where we had heard it go in, and looked around, but saw nothing. I was so confused on how the heck it ever got so close to me without me seeing or hearing it walk at all. While I was walking on the road, I saw my brother walk up from the campsite looking around. When he spotted me, he sighed in relief and told me he though I was getting attacked because he heard a bunch of human like screams coming from the forest. I walked towards where he was and started to hear them too, but by the time I reached him the screams started to sound like some kind of weird chatter. My brother, the skeptic, was so scared he told me were packing up and leaving right away. I have no doubt in my mind that we just happened to pick a campsite right next to where a Sasquatch was sleeping, and he was just not happy about that. I know what we heard was a Sasquatch. My brother entered a skeptic, but left a full believer in Bigfoot. ",

When I got back in my car, I noticed someone standing behind the very high brush, 7-8 feet tall at least because I could see its complete head over the bushes. It just stood there watching us. Reddish-brown, orangutan colored hair, covered it''s head. It was very human-like and I could tell that it was standing upright. I blinked a million times to try and really focus as much as I could, paying attention to detail. I couldn''t make out the face for certain as it was covered in hair. When we started to drive, it immediately took off in the opposite direction as to not confront us. It seemed to be frightened. At this point I said out loud, WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT?

We were heading towards the hawk lookout when I began to hear what sounded like wood knocks coming from behind us to the east. I decided to knock back to see what would happen. I had my Panasonic Digital IC recorder model RR-US360 with me. I knocked while my wife recorded. This happened at approximately 1:30 PM in the afternoon. I have been hiking this area for a few months now and have come across some interesting stick structures. I later found out from a neighbor that lived in the area his entire life that there are caves and mines on the side where the knocks were coming from. Could it be Sasquatch? I do not know for sure, but I cannot think of anything else making these wood knocks and stick structures.",

It got very interesting when I started sprinting, it also started sprinting keeping up with me for what seemed like at least a mile. When I would walk, it would walk. It was loud as it went thru the woods as I stayed on the road hoping for a car to pick me up.

I started to fix the tape again when my buddy said \"what the hell is that\" I looked up to see a very large gray haired creature stepping out of the bushes.

    " My husband and I were taking a woods cruise and were driving in the northern section of Brendan T. Byrne Forest on St Mary''s road. It came to a dead end so we stopped to look around and there was a pond and a little path so we decided to walk our dog for a bit. We had only gone in a little ways when we smelled kind of musty mildew odor typically not smelled in the woods. This kind of freaked my husband out and he wanted to go back to the car. So we started back the way we came and then turned down Buckingham Whiting road. We drove this for a bit and came across a little bridge. We stopped because I like taking pictures of the water. After a bit we started to drive off. I am driving and in a split second I saw something brown on 2 legs and about 6 feet tall sprint behind the car in the area we were just in. I caught it in my rear view mirror. I was kind of thinking to myself that my eyes were playing tricks on me but I just couldn''t shake it. I stopped the car and husband told me to go in reverse. As we approached the area he thought he heard branches snapping and a splash into the water. He didn''t see anything so we drove on. We just kept talking about what I saw and if it was a bear a deer a person. I said it was definitely on 2 legs. It was quick and it was light brown but thin. We drove a little more and turned around and went back. On our way back I thought something was rubbing in my brakes because we heard like a wuh wuh wuh wuh wuh - we stopped and he looked under my car and didn''t see anything. He thought maybe it was what I saw making a warning call. ",

    " Being an avid outdoors man and interested in various types of wildlife since childhood, I''ve had my share of camping, canoeing, hunting, fishing, finding Native American artifacts, and hiking, etc.  On one particular sunny spring day during 2011, I decided to walk some trails adjacent to Brendan T. Byrne St. Forest opposite Rt. 70.  On one side of the sandy/gravel trail is a pine forest, on the other a downward slope into a densely wooded swampy area where a stream flows.  At one point a few yards into the swampy area, I heard an unrecognized sound similar to a cross between a bird call and a whistle type noise at which I stopped dead in my tracks in attempt to see what made this unusual sound, but saw nothing. Within a few seconds just to the side of this noise I heard the smashing and crashing of large wet logs on a level the likes of which I have never heard before.  This ruckus appeared to be purposeful in origin as if the creature was attempting to make as much noise as it possibly could...And it was succeeding!  Having known several friends and family members who declared witnessing large bipedal hairy creatures in New Jersey, I immediately surmised this, too, must be a Bigfoot or Sasquatch type creature.  After all, I''ve worked several seasons with very large animals at Great Adventure''s Safari Park. I''ve touched, fed and/or pet elephants, rhinos, American Black Bear, European Brown Bear, tigers, leopards, bison, elk, etc., therefore I feel I have slightly better idea as to the average person, what size animal could make such a disturbance.  In addition, I have a fair understanding of a variety of large North American mammal''s behavior, and this seemed to fit nothing other than Bigfoot.                                      As I stood there mostly in silence, the animal slowly proceeded deeper into the swamp, all the while smashing and crashing.  Since I understood that bigfoots normally don''t harm humans, at one point I quietly verbalized to myself, \"MAN, THIS IS REALLY COOL.\"  On the other hand I thought that if this thing is as angry as it sounds, I didn''t want it to come bebopping onto the trail, since there was likely little or nothing I could do to protect myself.                                           <BR>As the ruckus began to dissipate, it seemed as if the creature wanted me to believe that it was further into the swamp than it actually was. I estimated it to have stopped at approximately forty five yards away.  I stood there quietly for a number of minutes but heard absolutely nothing, not even a bird.  I then slowly proceeded down the trail in search of any type of tracks, but saw nothing other than mine.  Some distance down the trail, I came upon where the creek is at its closest, then heard what sounded as if either a very large animal jumped into the stream, or another large wet log was smashed, about forty five yards away.  I stood there silently for a few more minutes but heard no further noise, then I proceeded home.  At one point I had realized this creature must have paralleled me from the time I first heard it, to the last smash or splash, and yet during that period I didn''t hear so much as a twig snap!                         After further contemplating the matter, I feel there may have actually been two creatures; one making the initial vocalization, and yet another the ruckus.  After going on-line listening to recordings of alleged bigfoot vocalizations, I came across one in particular that sounds nearly identical to what I heard yet quite unlike any other animal with the exception of a chimpanzee.  [The high pitched sound of the 1972 aggressiveness and whistles from Al Berry and Ron Moorehead.]                  From time to time I revisited the location and on Sept. 3rd, 2016, I strongly feel that I had found a stick formation right between where I heard the initial sounds and the last smash or splash.                                          From 2011, until now, I am convinced that the weight of the animal smashing through the swamp must have been at least twice the weight of a fully grown male black bear, or equal to that of a male grizzly bear, at least 600 pounds.",

    " On June 20th at approximately 6:40 pm I was travelling on Route 563 south of Chatsworth near the Franklin Parker Preserve speedwell entrance. I was looking to see what the parking situation was there for a future hike so my eyes were on the right side of the road when out of the periphery I saw what I thought was a ground hog on the left. It was very large and I realized that it would have to be a huge ground hog so I looked fully to the left and I saw an approximate 3 to 3.5'' tall creature stand up on two legs as I passed by. I did not get a good look at the face and I almost continued but I decided to turn around about 150 yards up on a dirt road that''s on the right. <BR><BR>I pulled in and turned around and headed back to the location. There is a bend in the road there. It bends around to the right on the way back as I made it past the bend, approximately 30 yards in front of me the creature was still there. It was now fully turned towards me and I could see that it looked like a cross between Curious George and the character Chaka from the land of the lost. It''s face and hands as well as the tops of it''s feet were hairless and a light tan in color. The fur it was covered with was a golden brown a little darker than a golden retriever, very much like the color of a groundhog. I could not see the nose. Wen I locked eyes with it I could not see whites just big dark brown eyes. It stood there for a second or two when I rounded the bend and then took off running back into the swampy area. It ducked behind a short bush and when I drove past it I could no longer see it. <BR><BR>I turned the car around again and when I went by again it was gone. I waited there a bit to see if I could see anything moving in the field. I couldn''t so I took off. It was a couple days before I shared the experience with my family and friends. In that period of time I thought for sure someone was going to report a missing kid in a Halloween costume. <BR><BR>When the thing took off running it was fast! I would describe it as the fastest kid on the 10-12 baseball team. <BR><BR>We had really bad storms that night and my commute was a disaster. It poured all through that area and I thought it was odd that the thing I saw appeared to be dry, at least the fur was.     <BR><BR>         ",

    " This sighting had happened when me and my girlfriend were driving on one of the dirt trails off Route 72.  We had just gotten on the trail and I wanted to stop for a second.  After being stopped for a few minutes, I looked up and noticed my girlfriend looked like she had just seen a ghost.  She said that she just saw something tall and light brown walk across the road we were on.  So I said it was probably just a deer or something.  <BR><BR>I got out and looked around, and I saw some bushes moving and heard some rustling.  As soon as I turned my head I saw this face of an animal about 6 feet high looking straight at me through this big pile of brush.  The face itself was black but the hair was a dark sandy to light brown color.  It looked like the face of an ape.  The hair on the top of its head was somewhat long.<BR><BR>After looking at it for a few seconds I shook my head to see if i had seen what I thought I had, while I was doing so the animal had run away.  I saw it running for a second but then I turned back  to my car and got in.  Once I was in I asked her what she thought she saw.  She said that it was the same thing she had seen when we went camping six months prior to this.  <BR><BR>We went camping near Tuckerton but we had taken a detour to Apple Pie Hill.  There is a ranger lookout tower there, so went to the top and she looked down and said what the hell is that.  I pointed my flashlight in the direction but didn''t see anything.  She said she saw something running in front of the tower and it looked like the same thing she had seen. But once I had gotten back into my car I looked around for it again but didn''t see it.  So I put my window down and started driving, I could hear something running toward my car so I stopped and turned off my car again.  I still heard something coming my way, it sounded like a human or something running on two feet as opposed to a animal on 4 feet galloping through the woods.  After a few minutes of listening she was getting nervous so I had turned around and headed home.",

    " Riding my bike through the woods with some friends. I had to stop to wait for them. When I heard a branch snap, No more than 40 ft away it looked right at me with large black eyes. It was about 8''-9'' tell, I got a good look too I will never forget. He was proportioned the same way a human being would be, it was scary. With blackishbrown-rust colored hair. The hairs on his arm were about 3\"-4\" long. His forearm was about the size around as my leg. About 20 inches around. His strides  were long say 10'' per step. He must have been watching me for sometime cause I was stopped already a minute. When I heard a  branch snap, I glanced over I was shocked and tried to figure out what I was looking at. He just stared. No noise, no motions, no jesters,  no nothing. Very frightening cause you don''t know what he is capable of. It was as if he was thinking of coming towards me. He was very close, I froze like a rock. I turned my head to see what my friends were doing. Then turned back to look at him, he was still there. I know he got a good look at me too, cause it looked like he stooped his head down slightly and peered hard at me. Then he turned raised his arm to gain his balance and stepped into the woods. He didn''t turn away from me but rather walked to my left his right then I lost sight of him.  I have told this story to many many people but I don''t think anybody believes what I saw. I guess like I didn''t believe either until I saw one with my own eyes. ",

    " It was at least 2:00 am, in January or Februrary. The temprature was in the low teens. <BR><BR>I was dropping a friend off at his home, the back of which was separated from the Highway (Rt.72) by about 150 to 200 yards of woods and a dirt road.<BR><BR>There are no homes or streetlights on this part of Rt.72. The east side of Rt.72 is completely untouched woods for miles into Burlington county. This area was the end of a development that had never been finished.  Work stopped in the late 1970''s, as part of the Pinelands Preservation Act. <BR><BR><BR>There was a dirt road about 30 yards behind the house,which connected to the East into a grid of unfinished, unpaved roads. At that time his house was the last house on that road, completely surrounded by woods.  <BR><BR>We were talking beside the car under the streetlight for at least 20 minutes, when we both heard a woman screaming.  It sounded like it was coming from the unpaved road behind his house. We both thought someone was in trouble, so we ran inside his house and grabbed a flashlight, knife, and a hatchet. <BR> <BR>We ran into a trail along the right side of the house, (south-east) which led out to the dirt road. We could hear the screams getting louder and more to our right in the woods.|<BR><BR> We were only about 40 paces into the woods, when I started feeling very uneasy, and I started to realize that this wasn''t a woman screaming. I could hear it now to my right, more like a loud whistling now (not ahead in the dirt road like I had thought) about 15 yards away.<BR><BR>We both stopped and listened for a few seconds, my friend had the flashlight scanning the woods which was new growth oak saplings, blueberry bushes (waist high) and 12'' to 14''ft. scrubby pine saplings(20 years old?). I could hear it heaving as it breathed in and exhaled out with a very loud high pitched whistling, we couldn''t see anything but It was very close to our right as we faced southeast -- within 10 yards. <BR><BR>  My friend immediately turned toward me and said \"that ain''t no girl screaming\" and quickly moved past me back toward the house. I was standing still and listening, it was still screaming right at us. At this point I knew it wasn''t a girl at all, more like a loud whistling is how I could best describe it. There was no noise other than the screams. There was no movement at all. No sound of struggle. I thought that it might be a wounded animal, like a deer or something. <BR><BR>It was so loud and the deep breathing noises were from a much bigger animal than a fox. I could distinctly hear it breathing in and out rapidly to make the screaming noise.  I remember thinking that it''s dangerous to be this close to a large wounded animal.  It was not like anything I had ever heard in my life. I turned and headed back, looking and listening. It was still screaming, but did not follow. <BR><BR><BR>We immediately called the police and reported it. Within 15 minutes we went back outside, now the screams were further toward the south-east, very faint now. It had definitely moved off quickly. The screams faded totally within 10 minutes. We listened for at least another 45 minutes but it was gone.<BR><BR>I don''t know what the police had done after we''d called. I had always thought it was a wounded animal of some kind. <BR>",

    " Me, my cousin Kevin and my three friends Timmy, Tyler, and Steve were walking round in the woods maybe a mile from my house in October or November of 2007. We always used to go out in the woods and do dumb stuff like spy on the construction  workers that worked at a nearby construction(1/2 mile away) site. We always knew that there was something fishy going on in those woods, but when something freaky happened we never stuck round to find out what. So we are about to enter the woods from a field and I start smelling this foul stench. I don''t say anything at first because I didn''t think I had to. I didn''t think anything of it, until I was taking a leak facing the woods, when about 20 feet down the tree line where my friends were, the brush started shaking violently, no one said anything, we just pointed our flashlights and I pointed my camera, but it was too far away at night to catch anything (if the night-vision on the camera was working I could have had something on video, but oh well). My friend said he saw a broad pair of  shoulders move right through the brush. We quickly decided it was a deer w/barely any further speculation. On our way through the valley, my friend (Timmy) noticed something run down the hill we were on, but it wasn''t clear enough to determine what it was. We got across the creek and a big tree that fell over was moved a good 10 feet from its previous position, and me and my cousin are pretty strong guys and we couldn''t move it at all. So naturally we were baffled. On our way out of the valley when we heard something moving in the brush next to us, so we all shined our flashlights at the bushes. My cousin and my friends Timmy and Tyler claim to have seen a pair of shoulders, when the lights where shined. I didn''t have a good angle, but I did see it as it crouched and shimmied its way through really thick brush. My 6''4 310 pound cousin was so scared, that he trucked right through some water to get out of there, we were all scared.",

    " This happened in the spring of 1975 in Pennsville N.J.  This part of town backed up to a wooded area that in turn merged with the wildlife refuge at Finns Point.  I lived in an apartment complex that backed up to the woods.  I was eleven  years old at the time but remember it like yesterday.  I was just after dark and I was taking the garbage out to the dumpster.  Two friends of mine came running from behind the building in a panic.  I ask what was wrong and they said they had seen a huge whitesh covered creature at the edge of the woods.  These kids were a year or two younger then me.  Me being the older decided to get my fathers 12 volt spotlight and take a look.  <BR><BR>As we made our way to the woods about 65 feet behind the nearest apartment, my flashlight caught a pair of glowing red eyes. About fifty feet from the edge of the woods.  There appeared to be a large creature on two legs behind a stand of trees.  The hair on my neck stood up and we all ran to tell our parents.

    " I was a Boy scout in the early 70\"s on a camping trip.on a summer night a friend and myself were walking on a gravel road with tall pine trees on both sides ,it was in the bass river state forest.the moon was full and we were getting ready to crest a hill when we smelled something really foul,I thought something was dead ,and nearby,I didn''t really think much of it. we crested the gravel hill when we heard gravel being kicked ,mind you the only light we had was the moon light.when we heard this we stoped and I was a little scared cauce I thought it might be some guy in the woods scopen us out. we were froze for a few moments as to not make any noise ,then we both saw a silhouette of a very large thing and what ever it was ,we were able to make out that it was like a giant hair ball running across the road.we were pretty scared at this point and looked at each other and said words like lets get the hell out of here .my guess is that it was at least 7'' tall with a heavy stride.we both took off back to camp,when we got back we told our scoutmaster and all he did was laugh and say \"ya sure now go to bed\".I kinda voided it out of my mind for years always beleving that something WAS there,and i just kept it to myself.Then I found your site and read the siteing of the boy on the bike in manahawkin,N.J<BR>thats about 3 miles from where we thought we seen one.I,m 37 now and to this day I still think about that night and wounder to myself was i dreaming that night or not.I DON''T THINK I WAS",

    " Have been out scouting research locations for snake studies on google earth and found an area that we really wanted to check out which was an open paleodune ridge that offered plenty of basking/nesting habitat that the snakes we were researching liked to use. The hike there was pretty rough, walking through knee deep wetlands at points and wrestling with tangles of greenbrier and other thorny bushes to get to the location which was about a mile and a half back into the woods. Upon finally arriving at the site we were able to settle down and start looking for good spots that the snakes we were looking for used. As we were walking up one of the ridge fingers, we came upon an abandoned hunting stand that looked like it could be used as a shelter. I was a little unnerved because we didnt really wanna run into someone out there especially if they werent expecting company. <BR>As I was looking around my friend went back behind me to look around or use the bathroom while I continued to look. <BR>I began to hear bipedal walking in the swamp below us, what sounded like sticks breaking and snapping. I was pretty freaked out thinking it was a hunter so I yelled down at it saying hello? Anyone there?. No response as I continued to look I saw part of a dark figure go tree from tree. Long enough to know I wasnt imagining it, but not long enough to identify shape, size and detail. My memory fails to remember exactly how tall off the ground it was but the encounter lasted several seconds, from when I first heard the walking, saw the dark flash and when it subsequently disappeared or stopped in the swamp. After this I rounded up my friend and we headed out of there pretty quickly not knowing if a nearby hunter was there or worse, some crazy dude was stalking us. <BR>A few days went by before I really began to realize what I could have seen and it just made little sense that someone was out there  messing with us. <BR>Have since returned to the location to look some things over, large game trails surround the dune. But other than that, not much further evidence was able to be found.",

    "As described above, the spot of the incident was on top of a large paleodune ridge (sandy, upland areas) with thick swamp surrounding the area. The ridge itself had an undergrowth of low bush blueberry and huckleberries with pitch pine trees spread out sparsely without about a 25-50 % canopy coverage, so very open. Large cranberry bog nearby that has lots of prey items such as various frog species, deer, fox, snakes and lots of edible vegetation.",

    " At approximately 7 PM on Wednesday, November 16, Jon E., Dan F., Dan W. and James O. and I met at my house to watch a Philadelphia 76er''s game.  While watching, Dan F. noticed a human-like creature walking in the street in front of my house.  From the living room window, we all observed a creature which appeared to be just under six feet tall walking away from my house.  The creature was about 150 feet away and passed under a street light, which gave us the ability to get a decent look at it.  It was long limbed, but clearly not human.  Because of the lighting it was in silhouette, but we could see that it was covered with hair.  It was walking with its shoulders hunched forward, and did not appear to be in any distress.  We watched it pass from view as it went behind trees and into the woods on the far side of the street.<BR><BR>I live in a quiet neighborhood that is located in a wooded area.  My house is on a street that is a cul-de-sac, and there is very little traffic.  There is a quarry less than a quarter mile away through the woods.  In the 14 years that I have owned this house, I have routinely heard animal calls that can''t be identified as dog barks, etc., and have seen droppings and footprints in the woods that have not been from any animal such as a deer, etc., that would be seen in this area.<BR><BR>This is the first instance in which I have seen a creature that I believe is a bigfoot.  Because we were all shocked by what we saw, we did not attempt to pursue this creature, but we were able to observe it for 5-7 seconds before it passed from view.<BR><BR>In the minutes that followed, we all discussed what we saw.  While my friends, who do not live in this neighborhood, were initially reluctant to acknowledge that it was a bigfoot, after I explained the things that I have heard and seen around my house over the years, we all agreed that the creature was not human, and clearly fit the description of a bigfoot.

She said that she had heard it, but with the noise from the wind rushing through the windows it hadn''t registered. <BR><BR>I decided that the sound was too odd and urgent to ignore, so I made a U-turn at the next possible point and slowly made my way back to the section of road where the sound came from. As we approached the stand of trees (now on my right), we began to hear the shrieking sound again. I stopped the vehicle near to the point where the sound was coming from. The shrieks would last about 4 or 5 seconds with a one or two second pause in between. Our immediate impression was that it was like a young woman in sheer terror or agony. After a very brief moment we decided that no, it sounded more like a hawk or an eagle. Then, again we thought it could be human, because it was just too powerful to be coming from a small animal. <BR><BR>Unable to determine what the sound was, I decided to honk the horn to see what the reaction would be. There was no change in the shrieking so we decided that there probably wasn''t a crime in progress, because the perpetrator would probably have stopped, or the victim would have intensified or vocalized their pleas. At this point about 20 seconds had passed since we had returned to the area. The sounds seemed to be coming from the far edge of the trees, about 15 yards away, so we were unable to see where they were coming from because of the dark. We decided that to determine if something or someone was in danger or hurt I should step out and yell into the trees to see if the shrieking would stop, which I did armed with my sons wooden baseball bat. The first time I hollered the shrieking faltered and the second time I hollered the sounds stopped altogether. Total elapsed time since returning to the site was probably less than 30 seconds.<BR><BR>I got back in the vehicle and we waited several minutes and the sound didn''t continue. We went for a short drive and stopped at the area a few minutes later but we didn''t hear the sound again. My wife and I have discussed the incident several times and have never come up with a satisfactory explanation as to what could have made those sounds.<BR><BR>I grew up in Canada, where I spent most of my summers camping in the wilderness, so I can easily identify most animal sounds and responses. This creature didn''t seem to behave like an animal would when approached by a vehicle, a horn, or myself, until I hollered extremely loud two times. The sound was distressed, extremely loud, bordered on human, but was definitely not human, and I have no explanation for it. <BR><BR>",

    " I have e-mailed you before but wasn''t ready to describe my encounter.I have also offered to help in the area of investigations I am experienced in the outdoors and have tracking skills among other skills that would be helpful I am an experienced investigator as well as acriminal justice student.I had an experience many years ago in Jackson NJ, I was a teenager then. My younger brother and I and 3 friends set out to steal some wood from a house that was being built to build on our fort. We really didn''t think anything wrong of it at the time we were all pretty young.It was about 8:00 pm when we set out we would have to walk back through our friends property to get to the house. About 3 acres of property past some old chicken coupes and down a narrow path with thick vegitation and trees.I was in the lead position and everyone else following single file through the woods. All I had was a small disposable flashlight it only covered about a 10 foot distance. We figured one flash light so there would be less of a chance of being spotted. As we past the chicken coupes we heard a sound ahead of us in the darkness but figured it to be our friends dog, thinking it followed us. We kept going I was still in the lead with the flash light it was just pitch dark around us surrounded by trees and bushes we could no loger see any house lights from our friends house. I would shine the light behind me now and then to make sure my brother was ok and everyone was keeping up. Then I got butterflies in my stomach I felt like some one was watching us telling my friends to be quiet so I could listen for any one. I shined the flashlight around but couldn''t see anything then I heard a noise in front of us I spun around and all I could see was a very large figure what ever it was it''s eyes reflected red it looked like a siloute in the darkness with my small light. I tried to talk to it saying hows it going? but got no response then the figure moved closer and I got scared and yelled to my friends to run  but they began to pick up anything they could to throw it at the figure once that happened I heard a deep low growl and began too run right past my brother and friends. Then they followed suit when i got to the chicken coupes I plowed through the door and my friends and brother followed me in.We were scared as hell we didn''t move for probably an hour we just sat there listening for this thing. When we got brave enough we ran all the way back to our friends house telling his mom and dad what happened but they did not believe us. We then decided to brave again and go back out to look for this thing with base ball bats. We did alot of talking but never went back I think we were just trying to save face with each other. I know what I saw wasn''t a man it was just to big and the eyes were red like a dark red. And I never heard of any bears in Jackson NJ and I lived there for at least 13 years. So I don''t know what it was but i''m positive it wasn''t a man.",

    "   Even after all of these years, I still find it difficult to discuss what exactly I saw.    I still vividly remember the encounter and how terrified my friend and I were afterwards.  Its amazing how time slows during intense moments, every detail is burned to memory, but in actuality only several seconds passed.  To be honest, I dont know exactly what I saw that summer evening long ago.  As a child growing up, we were taught in school the legends surrounding the Jersey Devil and weird happenings in the Pine Barrens.  Hopefully this story wont be viewed as lore that the region is famous for.  The only thing I can say for sure is, it really did happen and I will do my best to portray the event as I remember it. <BR>  I grew up in a middle size town, a few miles from both the Jersey shore and the edges of the Pine Barrens.  My neighborhood & town were undergoing a growth spurt and wooded areas where I played as a kid were now strip malls or homes.  My house was on a corner lot and the neighbors house directly in front was a summer cottage (they were not there at the time).  I was 18 in 1989 and recently graduated from high school, with a strict midnight curfew.  My friend dropped me off on time with the passenger side of the car facing the front of my house.  I was outside of the car talking to Scott through the passenger side window, when we both heard a rustling sound near the trees on the corner of my neighbors property, about 30 feet away.  There was a street light on the opposite corner, and I could not make anything out beyond it.  We didnt think much of it and continued to talk.  The rustling returned a little louder, and with a sound that I remember as something being dragged on concrete such as a stick.  <BR><BR>At this point I asked Scott if he saw anything over there.  At first he replied no, then he hesitated and said he sees something like a big dog that is sitting by the trees.  Not wanting to be bit by some rabid dog, I got in the car.  We went up the road and turned the car around on the opposite intersection.  Once around, we were facing my house, and there was what appeared to be a large grayish dog directly under the street lamp.  We started moving very slowly towards my house, and as we got closer it really didnt appear to be like any dog I had every scene before.  When we were about 50 feet away, I turned to Scott and asked him to turn on the high-beams.  It is here where things happened very quickly, and I will try to capture it as best I can.  To our horror, what we thought was a large dog stood up and began to run on two legs.  It crossed the car and ran on an angle at first towards the middle of my house, but then quickly changed course and went around the dark side of my house.  We were both yelling, what the h**l, was that repeatedly.  The creature was very tall, his head was taller then the top of the windows on the house so I estimate around 8-feet.  He appeared to be a light gray in color, but it could have been the lights reflecting off his hair.  His arms were long and lanky, and sort of swayed forward and aft as he ran.  The creature had amazing speed/agility, and ran with what one would consider to be an odd gait.  His head was tilted forward and he might have been slightly hunched over.  His head swayed between looking forward and looking at us.  I will never forget the way his eyes reflected in the headlights.  The total time we had eyes on the creature was between 3-5 seconds.  Once he disappeared, the car accelerated around the corner and Scott slammed on the brakes.  Expecting to see the creature in the headlights, there was nothing but dark road..he was gone.  <BR><BR>Not wanting to get out of the car we proceeded to Scotts house a few miles away.  After a quick phone conversation with my parents, they ordered me home.  They were waiting out front when we got there, and we tried to explain what we saw.  My parents would hear none of our tale and assumed we were either drunk, or on drugs.  We were both rather shaken by the event, and my parents began to question their original assessment.  Over time came the inevitable ridicule of family and friends, and with their mocking I never really wanted to discuss this with anyone again.           <BR><BR>It took years before I was comfortable being alone, especially at night.  After spending time in the military, I came to the realization that he was as scared of us, as we were of him.  While I no longer have the fear, there isnt a day that has gone by without me thinking of that night.                  <BR>",

    " 2 weeks ago i went into the pine barrons in manchester nj ,deep in forest to shoot a pistol. i left the gun in the car and scoped out the area before i started shooting. i started down a trail and when i turned the corner i heard heavy heavy footsteps run away from me and smell a skunky/homeless person type oder. i looked around area but saw nothing. then i walked in another direction and found a stream or pond.  then something threw a rock into the water making a good size splash. i now went back to the truck and got my gun when i went back to the trail. i saw nothing but thought this might be a bigfoot. couldnt stop thinking about it so i went back a couple days later with a bigger gun and an axe. when i got to the spot where this hapened i heard a loud call like choom choom choom choom. this startled me and i cocked the hammer. i then heard footsteps coming tawards me in the thick vegitation. it came within 15 feet away and stopped. i could not see it through the brush. with my gun pointed in its direction it threw a large stick that landed along side of me.  i said \"hello ?\"  any body there, but no reply. i almost emptyed the gun into the bush but desided not to because i cuoldnt see the creature. i could smell it ,feel it, here it, and it threw something at me twice! i backed off and walked back to my truck the whole time ready to shoot if it atacked me.when i reached the truck this thing let out another call only much louder and much closer choom choom many times. a small bird on a tree branch began to act crazy. i took this warning and left. this sunday i went back with food, i took food to the spot where it threw the stick and backed away. then i heard some vocalizeations and got one of them on mini disc recording. sounds kinda like / coo coo kaa kaakaa coo coo ka kakka. went back to the trail to see if food was gone and was met by more stange bird behavior. many birds fleww rapidly out of trail as if some thing scared them out. when i looked down the trail i heard a loud snap of a tree or branch being broken. i backed away and soon after heard some low moans and groans, much too low to be a person. i also smelled the same oder again. this thing has an exeptional abilty to hide. all three times it was very close to me but for some reason i could not see it. i am convinced this is a sasqatch or more than one of them. i can take you or researchers to this place in nj pine barrons. this story is not a hoax and i dont beleive a person would be dumb enough to throw sticks and rocks at a man with a gun! i saw alot of good size trees (5or6inchdiameter) broken in half.",

    " Ok so I would like to keep this somewhat discreet because my family still to this day use what I told them as a joke against me and I don''t need everyone in my town talking about me cause this just sounds ridiculous. This happened near Toms River NJ. Me and my buddy were on our way to a job in Browns Mills and we''re traveling down route 70 which is known as the pine barrens. It was sometime between 6/7 am and about 7 deer came shooting out from the right side going left across route 70. I didn''t slam on brakes cause it was like 50 feet in front of us but I stopped pretty fast and I kid you not there was a big hairy grey and brown thing that came running right up to about 3 feet from the pavement and it stopped and turned around and ran the other way back into the woods. Since I seen this I started watching that finding Bigfoot show but their videos and pics are always something black. This thing was light grey and brown and it was huge! I mean huge like 8 foot tall and big like fat big. It could not be a guy cause it had like hair all over its face! Like I didn''t even see its eyes or lips or nose.  It was like hair for a face. We seen this thing at about 25/35 feet. I know it was real cause my man was like totally in sync with describing it to each other. It was all we talked about the rest of the way to the job. It was like what I was thinking he was saying and vice versa.  This was two months ago and that was it. Hope this helps you!",

    " Me and 2 friends were walking up the gas pipeline to fish a natural spring on the mountain, now privately owned by a hunting and fishing club. As we crested our first hill, all three of us all stopped at the same time. We saw a Bigfoot about 200 ft up the pipeline. I would estimate it to be over 7ft tall, brown and very shaggy. After about 30 seconds it ran into the wood line. It covered about 30 feet in three strides and disappeared. As we got to where it was you could see four spots where the tall grass was was pushed down from its steps.",

    " On a friday night in October of 1969 at 9:30pm,  me and another person were sitting in a car on Serviss Ave in North Brunswick, New Jersey. I was 15 years old at the time, and had just come home from a night out.  <BR><BR>We were parked on the right hand side of the dead end side of the block.  There are two houses on the right side of the street, then there is woods, and then Lawrence Brook. <BR><BR>The moonlight was shining from behind the car towards the brook. While talking I glanced up towards the brook when I seen two red eyes in the middle of the road about 35 to 40feet away. Immediatly I said \"whats that thing in the road?\" The driver turned his headlights on and thats when we could see that this thing was not a dog or, person, or bear.  This thing was hunched down on the ground, and from the ground to the top of its head, it looked to be three and a half to four feet tall. <BR><BR>After the headlights were turned on it sat there for about thirty second. We saw that it was hairy with three to four inch length reddish/brown hair and while standing it was about five feet tall. <BR><BR>After the thirty seconds it stood up turned around and sort of waddled into the woods at a snails pace.  We guessed it was ticked off by the headlights, and good thing because we were scared and locked our doors. <BR><BR>Once it went into the woods I exited the car and ran into the house. The driver threw the car into reverse backed out into Nassay Street, threw the car into gear and sped off down to Livingstone Ave. <BR><BR>After I went inside my house I told my mother, whose answer was it must have been a dog or bear, and thought nothing of it.  This was a one time occurance and I have not seen anything like it since, but I did hear other things when I lived there.",

    " Hi, It was october about 1030pm I was comeing home with a friend from work. you see we run a camp ground in the summer in bear mountian state park in NY. But we stay thier all year round,i love it. in the summer thier is lots of noise. We have as much as 300 kids at a time, overnite for 3 months. In late august every thing winds down. while the kids are thier you dont see much wild life. Even the deer, which we have a lot of,seem to find some where else to live. guess they dont like kids. It takes about a month for the woods to come back to life. this is the best time of the year because it is so quit. During the winters i do other work out side the camp to make money. this night I wasnt driving so i like to watch what the head lights find. the road are windy so the light ofen pan the sides where you might see a racoon or a bear. well driving in to our camp thier is a few s turns. when i saw some thing siting on a boulder about 30 to 40 yards up on the hill. I freaked, I asked my friend if he hsd seen that and he said what. I said back up and he did. when the lights hit it I said stop! wow It was brown hairy but you still saw some skin. It wasnt sitting it was crouching on all 4s. it ha dbeen stairing at my friends cabin, where his wife was alone. i was stairing right at it and i was close. when the head light hit it it sat for 3-4 sec stairing, before it leaped from a crouched position about 9 feet to anouther rock. It stud up and began to run away on two legs. I saw it run for about 15 to 20 feet before i couldnt see it any more. it was running down the other side of the hill. my friend still didnt see it. I asked him to drive up this little acsess road to get more close. but it was gone.",

    " <BR>In mid July, I was sitting at my computer at night, playing a computer game, with the television on behind me.  I was watching my sister''s dog while they were on vacation, and she was laying down in the other room.  At perhaps 7pm or 8pm I heard a howl in the distance, very far behind my house.  This is not uncommon, since there is a heavily wooded area where there are hills, and bears often live in the area.  A call from a mother to a cub is not unheard of, especially in evening hours.  <BR><BR>I made sure the dog was in the house and then went to the back and shut the back door.  I was not scared of anything getting in, but the dog often will run through a screen door to get to honking geese passing by, a neighbors dog or even a rabbit if it sees one in the back yard.  I heard the same, distant howl again a few minutes later and dismissed it.<BR><BR>I went back and played my video games for another hour, and then I heard the sound again, but it chilled me more so then I can ever explain in words to another.  The noise was not a bear, nor could any bear ever make such a sound  Bears make sounds which are deep and even grunting, however this was one that can only be described as a ''screaming howl.''  <BR><BR>What shook me so much, was that the sound litteraly was just outside my window, perhaps 20 feet or so, and was so loud, I litteraly almost fell out of my seat, it shocked me so baddly.  In the summer my windows are open, but to discourage bugs I keep the blinds closed.  My window is perhaps 8 feet off the ground on the side of the house, just to give a feel for the area.  <BR><BR><BR>Immediately my heart raced so fast, it hurt.  I knew for a fact, all I had to do was draw the blinds open and I could see what it was, since it was still light out, yet I could not.  I was paralyzed for the first and only time in my life.  I waited, expecting to hear the sound again, yet did not.  Finally after about a minute, I went out of my room and went into a more central room in the house trying to get away fom the sound, yet I would be damned if I would go near one of the screen doors.  In my parents room I found my sisters dog, and this animal, who usualy will bark and growl at anything, was laying in a corner, curled up and it had deficated all over the floor.  As soon as it saw me it just whimpered.  I closed the door and I myself sat down near it and waited for perhaps 10 minutes and after that, finally gathered enough courage to shut and lock all the doors, and didn''t hear or see anything afterwards.  The dog refused to come out of the room the entire night.<BR><BR>I am a 23 year old male who is 6 feet tall and 260 lbs, yet I was terrified plain and simple.  I had no idea what it was, and I still do not to this day.  I did not tell my parents of relatives, because they will simply say it was a bear, and perhaps it was, but I have NEVER heard a bear, nor any other animal make such a sound before.  ",

I pulled up to the house adjacent to the road leaving the truck running and lights on. I could smell a skunk like smell but thought nothing of it. I loaded the machine on the trailer, chained down one side crossed in front of the truck and noticed red eyes at about 75-100 ft down the road looking back at me they seemed taller than 6'' , just out of range of head lights. I quickly got the other side truck and chained the other side down and ran back to cab of the truck and saw the same eyes stairing back. I got into the cab and told the other person with me I had seen something. I looked up and the eyes had moved off into woods to the left. My problem was there was no way to back down the road and I had to trough where this thing was standing. I started the truck up the hill past the point I had seen the eyes and continued past to the in the road and prayed I could 10 point turn this thing turned around and get out of there. Upon pulling onto the side road and backing up and trying to get the truck turned around I saw those eyes 30 ft off into the woods looking back at me, eye level. This truck is a medium duty international 1954 series eye level is about 7 ft. I got the truck into gear and started down the road as fast as I could. Not looking back until I was several miles down the road. I told my friend I saw bear or wolve as to not alarm them. I know that bears dont walk up right at a steady level and they ussally run off after any encounter.",

    "  Well last year I was night fishing 9/2010 at Amawalk Reservior SOMERS NY about 30 minutes from PAWLINGS I was fishing with my buddy..the reservior was about 100ft into the lake before you got to water .....about 5am sun was coming out..when a 5 foot maybe 5 1/2 ft man  or Big Foot came out of the woods washed its face and drank some of the reservoir water..he looked like something out of the old school \"Planets of the Apes\" chimps..I said to my buddy \"you see that?\"?he said yes ..Now on Animal Planet there showing a clip of a Big Foot that has been seen in these areas (Lower Hudson Valley)..So I''m puzzled to think what I saw was a Big Foot....so this my account of what I saw..and we didn''t catch crap at night..anybody ever run into anything like this??...<BR><BR>This was my post on www.westchesterfishing.com<BR><BR>Low and be hold another member at the same reservior..Columbus day 2011..this is his post..Hey Guys,<BR>I put at Amawalk this summer and about the 5th time I took it out in early October.  I saw two upright walking chimp looking things walk out of the woods and crouch down and drink from the res, run back in to the woods and then do the same thing again.  When they came out the second time one of them threw it''s arms in the air while squatting and then they ran back into the woods.   The second one went back slowly.  It seemed like they saw something in the water right in front of them.  That was right when the sun came up.  I haven''t been back to my boat since.  I have no idea what they were and looked like two large chimps to me.  Maybe some guy who lives there has two monkeys or something?  I have no idea.  But I saw something that I can''t explain, it has been eating away at me since.  When I saw the preview for that show I almost shat myself.  When Biggame posted here I didn''t want to say that I saw something because I''m from Oregon and my hunting and logging part of the family thinks they know where they live but none of them have never ever seen them just have stories, just like everyone else in Oregon.  Then I saw what I saw in October and have been denying it to myself ever since.  I absolutely hope that someone owns two monkey''s on the Amawalk. <BR><BR>I have no reason to say something like this.  Before October I could have cared less if bigfoot existed, now I''m a bit curious.  I own a fishing rod company and have business to lose from people thinking I''m crazy for posting this on here.  This is a nothing to gain and allot to lose situation for me but, I had to say something when Biggame posted.  Let me be clear in saying that I saw something too.  I have no idea what they were and would need absolute proof that bigfoot existed before I would ever say thats what they were.  <BR><BR>So two seperate sightings same place different year..I BELIEVE!!!

    " I had parked my Volkswagen beetle at the junction of Rte. 17A and the Appalachian Trail, intending to camp out overnite along the trail.  I then hiked south on the trail about 4 miles, along a ridge that overlooks Greenwood Lake until I was perhaps just above the New Jersey line.  Since I had hiked this section of trail before I knew of an ideal camping site - a large outcropping of bedrock that rises about 10 feet above the surrounding terrain, and has a sheer drop off on the west side with a small swampy area on that side.  I unrolled my sleeping bag and bedded down as soon as it got dark, enjoying the magnificent view of the sky before dozing off.  About midnight I awoke for some unknown reason, and shortly after heard the most horrifying high pitched scream I had ever heard out in the woods, perhaps a 100 yards to my southeast.  I scrambled out of my sleeping bag, and quickly put my boots on.  Then the scream repeated itself, and I was positively terrified, as I knew it was miles in the dark to my car, and I had only a small flashlight.  Thinking to scare off, what I assumed was an animal, I screamed back at it, and was aghast when it returned my scream.  Several more screams were exchanged and then silence.  With my heart racing, I gathered up all the stones I could find in depressions in the rock I was camping on, and began throwing them in the direction the loud scream originated.  Then, to my horror, another scream came from a direction south-southwest of me, which astonished me as I heard no noise of movement, and in those days had extremely good hearing.  I hurled rocks in this direction, with more screams being exchanged.  This process went on for another hour, and then quiet, but I stayed up all night.  In the morning I checked the area where the noise had originated, and discovered it was covered with dry leaves, which made me more puzzled why I heard no noise. ",

    " My 2 best friends and I would take night rides into Harriman State Park late at night to see what we can spot at night, i.e. bear, deer, fox, etc. Its a beautiful park and the solitude at night in the off season makes the park special. Creepy too!  <BR><BR>As we were driving the very windy Garden Valley Rd we had to go slow due to the turns and danger of the steep drop offs on the road side. I was a front seat passenger, high beams on. Driving no more the 25-30 mph.  At the max viability of the headlight I see the outline of a large upright being running across in front of us and leaping the bank on the high side of the road, instantly disappearing into rhododendron thickets. I freaked out upon first visual and alerted my friends. The driver hit the breaks, windows open we could hear thrashing of the ground from running  but the sighting was over.  <BR><BR>My friend the driver did see movement but couldn''t make out what I made out. We both agreed on the sound of it fleeing up the steep slope. What solidified my two friends belief in what I saw was the look of fright and amazement on my face. Features of the upright being I saw were large thick long hair covered legs, human like strides, and tall enough that the headlights did not focus above its midsection, so I couldn''t make out facial features.  We were not drinking or doing any illegal substances.  <BR><BR>I would love to be able to speak to the park worker who had a sighting in the same location. I am so excited to finally be able to tell this encounter. ",

I followed them and they led around the back of our house to another tree.  The footprints then circled around the area in front of the tree about 4 full circles and then stopped.  There were no footsteps leading from the circle to anywhere else, as well as no footsteps back to the front of the house.

    " In the fall of 2000 my wife saw a large blk figure walking across a field and into the woods approx 300 yards from our home.My children stated that they saw something big and hairy behind our house approximately 3-5 days later. We never told them about moms sighting. also we had recently purchased the property and the home had been vacant for some time (curiousity ?) in the fall and winter of 2008 I heard some rather strange sounds when i was in the woods across from my home this happened when I was walking,hunting and cutting firewood. The first incident was when I was walking in the woods looking for deer sign for the upcoming hunting season.What i heard was something striking a tree with a piece of wood very loudly and repeatedly 5-6 times. I tried to duplicate the noise in an attempt to communicate but to no avail.Prior to the banging I would swear that i was being watched.I also found a strange footprint at the base of a cluster of cedar trees, the print was 8-10 inches long but it was muddy and the print was not clear but looked as something slipped in the mud the print was human like but not human.the cedar tree was stripped of bark for some reason.The next incident was while hunting I heard 2 somethings that were very heavy walking on the ice and breaking through I thought that they were very large deer and that i would see them as they were coming towards me but they suddenly veered away and were never seen. The reason i know that they were heavy is that i weigh 270 pds and I was walking in the same area and i did not break through.I have heard long screams at night coming from the same area and the latest incident I was cutting firewood and when i shut the saw off i heard a large amount of vocalization coming from approx 1/4 mile away. These noises could only be described as monkeys yelling at each other,and the reason I say that is ,while on vacation in TN I went to a outside zoo near Nashville and there were white faced monkeys there and the vocalizations that they made were very similar.I downloaded a file from the Sierra sounds and played this for my wife, she said those are birds i hear them all the time outside. I proceeded to tell her that the noises were of a sasquatch not birds and i showed her the web site that i copied it from.I recall as a child seeing what i remember as a hairy man near a creek when my brothers and i were playing there, and we always felt that we were being watched when we were there.this creek was on my family''s property back in the woods not far from the swamp.

The neighbors house was about 8 to 10 feet away with no french between the properties.<BR><BR>On this particular night the light from the street light shown brightly into my bedroom and lit the entire room well enough to almost be able to read by its light. A few minutes after going to bed a \"figure\" moved into the light and cast a huge shadow on the opposing wall of my room. I amassed that this figure had to be standing with in only a few feet of my bedroom window do to the sharpness and size of the shadow. Also, considering the size of the shadow and the height of my window above the ground the figure had to stand at least 7 to 8 feet tall to cast such a shadow. I froze in my bed (and embarrsingly enough, I had wet myself in fright). I could not muster the strength to look out the window, I simply froze. the shadow remained for all of about 20 to 30 seconds, then it was gone. About three to four minutes later heard a very loud crash of wood and metal as someone or something had ripped off the door to our back storage room. I heard someone or something moving items, then I heard the big freezer chest open (and the toys I had left on the freezer fall to the ground). Again, I was still frozen with fear and in my bed, and could not moved. There were some loud bumps and bangs as if something was throwing bricks around the storage room (our storage room was approximately 16 feet by 32 feet and attached to the back side or lake side of the house). After the banging stopped the freezer lid slammed shut and all banging stopped.<BR><BR>Later that night my step dad and mom had come home from work around 3am (they owned the restaurant a few blocks away) and started screaming and my mom was very very panicked. My mom called one of her friends that was also a good customer and was a State Trooper. I don''t know what was said between them.<BR><BR>The next morning my step dad and two of his friends were trying the fix the door to the back room. This is when I first saw the damage done. The room looked as if it were turned upside down, then right side up. My step dads large roll-away tool box was on its side and on the other side of the room, and packages of frozen meet were all over the place. A car transmission had been tossed as if a toy. The freezer had some faint scratches on the side and on the lid, but no tool marks or pry bar marks (my parents normally kept the freezer locked).<BR><BR>These same scratches were located on the side of the house and the removed door. <BR><BR>Missing were packages of my mom''s frozen strawberries, and two frozen turkey''s. None of the prepackage streaks or hamburgers, or lobsters were taken (they used this freezer as a back up to the freezer at the restaurant). <BR><BR>The State Trooper friend of my Mom''s said that it looked like three or four people had to of done this, but could not offer an explanation to the faint scratch marks. When I told my mom of the shadow figure my mom would only start to cry and hug me, saying we were so lucky that God had protected me from this situation.<BR><BR>Of note was the conversation between my step dad and our neighbor. Our neighbor told my step dad that he too had seen some kind of shadowy figure moving between the houses. Our neighbor said he had tried to let his dog out to investigate, but the dog would not go outside. But as soon as the figure appeared, it had gone away, and he had gone back to watching tv. Our neighbor did not hear any of the knocking or bangs in our back room.<BR><BR>At this age I had not ever heard of Bigfoot. But later, (the next spring) the other boys were talking about a \"monster\" called bigfoot that had been on TV, and for the first time (since that night)I froze again in fear (for a few seconds this time) and somehow knew what they were talking about, and what they were describing.<BR><BR>",

    " My wife and I were driving on a blacktop secondary road at approx. 11:30 pm, while returning home from my stepson''s home in Berlin, N.Y. This is a relatively rural area, with large expanses of forested land, just west of the Massachusetts and Vermont state lines. About 1 mile from our home we came around a bend in the road where another road, Davitts Lake Rd, intersects the road we were traveling, Blue Factory Hill Rd., and forms a \"T\".  At this \"T\" there is a street light, and opposite Davitts Lake Rd, on the other side of Blue Factory Hill Rd. (the road we were on), is a 4-5 foot embankment sloping away from the shoulder of the road to a large field, also sloping downward from the road and ending at a line of trees approx. 100 yards from the road. There was (and still is) a barb wire fence which runs parallel to Blue<BR>Factory Hill Rd. along this 4-5 foot embankment, <BR>with the fence post set halfway down the embankment so that the top wire of the fence is about the same heigth or perhaps slightly higher than the shoulder of the road. <BR><BR>It is at this location at the abovementioned time, under the<BR>illumination of the street light that I clearly saw a figure in mid stride hurdling over the barbwire fence, whose body was completely covered with red colored hair, not unlike the color of a red fox. The hair on my neck tingled, as while I<BR>was certain of what I was seeing, my mind was<BR>coming up blank as to any reference of what it actually was, and I felt a sudden rush of fear. I said to my wife \" what the hell was that\", and as our vehicle drew near the spot where I first spotted the figure, I could not draw myself to stop the vehicle, or even look in the direction of the field on my left where the figure was running.<BR><BR>Using the telephone pole from which the street light is mounted as a point of reference, I would estimate this figure to stand approx. 7-8 feet tall, and was totally human-like in respect to moving upright. <BR><BR>At this point I will turn the report over to my wife who watched this figure run down the field.<BR><BR>I did not see the figure leaping over the barbed wire fence - but I did see it running through the field.  It was very large, covered in red hair as my husband described and running in an upright position swinging it''s \"arms\" back and forth as it ran.  I knew it wasn''t a bear or deer - and as I watched it disappear into the wooded area, I had goosebumps on my neck and knew I had just seen something which was very unusual.<BR><BR>This event occured several years ago, actually<BR>back in 1988. Naturally we have been reluctant to<BR>share our encounter, as when doing so with even<BR>our closest friends, we are met with comments such as basically we''re nuts, seeing things, or it was surely a bear or deer. But we do not know either to be able to run upright like a human!<BR><BR>So--- having found this website we guess it''s time to report this, as after viewing some TV programs about \"bigfoot\", the only illogical logical conclusion we can come to is that our<BR>red haired figure was in fact a bigfoot, and since we saw this, they must exist, for we are both absolutely certain of the description of what we saw.<BR>",

    " My friend and I finished preparing for a big outdoors event and we were sitting outside his home.  It was around 11 p.m and his wife and dog had gone inside for the evening.  Across the road from his house there is a large swamp that goes up to a small mountain.  Our talk was cut short by an odd scream about 75 yards into the swamp on the right at ground level.  I asked my friend, an avid hunter, what animal screams like that?  He didn''t know but we talked that maybe it could be an owl or a fisher.  A few minutes later, in the woods on our side of the road, a large animal broke a lot of dead branches all at once.  It wasn''t running but seemed to have just turned around in one location.  A minute or two later three owls hooted between themselves at treetop level in the woods behind his house.  The owls seemed to have been about 50 feet apart.  We commented about this sudden weird activity when something came from the woods and landed in his yard behind us.  We were still facing the road and didn''t see the object but I assume it was something around the size of a baseball.  He doesn''t have a manicured lawn and it would be impossible to know exactly what it was.  I''ve thought about this incident for a couple of months and could write off the first three occurrences that evening but the object landing in the yard made this event too much to ignore.

    " On February 15th, 2004 at approximately 9:30 PM in Petersburgh, NY a resident on a rural road noticed his dog chained outside was extremely agitated. He stepped out on his front porch, when he heard several shrieking screams. They were continuous in nature. He stepped in and asked his wife who was watching television to step out and she too heard it   <BR>scream. The witnesses have lived in Alaska and the male witness is an avid hunter. He has never heard anything of this nature in his life before and described the vocalization as \"un-Godly\" and the loudest thing he''d ever heard before. <BR>The next morning, he observed a set of footprints in the snow coming from across the road, up a steep embankment and across the field to the west of the house in a northwardly direction. The strides were described as 5 - 6 feet apart. Note the field was covered with approximately 14 inches of snow. The witnesses'' son tracked the foot prints into the forest behind the house where apparently a second set of footprints joined the original set. <BR>Witnesses have lived at the present location for the past twelve years and this is the first time anything of this nature was encountered.",

    " A friend and I had decided to do some cross country skiing on the property owned by some neighbors.  We started out behind my house and worked our way into the woods.  There is an old logging road about a mile in that we hooked up to.  It was a sunny day in January, with a steady but light snowfall.  Along the way we had taken note of different tracks, as the area is home to abundant wildlife.  At this point we had come across several deer tracks.  We were studying the tracks and noting that most were not fresh, as they were already filled with snow.  There is a point in the trail where it splits and you can go to the right or left.  We chose right and continued back in.  This route is fairly short and takes about 10 to 15 minutes to reach the end where it abruptly stops in a an open field.  At this point we chose to turn around and start back out.  When we reached the spot where the trail had split, we were coming down a slope and nearing the fork when we noticed what looked like fresh tracks in the snow ahead.  They looked fairly big in size, so we decided to stop and have a look, thinking we may have stumbled across some bear tracks, which are not uncommon to the area.  When we reached them, both of us just stared,  They were huge!  And deffinitely NOT bear tracks.  Both of us are avid outdoor people and hunters.  Growing up in the area we are both familiar with identifying tracks.  To us it looked like our own feet (bare feet) only much larger and wider.  I''m not sure of the size, but with an educated guess I would say about 1 and a half to 2 feet in length or so.  We started to think that someone had possibly come back in and done it as a joke, knowing we were in that area.  The problem with that is, the area is accessible by vehicle but only an ATV or snowmobile, as the trails, although sufficiently wide, are no longer suitable for regular vehicles.  We found no tracks coming in or out from any vehicle, nor did we find any evidence that someone had walked in on foot or otherwise, beside ourselves.  However, no person could have made such tracks.  The tracks came out of the woods on the right side of the trail, crossed it and dissappeared back into the woods on the left.  We ventured into the brush on either side and noted that they were consistent in both directions.  There were no human shoe or barefoot prints to be found anywhere.  What really scared us was the realization that the tracks were fresh.  We had passed that same spot only ten or so minutes earlier and saw nothing, so we had to assume that whatever it was, had passed behind us after we went through.  That sent chills enough through both of us to get us moving back out double time.!  I should also note that the width of the trail is about 6 or 7 feet.  There were only 2 footpirints in the trail itself, telling us that whatever made them, had a very long stride.  To this day neither one of us has spoken of this until now, when a friend referred me to this site.  I still question what I saw, but have never been able to come up with a reasonable explanation as to what it may have been.",

My car is damaged from the hood to the rear by this creature and I know it is at the least injured and its DNA may be on my car. The speed limit was 55 and I was not able to stop in time. When I saw the creature, who was carrying a deer, about to step into the roadway I hit the brakes but was only able to slow down minimally before impact. I did not really believe in Bigfoot before last night and I am still shaken up and have not been able to share this story with anyone. I wanted to stop and see if the creature was okay, but I was scared out of my wits to stop and get out of the car. The creature was huge, at least 7.5 feet tall. I''ve seen drawings and such of Bigfoot, and this creature looked similar, but had white around his hairline, and his fur was dark brown, almost black. I''m shaking writing this and I am in such disbelief that this happened to me. I can''t even report the accident to the police, and I don''t know what I will tell my insurance company.

    " It was in the afternoon on a snowy winter day.1985. My friend and I decided to go for a winter drive(which was very common for me when it snows).We ended up at the entrance to \"Ice Cave Mountain\". Of course the attraction was closed. But we wanted to go for a winter walk and thought it would be pretty secenery in the untouched snow covered grounds.<BR>We stepped over the gate and began to walk the driveway towards the woods. We were talking with eachother in normal voice tones. The snow was about shin deep so as we walked, we were looking towards the ground to step through the snow as we go. <BR>As we approached the woods, we both looked toward the woods to see the snow covered trees and scenery, when all of a sudden, it took us by surprise as much as we took him by surprise.<BR>It stopped in its tracks to look at us. It was if it froze in place. (You see, these grounds are not occupied at all during the winter, so it was totally unusual for us to be there)It looked at us as we were frozen in our tracks staring back at it. It was about 150 feet from us. It was very large with brown fur/hair all over it''s body. It was absolutely human looking. It was walking upright just like humans walk. When it looked at us, it didn''t react in any deffensive way. It just waited a moment or two as if it was waiting to see what we were gonna do.<BR>When I was finally able to speek, I asked my friend if she sees what I see. And with that movenment, it seemed to have been frightened by us and started to walk away very fast,but it didn''t run. It just had a very long stride. It looked back at us again while it was leaving.<BR>Now mind you, we were the only people in the area. But we were curious and stupid.We decided to follow it. But then again we were very scared. We attempted to try and find footprints but were unable to. Maybe because we were too scared to look properly.<BR>I know what I saw.

    " My sister and her two children, my wife and I and our two dogs went to Nuclear lake in Dutchess county for an overnight camping trip. We set up camp in a field next to the lake a few hundred feet off the applician trail. We had two tents and went in them to sleep around 11:00p.m. My sister was feeling uneasy so I sent my male dog to her tent to sleep with her and the kids. My older dog, my wife, and myself were in my tent. I turned the opening of my tent to face my sisters tent door so she felt less stressed. An hour went by and the kids my old dog and wife were sleeping. Suddenly I heard foot steps coming from the woods heading toward us. It was a very dark night but I saw no flashlight shine. Then my young dog in my sisters tent started to make this whine/growl and I could clearly hear a person walk behind my sisters tent, but still no flashlight shine! All the while my sister was awake and my young dog freaking out almost crying and he is a pitbull not afraid of any critter. I KNEW it was a bigfoot and told my sister not to worry because she hates the woods and couldnt sleep. The next morning she looked very tired and we only spoke about it a month later on the phone. She said she knew it was a biped and couldnt sleep all night. My wife, my two dogs and I are trail runners and twice a week do 6 mile runs on this section of the Appalacian trail. It is remote and rugged and I have Moose dropping on my fireplace mantle from that area and bear sightings are common. A few miles up the trail is a large beautiful swamp also. This is not my first time I had the feeling bigfoot was around. My wife and I are in the woods more then anyone I know. We hike and back pack all summer and log 25 miles a week in the woods trail running. I made a report a few years ago when we were hiking up Buck mountain when a bigfoot was smashing trees and making that loud click noise like I can do with my tounge but 10 times louder. I know a woman who had a daytime visual in st. lawrence county n.y. and I also know a man who had a visual in penn. when he was hunting deer. What is the real story on bigfoot. Are they so slick that no one can get a good picture or do they just scare people so much that the powers that be dont want the cat out of the bag. I wont go in the deep woods alone anymore and I was never afraid but now I am and hate that feeling. I''ll give my name and number and I sure wish someone would call me. thanks.",

That is also near the Carvel property, which is not too far from a stretch of the Taconic State Parkway (between Rt 199 and Jackson Corners exit). The truck was bouncing around while they did donuts, burning around in circles in the field. My friend stopped the truck for a minute and they were laughing with the inside light on. The head lights were on too. While the truck was at a complete stop, the back end of the truck started bouncing up and down like someone was jumping on it. They didn''t want to get out and see what was causing it. They put the truck in gear and peeled out of the field. This happened around the same time, and within a matter of weeks, of my sightings.",

    " In 1985, my friend and I were driving along Lake Rd in Pine Plains,NY. It was late afternoon in spring or early summer.  It was a wooded area with a few houses. <BR><BR>While driving we both saw what looked like a large man move from the shadow of a large tree and cross the road in 2-3 strides. When we got up to the spot where \"it\" crossed into the area of the tall grass near the tree line, I remember looking for the \"man\" in the area.  <BR><BR>I was thinking in terms of a peeping Tom, because the \"man\" didn''t walk along the road. He just seemed to materialize out from the tree like he had been standing in the shadow of the tree, next to the road, out of sight of the house. <BR><BR>When I didn''t see anyone in the brush/grass, I took note that the figure had appeared light brown when s/he stepped out of the tree shadow. I also realized that if I crossed the road, I would have to take at least 5 strides.  <BR><BR>Next incident was also late afternoon, a week or two later, in the same area (a side road near Stissing Lake/Stissing Mt). <BR><BR>Sitting in a car at exactly dusk, my friend saw a tall, brown figure standing along the tree line next to the road, the same side we were on. There is a large ballfield on our left side and Stissing Lake beyond that, to the west. We were facing north.  <BR><BR>When she said \"what is that?\" (she didn''t say \"who\"), I looked ahead and couldn''t make out what she saw until I saw a movement about 100 yrds ahead. That''s when I saw a light brown leg turn into the tree line and a tall, upright \"man\" walk into the tree line. We decided we didn''t want to sit in the car next to the tree line about 30 seconds after we lost sight of it. <BR><BR>We drove the car slowly up to the place we last saw it but my friend (who was driving) didn''t take her foot off the gas and didn''t stop. There was a small shed there in the trees that the ballfield uses to store equipment. It is about the size of 2 outhouses. It certainly could have been hiding behind it.<BR><BR>Both times, I can say that the tallness of the figures, using the tree heights as a baseline, were definitely well above 6ft. <BR><BR>",

    " I was driving on a backroad in Rhinebeck, NY. I was heading to a rehearsal at the Rhinebeck Center of Performing Arts at about 6 :30 in the evening. The road is called Pilgrims Progress Road. While I was driving on this road, I passed a 20 mph road sign because it''s a sharp right turn, but on the same road. The road is very curvy. I passed this turn, and in the middle of the road was a Hannaford bag with an open cereal box, and a log placed in the bag. I had to go in the left lane to miss the bag. As I passed the bag, something darted behind my car from the left. I looked in my rear view mirror, and saw this big, black thing right where the bag was. At first, I thought it was a bear because it looked like it was on all fours. I kept driving, looking in my rear view mirror. After a few seconds, it was out of my vision. I kept driving down the road until I pulled into a driveway on the right, and turned around to see what it was. As I got to the location where the bag was, I noticed the bag was missing. I kept driving for about 0.2 miles down the road, past the 20 mph sign. As I turned, I saw something walking on two feet about 50 yards in front of my car. It was walking on the side of the road. I could see that it was definitely not a bear. It was black, and it looked as if the hair was short. It''s back was towards me, and the shoulders were very broad. It looked like it was slouching, and I couldn''t really see it''s arms. I don''t know if it was holding something, or if it was the way it walked. I''m about 6''5\", and It looked like it was taller than me from what I saw. I saw it for a good three to four seconds, until it leaped up this little hill to the right. I sped up to the location I saw it leap from, and got out of my vehicle. I looked all around because there weren''t many trees. The grass was very high though. I didn''t see it after that.<BR>I was nervous, confused, and excited at the same time.",

    " Not an actual sighting. However, I recently read an article in the Post Star Glens Falls NY newspaper about a BFRO gathering in Whitehall NY. To begin with, I had never heard of your organization nor knew that Whitehall was a supposed hot spot for Big Foot sightings. Let me tell you my story, all factual. <BR><BR>My family and I have owned property in the Dresden NY area (off of RT 22, a few miles north of Whitehall) since the early sixties through last year when I sold my property (located on Blue Goose Rd, old RT 22) last year. Back in 1999 while deer hunting off of Pike Brook Rd. in the Black Mt. area, I viewed some very strange tracks in the mud on a logging road and suddenly an awful, foul smell was in the area. <BR><BR>It was a damp, still early November day, thinking back it may have been Election Day. The time was around 8AM as I hiked up the logging road. The smell drifted away as quickly as I smelled it but it was distinct. I''ve never smelled anything like it since and I have been with hunters that took Adirondack bears and this odor was different. It actually raised the hairs on the back of my neck, it was definitely a strange odor. The tracks were sort of footlike but very wide. The toe area was mushed in the mud so it was difficult to determine if there were claws like a bear or any other type of distinguishing features. In retrospect, I should have reported this immediately but the only person I told was my wife and a few hunting buddies. No one completely dismissed my story but it was like, oh, thats something but I know what I smelled and sensed and it definitely gave me the creeps. <BR><BR>I am interested in your organization and I''d be willing to go back to the area with someone involved with BFRO and take you to the site. Please contact me at T********@nycap.rr.com to  discuss. Thank You.",

    " It occurred on a sunny June 17, 2015 around mid afternoon while we were boating along the eastern shore of Lake George, NY, just above the Narrows. The object we saw was located at approximately 43 degrees 35.086 minutes north and 073 degrees 34.347 minutes west per a Google Earth view obtained on 5-5-2015.  We were about 140 yards away (even though it didn''t seem that far) and the bearing from us to it was about 132 degrees true, again using Google Earth to obtain distance and bearing.  This section of the lake is state property and part of the \"Forever Wild\" section of the Adirondacks.  There are many square miles of wilderness here and this location is only about 8 miles from the locally famous Whitehall, NY sightings in 1976.<BR><BR>We were motoring in our 19'' I/O boat northeastish in a narrow channel between Sarah Island, Hazel Island, an un-named rocky outcrop and the mainland.  Our intended goal was Fox Island, a short distance away.  We were traveling about 5 mph, slightly above idling speed, engine rpm would be approximately 1000.  There is a point of land opposite the rocky outcrop and as we cleared it, a small bay exists on our starboard (right) side.  Since I''m always scanning the lake side to side for boat traffic, at that point in time, I was looking to the east into the bay and I noticed movement close to the shoreline.  It seemed that whatever it was, was caught by surprise as we cleared that point of land.  I then got my wife''s attention, she looked in that direction and also saw it.<BR><BR>My view was of a very large black animate object that seemed to quickly raise an arm (?) from it''s side to a horizontal position then turn away and move back and to the side (north) behind a nearby clump of coniferous trees.  I then spun the boat around for a better view.  Meanwhile, my wife (Debbie) was watching it.  Her impression was that it was large, dark, upright and didn''t move like an animal.  Her view was slightly restricted by the trees but she did notice that the object was swaying from side to side.  The only (known) animal that is large and black out here in the Adirondacks is the black bear and we both strongly believe it wasn''t a bear (I''ve seen many bears in the woods).  It was an observation of very short duration but long enough to impress us.  Unfortunately we can''t provide any accurate dimensions or descriptions of physical details but even though we''re not sure of what is was, we''re sure of what it was not!<BR><BR>We then continued on to Fox Island which is about 200 yards from the sighted critter and only about 50 feet from the mainland and chatted for a bit.  Eventually we got the charcoal grill fired up and proceeded to cook a traditional meal of dogs and beans, of course with the appropriate condiments.  We do this on a regular basis on the islands of the lake.  As we were eating, we both had a weird feeling so we QUICKLY finished our meal, loaded the gear back on the boat and left or as some may say, got the heck out of Dodge.  We''ve never had that type of experience on the lake before and are not sure if the two events are related.  I''ve recently become aware that some folks have a theory about how our favorite mystery creature may use/communicate with infrasound which could explain that feeling we both had.<BR><BR>We returned to the area on July 6, 2015 by boat with my brother who is an accomplished photographer to investigate the mainland.  By then, the NYDEC had installed docks in that bay so we could tie up to and go ashore.  We went to the area where the critter was first observed and noted that there was a small, probably seasonal stream that flowed into the lake.  We searched for but did not find any tracks or other sign.  However I recently purchased a trail cam and plan to set it up in that area.  Preliminary testing has shown that the motion sensor is very sensitive and wind generated tree movement will trigger it.  I''ve got a few ideas on how to mount it but am still trying to come up with the appropriate \"bait\".   Got any ideas?<BR><BR>Also this spring (2016), I shared our occurrence with BF researcher Bill Brann who runs the Northern Sasquatch Research Society who was present during a public screening of a documentary called Beast of Whitehall, The Abair Road Incident that was made by the Ohio firm, Small Town Monsters.  He then mentioned that he had a report of an anchored boat by Fox Island that had rocks thrown at it at night.  It was probably the same bay which is quite protected from boat traffic.<BR><BR>Again, we both have had over 40 years of outdoors experience and are very familiar with Adirondack wildlife.  Debbie is a retired Science teacher and I''m a retired manufacturing engineer of medical devices.",

With that said I have been going there for 25+ years and am very familiar with all of the sights and sounds.  My incident happened a few years ago in the spring of 1999.  I was camping the last weekend of May with one of my dogs on the south side of Lewey lake.  I think there were maybe a total of 5 camps being used.  One of the nights around 10pm I heard a loud and very unfamiliar cry/scream come from the north side of the lake.  I sat there in silence with my dog, almost in shock because I had never heard anything like this before.  It went on with a series of screams for about 10 seconds.  It was not a bear, not a moose, etc.  It made me a bit uneasy as I could not place the sound.  It was not from any campers either as there were only a handful and were all on the same side of the lake as myself.  I just went to this website today and listened to some of the sound clips available of ''BigFoot''.  The sound I heard almost exactly matches these clips.<BR><BR>",

We foolishly figured it wuld be an hour up and and hour back and we''d be home by supper and didn''t take a flashlight. It took 2 hours up and the sun was beginning to wane. Now my husband had a habit of walking very fast sometimes out of my sight and I kept yelling, almost crying,\" Wait ,wait for me!\"As it got near dusk, the road was darker and darker and I finally grabbed and held on to his arm so I wouldn''t be left alone and behind. Then we heard something big crunching up the ground just off the road in the woods beside us and following along with us.If we stopped, it stopped. I couldn''t tell if it was one or more but I think just one. aAll down the Mtn until we got to where the road kind of levels out for at least an hour or more that thing was in the woods following.He figured it was deer or a bear but would those animals do that? Then recently when I read that teens on the bike trail near French Mtn thought they saw something in 81 or 82 or 83 I began to wonder.

    " while camping in the Lake Luzerne/4th lake area we heard several hoot-whoops on July 24th at approx 0130--200.prior to hearing these whoops, I heard something large walking approx 20-30 ft away from our camp. a distinctive \"cracking\" noise was made as if something very large either broke or stepped on a large branch these vocalizations were between 2, and possibly a 3rd animal. they were heard moving away from our area. I almost wonder if they were herding prey for hunting purposes. approx 02 hrs later I heard them again as they moved back into our area.I have heard these noises before and I immediately recognized the sounds as they are so unique.there were 7 people in our tent. 4 teenage girls (my wife myself and our 10 month old son.we all heard them and needless to say the girls and my wife were a little startled.

    " On June 10, 2006 I was driving with my brother on a back road (unpaved) in the Adirondack Park. We were heading for a trail head that led into the Hudson River Gorge. This area is almost dead center in the park and surounded by many mile of unihabited and very rugged terrain. <BR><BR>It was late morning on a clear day. I was driving as fast as i could on this road because we had to get back to town by a certain time.<BR><BR>As we turned a bend I saw a very large, brown, furry, object lunge into the dense woods up the road at the next curve about 50 yards ahead. It was obvious that the creature was in the road and was startled by my speeding SUV.  <BR><BR>I told by brother, \"Hey, there goes a moose.\"<BR><BR>We reached that spot in about 3 seconds, and i slamed on the breaks - expecting to see the moose right there in the bushes.<BR>At that spot, through the bushes, was a decent sized clearing and then more dark woods that went down a hill.<BR><BR>There was nothing there at all. Everything was still. We started off again and took our hike.<BR><BR>The more I thought about it, the more I thougth I just could not have been a moose.<BR><BR>First of all it was the wrong color - a light chestnut bown. (The color was very visible because the sun was shinning in the area. It was a striking shade against the ligth green of the brush.) Moose are never that shade - they are always a very dark brown.<BR><BR>Second, the size and shape were wrong. This thing was huge - at least 7 feet tall. And the shape was not like a Moose rump. The more I thght about it, the more it seemed like it was the upper back and head of something.<BR><BR>Finaly, if it was a moose, it would not have utterly vanished so quickly. My vehicke got to that spot in just seconds. Moose, at least the ones that I have seen, don''t tear off into the wood. We should have seen it in the clearing.<BR><BR>It wan''t a bear, either. Not even close.<BR><BR>I wished I had stopped to investigate further. Unfortunately, we were in a hurry<BR>",

They were \"sing song\" in pattern and unlike anything I have ever heard.  The creature appeared to by \"talking\" to itself as there was only one creature.  It did not sound angry and lasted for about two minutes.  The sound change in pitch and fluctuation.  I was not scared but did leave quickly.  I have since studied sounds of coyotes and found no similarties at all.  There were no yelps, barks or growls.  I can not duplicate the sounds.

    "      This was recorded very soon after it happened in our camp journal. It was the weekend of May 11th 2002.  My wife and I were at our seasonal camp on Lake George for the early season.  We had bed for the night in front of the fireplace.  There were only a few lights belonging to other early season camps across the lake.  It was a calm night.  My wife was sound asleep.  She often sleeps through thunder storms.  I was up throughout the night.  I was awake for the sound of the first scream.<BR>     The first cycle did not wake my wife unfortunately the second closer scream did.  Someting screamed four times in the distance.  Thirty seconds later it screamed again, on our property.  We have less than a quarter acre of land.  The time was around 2:30am.  Thirty seconds to a minute later it screamed for the last time in the distance at a third location.  <BR>     The scream was in an evenly spaced pattern of four screams.  Each scream was about three to five seconds apart.  The volume was that of human sized lungs.  However, there was no attempt to form words or partial words.  The scream did not change pitch.  It sounded much like a human female.  There was no sound of the creature crashing through the woods.  Please note that a few years back a similar sound was heard by a camp only five down from us.  Other sitings have occured very near to my camp.  The screams made the hair on our necks stand up.  Very frightening.  There have also been sightings of mountain lions in the area.  However, sounds of the mountian lion''s scream were not like the screams we heard.  <BR>",

    "  My brother and I were canoeing on Lake George, in N.Y state at about sunset. We headed south for 10 minutes to an area known as Deer Leap. At lake side it is a boulder strewn area with cliffs rising 600 feet above the shoreline. As we were begining to come on to this area we saw something standing on shore. It was brownish in color and standing straight up with it''s arms at it''s side. It was about the size of a small man and very thin. Its body was facing south, looking down the shorline when it suddenly turned its head directly towards us and looked very intently. We  whispered to each other and watched it while it watched us. We were 2 grown men paddling parallel to the shore and about 200 feet out but we could not summon up the courage to go in closer. This thing had a strange look, almost a crazed grin. Like a giant Lemur.  The sun was set now as we continued to watch it in the shadows of the mountain. As it was standing next to an old, dead pine tree, it turned and climbed, sloth-like up the tree about 20 feet to the first and only large limb and onto the crook of a branch. We paddled back around and as we approached it again cocked its head directly at us, after a minute or so it turned its face downward into its body and became as if it were a part of the tree. Just a lump on the crook of the branch. You would not know it was there unless you saw it move. I have been in this area all my life and have never seen anything like this and have not seen it since.<BR> In my searchings I have found reference to a creature found in the woods of New Hampshire. Back in the 30''s they called it the \"Wood devil or Stick Men\". The one thing incommon is they are able to blend into trees to avoid being seen.",

Late one night a girlfriend and I drove out to East Bay and stopped to talk for a while.<BR><BR>After a few moments spent parked near the bridge, I saw what looked to be a man walking accross the marshy area to our left.  The distance, I am assuming, was about 200 to 300 yards.  This I gauged by seeing a fence line at that distance. At the time my tested vision was 20/10 (documented). <BR><BR>We both watched as this man approached the fence line.  He cleared it without stopping.  Simply stepped over it as if it were a low stool.  Knowing that the snow was not that deep or that hard to support a man of his apparent size, and that it was highly unlikely for anyone to be out on the marshes at that time of night, I stepped out of the car to get a better look.<BR><BR>As soon as I had gotten out of the car, the man changed course and began heading straight toward us.  I closed the car door to cancel the interior light, and prevent showing my location.  At this point the man broke into a run.  His speed was incredible.  He closed the distance between us very quickly.  My girlfriend was screaming for me to get back into the car at this point.<BR><BR>I got back into the car, and she drove back over the bridge into NYS.  As we went, I looked behind us and saw that we were being pursued, although we were building a gap.  As soon as we returned to hardtop road, he broke off pusuit and ran back into the forest near the bridge.<BR><BR>We returned to town and never spoke of this incident to anyone other than two trusted friends.  I have since told friends and relatives that I saw \"something\" out there but could not say that it was any animal I had ever seen, nor could it have been any man.<BR><BR>I should add that at that time I had spent 16 years working and playing outdoors.  I had encountered all of the major predators of our area, knew their habits and habitats.  I know that I did not mistake an animal for a humanoid creature that night.  <BR><BR>I will further add that I am now a Natural Resource Scientist with 16-years of experience studying and reporting information based on my observations and analysis.  I still cannot state with precision what it is I saw that night.",

    " Bigfoot Sighting<BR>Date: Early August 2010<BR>Time: Approx. 8-8:30 am<BR>Place: Cascade Lakes, NY (near Keene)<BR>Weather: Clear with a few clouds<BR><BR>I spend most of the summers camping in and around the Adirondacks in my Dodge Caravan. This particular summer I had stopped at Cascade Lake to spend a few days camping.<BR><BR>I had slept soundly the previous night and had woken up around 7:00 am. I decided to get up and start making my breakfast. I had just started the kettle on the camp stove when I looked over at upper Cascade lake and could see the mist rising off the surface of the lake. I grabbed my iphone and walked about 50 yards to the edge of the lake to get a picture. As I approached the breakwall, I noticed a dark brown object on the opposite side of the lake at the shore. At first I couldnt make out what it was but it seemed to be sitting at the waters edge. I then realized that it must be a bear. The animal looked like it was doing something in the water with its paws as I could hear a faint splashing sound. <BR><BR>I thought it would be a good idea to get a picture so I brought my iphone up to face level and tried to focus in on the animal. As I was focusing in, the animal stood up on two legs. I was startled and pulled down my phone to see this with my own eyes. It took a step towards the treeline and stopped. Almost methodically, as it stopped, it turned its whole upper body to the left and stared at me for a couple of seconds. It turned back and in one step, disappeared into the tree line. I immediately went cold and got scared. <BR><BR>As I ran back to my campsite, my only thought was that it was going to go left or right. If it went right it would have to go into the water and if it went left, it was headed directly for my campsite. I decided that it was best to get the hell out of dodge so to speak. <BR><BR>I arrived back at my campsite in under a minute. My dog was still asleep on the front seat and didnt stir at all. I opened the passenger side sliding door of my van and started to throw all of the camping gear back into the van, making quite a mess inside as I did. I closed the door and then jumped into the drivers seat and floored the gas to leave. <BR><BR>As I was driving out, I kept looking out my left drivers side window to see if I could observe it again, but I saw nothing. I drove all the way into Lake Placid and parked at a mall parking lot to gather my thoughts and think about what had taken place. I was pretty shaken up as I kept replaying the experience over and over in my head trying to make sense of what I had seen.<BR><BR>Observations:<BR><BR>I could not ascertain its height exactly, because of the distance, but I would guess that it was approximately 7-8 foot tall. It was covered head to toe in shaggy dark brown hair or fur. I could see the sunlight shining off its back as it turned to go into the treeline and could see the brown coloration as it turned away from me. <BR><BR>When it turned to stare at me, I could not make out any facial features but I knew that it saw me. The upper body was massive and stocky like a football players build. It had very long arms that went well below its waist. I could also make out what I assume were the shape of hands. <BR><BR>It walked upright and paused before slowly turning its upper body to look directly at me. It stared at me for approximately 5-10 seconds and turned back to face the treeline. It took 1-2 steps and disappeared into the forest. <BR><BR>I could see a couple of branches move after it went into the trees. It was then I decided to leave. I did not hear anything other then the initial splashing it made in the water with its hands when I first thought it was a bear. <BR><BR>I did not return to the area until three years later with a friend to camp. Nothing has happened on subsequent trips to the area of Cascade Lake. I have had two other odd experiences in other areas of the ADKs on other trips. ",

    " I didn''t have an encounter exactly but we are owners of a camp in a remote region of the Adirondack Mountains.  This camp is only accessible by hiking to it.  There is rarely anyone ever around our camp.  We have found strange things that have occurred.<BR><BR>1) Fall 2002: We went hiking for the day  and when we got back we found a small pile of rocks at the back door that were neatly stacked with a stick coming out of them.  These rock were not there when we left.  They appeared to be deliberately stacked.  We understand that these could have been made easily by a human, but there is never anyone around up there.<BR><BR>2)  Fall 2003: One night around 7:30 pm (dark) my wife and I  went outside with 2 dogs.  We smelled something very strong and musty, like nothing we smelled before.  It wasn''t the dogs or anything we could identify.  The 2 dogs got very antsy and wanted to go inside right away.  This was very strange and freaky, these dogs are generally not scared dogs.  They also are large dogs about 80 lbs. each. We had never seen them act this way.  When we bring them out at night or day they run all over the woods this night they wanted nothing to do with that.  Almost like they smelled something that scared them.<BR><BR>3)  The same exact night as number 2.  I went outside around 9:30 pm to relieve myself.  While I was doing that I heard large heavy stomping behind me. The stomping was loud and heavy as if something was fleeing.  The strange part is it sounded like it made 4-5 bounds then stopped.  I heard nothing else after that.  I looked around a little but the happenings of this night made be uneasy so I went inside and locked up the cabin.  <BR><BR>I don''t know what did all of this and maybe it is easily explained away but these things altogether make me think it might have been a bigfoot.",

    " My family owns a home on Chazy Lake in the northeast corner of the Adirondacks.  I spend many weekends there and often wake up early on Monday morning in order to get into work (about 1 hour away).  In February of 2005, I had gotten up and left the house at about 6:30 am.  Approximately 2 miles down the Chazy Lake Road, headed toward the Town of Saranac, is where I had my sighting. A ditch (approximately 3 feet wide and 2 feet deep)runs along side of the road.  There was probably a foot of snow on the ground.  As I was driving, I saw something dark stand up from inside the ditch and head into the woods.  When I saw it, it was probably 150-200 yards in front of me.  It appeared to have a human shape but was slouched over.  I could not tell the height nor could I give an approximate weight.  The sighting lasted probably no more than 5 seconds.  I saw the upper 2/3 of its body which appeared to be dark brown or black in color.  I told my wife about it that night and we joked about it for a bit saying it must have been Bigfoot.  In all honesty, I thought I had either seen or bear or my eyes were playing tricks on me.

They both headed into the woods in opposite directions.  The ran quite fast slightly bent at the waist.  When we arrived at the point where we saw them, there was no sign of them.

    "   In August of 1996 myself and six friends were camping at Pine Pond in the lower Saranac Lake region.  It was around dusk and my friend and I were fishing in our canoe. The other members of our party were at camp preparing supper, about a quarter mile away through the forest from our location on the canoe in the middle of the lake. My friend and I were speaking openly, not attempting to be quiet in any way. I was scanning the northern bank of the lake, which I knew quite well, when I noticed a strange shape on the edge of the wood line. It was about 50 yards away. Immediately I pointed it out to my friend and he spotted it instantly. The shape was about 3 1/2 feet off of the ground at its highest point. At first we both thought it was a black bear standing broadside but after a few seconds I realized that was not the case. We started to row towards it somewhat cautiously.  Just as my friend whispered \"it''s a bear\" the thing stood up. It had been crouching there on its feet like a catcher from a baseball team. It was about seven feet tall and was very dark brown in color. Its face was hairy yet fleshy around the upper cheeks. Its eyes were dark in color but clearly visible and had a brightness about them.  Upon talking afterwards, we both agreed that we saw slight movements of its head and hands. It stood there for what seemed like ten seconds looking at us. It tilted its head slightly up as if it were sniffing the air. As if all this wasn''t strange enough, we then heard the snapping twigs about fifty feet behind it. The creature turned its torso to the left and looked to its side.  It immediately turned back towards us and then spun 180 degrees around and darted into the wood line like a cat. We then heard the sound of movement for about ten more seconds then we heard nothing. To this day I have no idea what made the noise behind it. After staying put in the canoe for about ten minutes my friend decided (against my wishes) paddle to the spot on shore and investigate for tracks.  There were only two discernable markings in the sand which were obscured from the pivoting of its feet when it turned around. The whole experience was very, very upsetting.  Although I can honestly say it did not attempt to threaten us in anyway it was scary as hell. That night I did not sleep one wink because I was so focused on every little noise that I heard. The next day we left.  The other people in our party are convinced we saw a bear. It was no bear.",

    " My memory of this is a bit foggy, as I was I believe seven when it happened and am 37 now. At the time my family was living in Cazenovia NY. I would often hike way out in the swamps behind our house with a friend to make forts etc. We would tear the bark off of dead elm trees to make paths for what seemed like very long distances. One day a friend and I were quite a distance out in the swamp chopping away at a rotted fallen tree with hammers when we heard a loud noise. Looking around we saw a very large, dark form that appeared to be a man walking through the swamp very near us. I will never forget the surge of adrenalin and abject fear that I felt. We dropped everything and turned and ran as fast as possible home without looking back. My parents were angry as I had left a hammer there. I refused to go back for quite a while until my older brother accompanied me. I didn''t think about this incident too much over the years until later when I have heard people describe bigfoot sightings in terms of ''It looked like a very big man wearing a black raincoat''. This is exactly the description I would give. I don''t know, it just seems odd. Why would a man have been alone out in a swamp like that and never said a word to us? Makes you wonder.",

    " I was driving from my grandparents house to my girlfriends house one night in early fall at about 10 pm.  The area I was heading to is up in Tughill plateau which is a very dense wooded area.  I was about 2 miles outside my hometown of Sandy Creek and had about 3 miles of woods to drive through to reach Boyelston, where my girlfriend lived. The road I was traveling on was very narrow with steep banks on both sides.  I had just made a left turn around a corner where the road begins to get steeper and head uphill for about a mile when I saw something beside the road out of the corner of my right eye.  I started to slow down out of instinct because people are always hitting deer around this area when this thing just jumped out into the road in front of me and began to quickly cross to the other side.  I slammed on the brakes and skidded to a stop, which gave me just enough time to see some of it in my headlights as it finished crossing the road and up the bank into the woods and disappeared.<BR>I only really saw it from the side and the back so my description isn''t really any different from any you may have heard.  It was somewhere between 6 1/2 and 7 feet tall and very strongly built.  Its head seemed to be attached to its shoulders directly because I couldn''t see a neck.  But it had very long dark hair, mainly black with patches of brown.  I can''t believe I originally thought it was a deer.",

    " This is a follow up to my original message as I wanted to add some significant insight to an incident that occurred to me in 1960 at age 14. As I stated previously stated I was a caddy at the time and the foursome I was with was just walking off the green of hole 13 on the private course Club in Syracuse, New York.  As I was walking across the green to replace the pin I heard something falling through a tree directly across from me. You could hear it pass through the tree as the boulder made its descent to the ground. The large rock almost hitting one of the golfers. There was much consternation over this and it was automatically assumed that it came as a result of blasting at General Crushed Stone located behind the golf course on Rock Cut Road. I never heard a blast but there could be no other explanation as large rocks don''t just fall out of the sky. However, the rock being hurled into the air by a dynamite blast at the quarry just doesn''t hold up in many ways. First off my friend''s father worked at the quarry at the time and he said blasting was not large enough to propel a single rock that far as the charges used to quarry the limestone were not that great. Plus this was a single large boulder if it was a blast there would be a shotgun type of pattern of smaller rocks with it, not just one rock sailing into the air. Secondly, the rock that I saw was not a freshly quarried rock which would be gray in color this rock was a surficial rock that was stained from the soil it did not come from a blast site. The boulder was at least 20 pounds in weight and 4\" by 8\" and 3\" thick. It was flat on the top and bottom and stained a yellow brown color as is common of rocks on the surface in that area. However, this rock came down out of the sky vertically as you could tell by the sound of it falling through the entire tree, cutting branches and leaves as it fell it had to have been lifted quite high into the air to come down vertically like it did. It did not smash into the tree on a horizontal trajectory and bounce off the tree. As I stated previously at the end of the game I met up with my friend  who lived on Rock Cut Road at the time as we were going swimming in the spring fed wash ponds at the quarry. The way to get there was to go back to hole 13 and cross the fence into General Crushed Stone property. We were trespassing which at the time we didn''t acknowledge.  We stopped and I showed my friend the rock that came out of the sky and both of us believed that it had to have been a blast at the quarry.  We walked on down a grade on a path and that is when we heard a guttural growl off to our left. It was a fearsome growl and I for one shot off down the hill as fast as I could go. We assumed it was an animal. However, what animal growls at a human when the human is not confronting it or even knows it is there? I don''t know of any and I certainly don''t know what type of animal living in Central New York would or could make itself know in a threatening manner. Normally animals of all type will shun and form of human contact or confrontation. This occurred no more than 100 feet from where the rock had landed under the tree. Plus if you were to place a clock face over the tree that the rock fell through and draw a line out from where the rock had landed which was between the 3 and the 5 those two lines would encompass the vicinity of where the growl came from. As I have stated I never saw anything out of the ordinary and was certainly not aware of \"Bigfoot\" or anything like it being seen in New York State. I had heard of the \"Abominable Snowman\" but that was worlds away. I can''t say this is a \"Bigfoot\" encounter, however, two events occurred that is very similar to what others have experienced in Bigfoot sightings. The large rock being hurled at individuals and done so to scare more than injury plus the deep growl the likes of which I had never heard before or since and couldn''t to this day equate it to one particular animal. The only thing I am sure of is two events separated in time by only a couple of hours still stand out in my mind these many years later as if they occurred today.  ",

    "      The incident occured in 1985-86 not sure which.  A friend and I went into the woods to stay the night in a cabin by a small creek that my friends brother had built.  The cabins floor was about two feet off the ground to prevent flooding.  It was about 11:00 pm when my friend and I heard someone at the door which we had locked.  Someone was trying to get in.  When we asked who was there, no one answered.  Whoever or whatever it was moved around to the side of the cabin where the window was.  All we saw was a shape in the window.  The top of the figures head reached almost to the top of the window, which I estimated to be some 8 feet off the ground outside.  We were terrified beyond belief.  We huddled in a corner not getting a wink of sleep all night.  The next morning we cautiously went outside to investigate.  The ground was frozen with patches of snow that were riddled with footprints from everyone the day before.  It wasnt until I crossed the stream that I noticed a set of footprints that looked like someone had walked barefoot up the side of a steep embankment that ran along side the creek.  I called my friend over to look.  The stride was to wide for either of us to make especially since they were going up the embankment.  We just figured that someone had come in the middle of the night to mess with us.  At the time there were snow shoes that looked like a big version of someones bare foot circulating department stores.  I guess neither of us wanted to believe that it could''ve been anything else.  To this day no one has confessed to trying to scare us that night.  It just makes me wonder.",

    " My unusual experience occurred during the first week of October 2005. I was scouting for deer in a very isolated and limited access area in upstate New York accessible by a 4 x 4 trail. I had scouted another area earlier during the day and had about 2 hours of good daylight left to scout this area. <BR><BR>My standard practice is to drive the entire length of the valley to check the parking areas as to see where other hunters are located before scouting. <BR><BR>On this day, like most during pre archery and archery season, I was the only person and vehicle on the 4000 acres. I turned around and headed back up the valley to where I wanted to scout. It was a nice sunny fall day but the sun was beginning to drop. I parked my truck, grabbed my backpack, and headed down a steep ravine into a creek bed. I crossed the creek and proceeded up the other side of the wooded ravine. There is a field at the top of the ravine that I crossed and a hedgerow that separated a hidden field on top.  I wanted to check some apple trees for apples. <BR><BR>On the far side of the hidden field is a large pile for rocks that appear to be the foundation of an old homestead. I usually climb on top of the rock pile because it is high enough for me to glass the entire field to the top, which is a couple hundred yards. I glassed the field and saw nothing, which is odd for that time of day but not unheard of. A deer trail crosses in front of the rock pile and heads into a marsh area with a thicket on the backside of the marsh. The thicket is a few hundred yards wide then breaks into a mature open hardwood where I wanted to scout for a tree stand location.<BR><BR>I was about halfway across the marsh when I heard a very loud, deep, resonating growl or roar. It stopped me dead in my tracks and came from the thicket I was headed into about 100 yards away. I have never heard anything in the woods in my 25 years of hunting like it. It was not a cat, coyote, dog, and I do not think a bear. I did see a very large bear the season before in this area at 20 yards but he did not make a sound when I waved him off. He just stood up and looked at me then turned and ran off about 50 yards before walking again. I had a rifle at the time and the bear did not see me until I waved at him. He was walking straight down the mountain at me where I was sitting on stand next to a huge boulder. One year I did spook a bear out of a small orchard and he kind of \"woofed\" at me as left the area. But this sound wasn''t anything like a \"woof\" it was more of a roar that lasted about 1 to 1.5 seconds. I was shocked and taken back by it.<BR><BR>After stopping dead in my tracks I spotted a big flat rock a few feet away. I climbed up on the rock and took my pack off. What ever made the noise was very large so I dug out my hunting knife and put it on my belt. I usually carry a sidearm when scouting but they are not allowed in this area. That day I wish I had one with me. I glassed the thicket with my binoculars but I could not see anything that could have made the sound. After about 5 minutes of looking, I wrote it off as a bear and decided to change direction and go check another field that is over the hill from the field I crossed to get to the marsh but at other end of that field.<BR><BR>I started walking up the marsh parallel to the thicket and to my surprise and shock; whatever was in the thicket was walking parallel to me or flanking my right side. I could hear it snapping limbs and twigs as it walked. This was something heavy at least the size of a deer, bear, or person. I never heard anything scamper or scurry in the leaves like a small animal will eventually do if you listen long enough. I could hear it busting through the saplings. At this point I decided to get out of the marsh and into 75 to 100 yard wide hedgerow and that runs between the field I crossed and the marsh. This also would lead me away from the thicket. I could not hear whatever was in the thicket after I got into the hedgerow.<BR><BR>I was about in the middle of the hedgerow on an old logging road that runs parallel to the field I crossed to get to the marsh when I ran across something odd. There were two trees about 20 to 25 feet in height bent completely over and parallel to the ground across the logging road. The trees were a good 4 to 5 inches in diameter. There was no obvious damage to the trees and the trees were alive with green leaves on them. I kept walking up the hedgerow and toward the field at the top.<BR><BR>I arrived at the top of the hill and top of the field I had crossed to get into the marsh. There is a hedgerow that separates the two fields. I glassed the second field for a few minutes and saw nothing. I had yet to see any kind of wildlife on this scouting trip. The sun was starting to get very low in the sky so I decided to start heading back to my truck. I knew if I followed the top hedgerow down the hill I would pass a couple apple trees and it would lead me to the top of the ravine. I kept following the hedgerow down the hill until I almost reached the top of the ravine. I stopped to check for deer sign around a couple of apple trees. As I was looking for sign, I heard a series of \"knocking\" noises coming from about the area where I crossed the ravine on my trip up into the fields. I would estimate the knocking was 200 to 250 yards away. It was not a woodpecker because the time between knocks was too long and it was a more dulled whack rather than a hollow sound a woodpecker makes. A woodpecker has an almost machine gun sound to it. I heard a series of about 4 or 5 knocks then 20 seconds later another series and then another series.<BR><BR>At this point, I got kind of spooked because it seemed whatever was in the thicket had backtracked me to where I had crossed the creek and ravine at the start of my scouting trip. The sun was starting to set behind the mountain and it was going to start to get dark quickly. I was literally miles from any main road or person and in the middle of nowhere. If whatever was backtracking me continued to do so, then we were going to end up at the same place, my truck. My original plan was to walk the top of the ravine back down to where I had crossed the first time because it is easier to climb back up the hill.  Well, that is where I was hearing the knocking noise coming from so I decided I didn''t want to get any closer to the source of the knocking. <BR><BR>I headed straight down the side of the ravine into the creek bottom. It much darker in the creek bottom and everything was in shades of gray. I stopped for a moment to catch my breath before I started up the other side of the ravine to my truck. As I was standing there catching my breath, I started hearing rocks landing on the rocks in the creek bed a couple of hundred yards downstream from me. I could not tell if they were rolling down the hill and landing on the rocks in the creek bed or being thrown. I could hear the rocks land on other rocks and roll around a bit. This happened 5 or 6 times.<BR><BR>After hearing this, I just headed straight up the other side of the ravine grabbing trees to pull myself up and got out of there as quickly as possible. I hit the jeep trail about 75 yards above where I parked. I made a beeline for my truck, dumped my pack in the passenger side and drove out of there as quickly as I could and the trail would let me. It was four wheel drive low range all the way out. I kept checking in my side and rearview mirrors for anything on the road behind me. I never saw anything on the road behind me.<BR><BR>Was it a bigfoot? I can''t say that. I can say that I have never heard a roar or growl like that in the woods. I researched the Internet on animal vocalizations but could not find anything that was an exact match. The closest match was a snarling wolf but it was not the sound I heard. I listened to the bigfoot vocalizations on this site and can not say that is what I heard either. The thing roared or growled once and it was kind of short. It startled me and I didn''t get a second chance to hear it. After reading some of the reports on this site, the unusual events that occurred that day match other people''s experiences. There are also reports on this site that are from the same area as I was scouting. I was back in the area again during gun season 6 weeks later and did not see or experience anything unusual. I usually don''t spook very easy and travel the backcountry alone quite often. I will admit, that day I was spooked by something.<BR>",

    "Since then, a couple other incidents might be worth a mention that I didn''t think of till hearing some of the \"vocalizations\" recorded.This last summer heard some sort of a light growl gutterly noise around the house. It was late mid summer and had the house all opened up for cool air. We live a ways away from people and could leave the house open at night without a problem. This noise creeped me out. I had never heard anything in the area like that before. I turned on all floods and spotlight flashlight around the house. I went outside and walked around the entire house spotlighting in hopes of seeing wha tmade that noise as it sounded like it was within 50 feet of the house. I found nothing.The year before in mid summer again I heard this \"howl\" that was bigger than any howl from any dog. We got a pond near by and it sounded like it came from the pound but I wanted to see this \"dog\". We''ve all heard big dogs bark and you know when the dog is pushing 100 pounds just by the sound of his bark amplified by size of cheast. This howl went right through me it was so massive. I''d have to say it was a 200 pound plus dog and didn''t put anything to it until I heard some the vocalization recordings. It was very similar to them. I couldn''t what it was now..... I initially thought dog but now I just don''t know. Whatever made it ...... well i''d say it was the biggest animal I''d ever heard in the woods EVER.Never heard anything like that before or since.",

    " I submitted this report, I thing back in october(i think) and did not see anything posted or had any contact and omitted my phone number as no one in my household has been told of this story but will resubmit fully.<BR><BR>I''m unsure of exact year but I had returned to the area in june of 2000 and I think it happened the following fall of 2000 or 2001. Me and a buddy(him driving) were out driving backroads spotting deer as it was near hunting season if I recall correctly. We often drove the backroads out here doing just that......spotting wildlife.<BR><BR>It was roughly around 1AM.<BR><BR>We were heading south on Foster Valley Road in Tioga county New York and approaching one of the main country roads(Day Hollow Road) and were within 1/2 mile of it......or there abouts, traveling about 30mph. As we were approaching the S''s we could see the approaching lights of an oncoming car. Their headlights would have shined away to the uphill side (east side) of the road and they might not have even seen the creature due to location, light direction and visible location in the turns. We passed the car at about the same time we passed the creature and the headlights kind of obsured my vision of the creature but my buddy was focused on it and says he was not so bad and he probably got a more vivid look than I did as i lost good clear vision due to eye adjusting to the oncoming glare.<BR><BR>The road is a bit windy and as your approaching Day Hollow there is a couple of slight switch back \" S \" turns. When heading south, right along that section there is a very steap bank at road edge to your right side with no guardrail and bank at it''s highest might be 15 feet and drops down to a slightly tree''d slightly open flat so to speak. A person could easily jump from the road and land in the flat it is that steap.<BR><BR>The S turns are just about as perfectly inbetween the two closest houses to the area. <BR><BR>There are NO street lights in that section and a very dark section it is.<BR><BR>Due to the direction we were traveling and location of the headlights. Well we could see \"something/someone\" standing right on the edge of the road but on the bank. This bank is extemely short and steap. I would think it be a challenge for any person to stand or climb that bank but here is what we thought of as a person standing right there.<BR><BR>It was DIRECTLY infront of us and we could see that it was looking at the other approaching car even though it''s headlights were not even close to being fixed on it. We spotted this \"person\" probably around 50 yards away so we had some time to try and focus.<BR><BR>Even though the encounter actually happened within a short time frame I can look back on it as if it was slow motion and is permanently engrained in my mind.<BR><BR>As we approached this creature we didn''t realize what it was or how big it really was till just after passing it.<BR><BR>The comments inside the truck were kinda humorous and no offense is intended towards anyone peron inparticular but kind of go along with the sighting. Now the location of this thing in relation to the road and time of occurance was quite quite a dangerous spot for a \"person\" and most people would have probably stepped back away from the road but keeping in mind one step back is about 6 feet down easy.<BR><BR>The comments as we approached were with some explitives and without being offensive here something like.....<BR><BR>Holy cow, what kind of idiot would be standing there dressed in all black hooded sweatshirt.<BR><BR>I don''t know but they better step back. <BR><BR>Damn it looks like one BIG woman(torso completely visible and appeared large chested with what I''d figure as breasts)<BR><BR>Ya and why she all dressed in dark with a hooded sweatshirt on(looking back on it now I''d give a smoked charcol dark grey)<BR><BR>Damn they better step back if they don''t wanna get hit(we actually slowed a bit due to oncoming car and passing at location of creature so we needed the full road and edge of shoulder to pass the car)<BR><BR>The creature seemed to be looking more at the other vehicle and didn''t turn to look at us till we were just about to hit/pass. She wasn''t maybe five feet from the side of the truck and I looked her in the face out the side window as passing.<BR><BR>At that moment we both got a decent look at her face. When she turned to look at us she kind of turned her torso and body with the head to do so.<BR><BR>She was obviously big and even though she was standing on the bank, i''d have to say that we saw about 5 feet of the creature from about waist to high upper upper on up and looking back on it now and knowing the bank that she probably had about 4 feet we couldn''t see below the bank edge.<BR><BR>Her arms wer almost to the level of the road.<BR><BR>As we passed and got a glimps of her face the comments continued and were something like.......<BR><BR>OH MY GOD is she butt ugly.<BR><BR>Ya she is, she had a pig face, did you see that snout of a nose(there was no snout at all but a large very wide open nostraled slightly upturned nose).<BR><BR>Man is she ugly, she looks like she got beat with a couple ugly sticks out here in the woods.<BR><BR>Ya she sure as hell has one hell of an ape face.<BR><BR>At that moment, with the ape face comment. both of us turned to each other to see the expression on each others faces as the realization of what we may have just passed WAS.<BR><BR>We did not turn around. we did not go back to look ...... I honestly didn''t want to.<BR><BR>The reason I say hooded sweat shirt is..... well we''ve all seen people with one on and we all know how they kind of have a pointed head where the hood is sown together. well she had the same kind of coned head. We didn''t realize we were looking at hair and not a sweat shirt. She had a humanish face but man for a human she was very very hampered in the looks department.<BR><BR>She was definitely what I would call breasted and large roundish belly and large torso and had to be all of 8 feet if not bigger.<BR><BR>",

    " My wife and I have had our farm near Treadwell, NY in Delaware County since the summer of 2001. The farm is above 130 mostly wooded acres (I don''t want to give the exact number of acres to avoid someone figuring out which one it is), with about 30 acres of fields, with a few trails throughout the woods. The property is bordered by probably 2,000 or more acres of continuous woods (privately owned), and countless more acres of woods and fields that lead all the way up to Canada by just crossing dirt roads, except for one major highway (88). I have had a fascination for Bigfoot since I was young, and read about reported sightings, etc., so I am keen to notice things that could be attributed to these possible creatures others might not notice. I say possible creatures because even though I have a strong feeling they exist, I have not seen one with my own eyes. The first thing that happened was not long after we got our place. We were sitting around a campfire we made not far from the house, when we began to hear the sound of wood being pounded against wood coming from what seemed to be our woods up on the hill. The distance up to those particular woods is probably 300 yards or more, but this sound was clear and strong. I told my wife what I thought it could be and she told me she didnt want to hear anymore about it because it frightened her. There was no other explanation that could explain that distinct sound to me though. I tried to duplicate the sound in the woods myself, but could get nowhere near the resonance that must have been produced to carry the distance I think we heard it from. On another occasion I took our dog out for his nightly walk, and heard a tremendous short howl/scream/yelp with a whole lot of modulation. It gave me a chill down my spine. It was just a huge sound. We have coyotes all around here and I have heard them make some strange sounds, but I have never heard that sound from a coyote. Whatever made that sound I would imagine had to be a pretty big animal. It did not seem far away either, so after shinning the flashlight along the edge of the woods, I hightailed back to the house checking over my shoulder often. Perhaps along this same line, my wife was out with the dog one early evening in the field, and this is the mildest dog you will ever encounter, it has only ever growled while asleep and chasing something in its dreams. My wife told me that she had never seen our dog behave this way, and it doesnt even pay attention to deer when it sees them anymore because it sees them so often. The dog was looking intently at something along the wood line and growling. My wife could see nothing, but the dog saw something that scared it. It may have been a bear, as I have seen tracks and sign occasionally? The last incident, and probably the most convincing to me are the tracks that we saw in our woods this past winter (2004). We have never been able to get into our woods in the winter because the snow has always been too deep, and the hill to those particular woods to steep. The snowshoes that we tried in the past just sunk in the powdery snow. We tried a new type on a snow with an ice crust and we were able to get into the woods for quite a ways. We came across a trail of two pairs of tracks going in a couple of different directions and meeting up again a hundred yards or so later that no humans could have made. I at first I thought the tracks could have been made by deer leaping, but the tracks appeared to be a two legged stride with one foot pointing a little right and one a little left alternating perfectly. I am 6 feet tall, and I took my snowshoes off to see what king of stride I could make, and I was about a foot or two short of reaching the stride of these prints. The prints were pretty old as they had been snowed on, so I couldnt see much, and tried to feel for features like toes, but could not say for sure that I felt any. They were quite long, but the snow could have melted to make them bigger? What struck us was the length of the stride though.<BR><BR>So, that is our experience to this point for what its worth. I only wanted to let you know that there could be something to these incidences. I would not dare ask my neighbors if they have had any strange thing happen, even though they are very good friends of ours. I find it ironic that they may have had more significant encounters and may be afraid to say anything to us about it. One neighbor did say they heard what sounded like a dear being attacked and screaming in the woods in the night. They have never heard anything like it, so that was their only explanation. One of them works for an environmental agency that I wont identify and spends a lot of time in the woods. <BR>",

I peered through the thicket and all I could see was the hump of its'' back as it pounded its'' head or shoulder against the tree.  It was large.  I was so very curious to see more that I walked up onto our mound so I could look down into the thicket.  I could not see it better but it must have picked up my sent or seen me because it ran toward me.  I could hear it running and growling.  It hit some downed trees and could not catch up to me....I heard it hit the trees as I was running to my back door.   I am not crazy.  I am an educated woman.  I know what I experienced.  I have contacted the DNR of Wisconsin from where I live now because I just have not been able to get the experience out of my mind...it haunts me.  The DNR said it could not have been a bear.

    " I witnessed a Sasquatch at about 225 yards distance for approximately 15 seconds, while it traveled around 75 yards along the back of a stone quarry near Middleport, NY in the Fall of 2002/September. <BR><BR>I stop there to look for deer in a large field behind the quarry that are always there and immediately noticed when I exited my truck a dark biped moving very rapidly through waist high field grass on very uneven rocky terrain. <BR><BR>It seemed to float through the grass as I could not see its legs due to the height of the grass it moved through. Immediately I noticed that it was completely the same color and it seemed to hold its arms at its side as it moved very, very quickly from left to right. <BR><BR>At first sight I thought it was a girl with very long hair but quickly noticed that it was completely the same color with no obvious clothes coloration and moved much too fast although at the distance I was I could not make out any actual features and at no time did it look in my direction, but I believe I startled this creature by pulling into the stone driveway which makes considerable noise. <BR><BR>As it crossed a path next to a corn field and angled slightly away from me I noticed that its glutteal area was somewhat lighter colored. The biped then moved directly into a standing corn field and was not seen after that time. When I say traveled very quickly, I mean it was really moving very rapidly but at no time did it seem like it was running as you or I would look if traveling at that speed due to fact that there was no discernable movement of its arms as it \"floated\" through the tall grass. <BR><BR>I am convinced that this was a sasquatch I witnessed as I have been an avid outdoorsman since a very young age, hunting, hiking and camping for over 40 years and very experienced with animals in the wild and I know what I saw that afternoon was remarkable.",

With the time being around 2:00am in the morning, there were no sounds of any traffic or industrial sounds. The weather was excellent; no clouds, not the slightest breeze. My girlfriend and I had turned in for bed at around 1:30-1:45 am. We were talking to each other, just little chit chat when we both heard a far off howl/moan! At that time of night and that there was no wind to disturb the trees and hamper what we heard, it sounded like it came from the south maybe a mile or a mile and a half. The sound started low and kept going up in pitch for about 5 seconds. We both looked at each other and said \"What the hell was that?!\" Now what really freaked us out is that it did it again, only at around 6-7 seconds! It was like, \"Ooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh-----\"<BR>   Now I consider myself an excellent observer with a very keen ear. I can hear things that most people either don''t, or just overlook. What we heard was NOT anything mechanical nor was it a whistle. It sounded like it traveled over some distance; not like it was down the street. I am very fimiliar with all kinds of traffic noises that are associated with small towns. Even before we had heard it, we both had noticed how silent it was for quite some time.<BR>   After the howl/moan, there was an echo. The sound went up in scale and didn''t go down like a siren or anything like that. It wasn''t a cry for help or a wolf nor any coyote (I have heard a coyote three times, once from only 200 yards)",

    " This was years ago. I''m 38 now, but when this happened I was 14. My father worked with a guy who had some prime property in Naples, NewYork. Being that I was 14, I was not old enough to have a hunters license. So my father let me go with him, and I had the task of pushing the deer to him.<BR><BR>We got to the property just before daylight, Dad went about 200 yards up the the road, and I went the opposite way, and went into the woods. It started getting light out, and I remember that it was real cold that morning. It had snowed the day before but there was only patches of snow on the ground. <BR><BR>I had been walking through some thick sections of brush and was getting tired. I was walking in a shallow gully with a 20ft ridge on both sides of me. I walked up the ridge (I believe) to my left. There was a large tree laying down, so I sat down with my back against it. I could see pretty clear, the whole area. I guess I dozed off for a bit. I woke up, hearing what sounded like a large branch had snapped. I looked to my right, and then to my left, but as I looked to my left (paning the view) I saw something on the the oppisite ridge across from me. There was this large dark figure just standing there turned my way. It had heavy fur like hair all over it. I could''nt make out a face because it had long tangled hair hanging down. Now this figure was maybe 30 ft away give or take. Being cold as it was, I remember it breathing through the hair in front of its face (that really creeped me out). I sat there up against that tree with my heart racing out of my chest, afraid to move. This went on for minutes, feeling like a lifetime.Then all of a sudden it took one step torwards me (I think it was its left leg).That''s when I jumped up, turned, and ran as fast as I could. <BR><BR>I remember, I had run into a high fence line earlier that morning, that took my some time to scale. Well I jumped through this area of the fence from total terror of what might be chasing me. I managed to get to the road and ran full sprint to the car which was a ways down the road. The car was locked. Thats when I looked around, but nothing was after me (thank god). I waited about 2 hours and finally saw my dad walking down the road. He was pretty upset with me leaving the woods as early as I had but I told him what happened, and what I saw, and he did''nt believe any of it. He figured I was just cold and tired making it up. <BR><BR>I had never even heard of bigfoot when I was 14. I didnt know what it was, but I know for a fact that it wasn''t a bear.This figure was dark brown but lighter colored around its shoulders and thighs. Its arms were, I thought, too long for its body. I figure it was at least between 7 to 9 foot tall. It had to weigh 4 or 500 lbs. at least. <BR><BR>From reading some of your articles, people have said it smelled bad, but I didnt smell any odor that I remember.",

    " Hi, in the end of Jan. 2003 my wife and I were spotlighting for deer and coyotes in Waterport NY.  We were driving my 4x4 truck through the apple orchards. The lane went through a large hedge row with a small stream in it. When we got to the other side we spot-lighted along the woods. About 75 to 100 yards there is an old spot they use to dump garbage.  There was something standing next to the old fridge. I have hunted these woods since I was a little boy and never had seen anything like this. Its belly was about the top of an almost 6 foot tall fridge. I know it was an animal because its eyes reflected in the spotlight. It looked almost like a bear standing on its hind feet but there is no bears in this part of the state. As we sat there trying to figure out what it was it started to turn and walk into the woods. Wince we didn''t have any weapons on us we just got the hell out of there.",

    " My family had moved from the city of Rochester to Wolcott, a small town about 50 miles east of Rochester in July 2003. We were living in an old farmhouse on approx. 77 acres of woods & creeks near Lake Ontario. This incident happened sometime between the 18th-20th of September. My sister''s birthday is the 20th and I recall a small group of family and friends were visiting the house for that occasion. My future-stepfather took a small group, including his brother, my four sisters, and a few other friends out for a \"tour\" of the property. I was not present, I had stayed behind at the house. As the group returned to the house, my stepfather lingered behind in an area of the property where a strip of woods runs between two fields. My stepfather was in the field closer to the house, we''ll refer to it as field #1. He noticed to his left something in the woods and turned to see a tall, white, hair covered creature standing just off the path in the woods. He ran ahead and told his brother, but did not tell the rest of the group. His brother rushed into the house to get me, telling me that something was in the woods and I should come see. I followed him outside where my stepfather relayed the story to me and the three of us walked back to the area of his sighting. As my stepfather showed me the spot where the creature had been standing, we all noticed that the creature was still present, but had moved further back, to field #2. At this point, the three of us were standing in field 1 and looking through a small strip of trees at the creature in field 2, maybe 200 yards away or so. My observations of the creature are as follows: It was approximately 7'' tall, covered in hair, white but with a dark area on the face, think and lanky, with a head that came to a slight conic shape. It was too far to distinctly see its face but there was a definite darker colored area where the face would have been. The creature was clearly observing us, as it paced back and forth, looking around trees, standing up taller, ducking down, etc. to get a better look at us. After approximately 45 seconds, the creature retreated to an area where we couldn''t see it clearly. I walked through the trees into field 2 to get a better look at it, but it had disappeared. The area where it had been walking was matted down, but there were no distinct prints. Judging by nearby trees, I estimated its height to be 6.5 - 7 feet. ",
    :environment
    "The environment is a large wooded area on the outskirts of civilization. At the time, my family owned approx. 77 acres of land, most of which was woods and fields. My family''s house and barn were approximately 500 yards from the sighting area. Lake Ontario is within walking distance (on a clear day it is visible from the sighting spot) and there is a large creek (Mudge Creek) running through the area. There is a vineyard across the street. There are other houses scattered on the street but nothing particularly close. The area is rather isolated. The nearest town is a 10-minute drive and the nearest highway about 15 minutes.",

    " First let me state I am a college educated person with two degrees.  One in psychology and one in fine art.  Like many persons who have had this type of unexplained experience, it has made a mark on my psyche that has been permanently etched despite the ridicule poured on me (by persons who in fact were not there). Scientifically one may NOT deny or affirm the existence of a thing about which we have little information.  For instance, in the 1600''s if one were to speak of electricity and television they would be deemed mad and a witch.  Now you read this by just such means as were previously thought non-sense.  We know it is fact now.  Some day, I believe, this rare ape will present us with irrefutable evidence of it''s existence like being a little too slow in front of a mack truck or something.  Enough of that.<BR>Here''s why you''re reading this...<BR><BR>In the winter of 2001 while surfing the net for images of \"western art paintings\" the BFRO web site popped up with Western New York Bigfoot Sightings.  I had to laugh.  You gotta be kidding me.  Then to make it even better there are these \"listen to the bigfoot\" wave/sound files to download.  So curiousity made me do it.  I''m laughing my butt off here.  So I hit play.  <BR><BR>Suddenly I shut up  -   I am in SHOCK.  My hands began to shake and the adrenaline glands almost blew my head off.  The sound of the \"howl\" is exactly what I encountered one evening the previous September of 2000.  So now I play the other \"scream\" file.  Alright, now I''m disturbed.  That too I heard within 100 yards of my home that same summer, about 5-6 times on different occasions.<BR><BR>I never had any thoughts about sasquatch before.  This gave me pause.  It suddenly gave me a flashback of living near the Tonawanda creek in upstate New York and seeing a large (12-15\") barefoot footprint in the snow along the creek/riverbank just upstream of the north pembroke hotel(magadore hilton,ha).  Barefoot in the snow ? What kind of a jerk does that ?  There were, I believe, four of us kids there.  I was about 11 or 12 at the time.  We often played in those woods however that day we had an uneasy feeling and cut our trip very short and went immediately home.  I thought maybe it was a bear track like a hind foot although I knew it was too human.  No one even mentioned Bigfoot, it was not something we ever talked about.  Now that memory is freaky.<BR><BR>And there''s more..<BR>I now live in the woods and am very comfortable here near Allegeny State Park.  There are literally thousands of acres of forrest surrounding my home.  I am comfortable chasing 350 pound black bears out of my yard, sitting in the woods and having coyotes walk by, hearing screach owls etc.  THIS sound was unlike anything I had ever heard.  Sometimes at the approach of archery season I need to convince disrespectful persons that no tresspassing actually means them.  This night I thought to encounter a coon hunter whose howling dog was moving towards my position down through the valley.  The sound wasn''t just right for a baying dog but what else could it be ???  Now at the time this howling started it was probably a mile off (more later) and at dusk/dark.<BR><BR> I have the pleasure of having a wolf-dog that is not too much pooch you might say.  Great animal, very mellow even when on walks at night and the coyotes start up yapping less that 100yrs away.  He just looks and say''s \"punks\" and moves on - nothing phases him.  This night he was like stone focused on the direction of the loooooong howl.( I get the creeps remembering it).  Never before or since have I seen him in that state even in the presence of black bears.  His ears were fixed and I had to drag him under protest back into my cabin.  I was afraid that he might attack an expensive coon dog when I confronted the ''hunter''.  So now the wolf is in the house and I leash up my german sheperd, grab a spot light and a very serious russian weapon.  I take off in the direction of this howl which I can tell is coming toward me and know there is a field which leads up into the woods near where we should meet.  I get about 80 yrds in that direction and notice that the howling is now going to pass above me in the woods so I redirect my course for a more appropriate intersection point.<BR> <BR>Normally my sheperd is pretty bloodthirsty which I do not encourage, just her nature.  Tonight she is cowering between my legs trying to pull me back home to safety.  I''m thinkin'' \"wimp dog !!!\" and she''s really making me angry.  I am looking for the coon hunter''s tell tale spot light in the tree tops or through the woods -nothing.  Meanwhile I have entered into the thick of the woods cresting an embankment of about 35 feet above the road.  Oh Boy !  That aint no dog.  What the ----- weapon''s up laser sight on - this is bad.  When you have an attack dog, a nasty weapon with o so many bullets and a spot light (which started to go out, thankyou very much) and you''re still scared.  You just make sure the safety is off and focus on that little red dot.  <BR><BR> The thing was traveling at such a speed through the woods it didn''t seem real.  I thought the dog had to be running but when I heard it from around 120 yards away on the same level, NOBODY could convince you it was a dog, wolf, coyote etc.<BR>  I don''t scare easy, that was terror.<BR>Still I never thought \"bigfoot\".  In fact I researched all the wolf sounds I could find and none of them matched what I heard the night before.  I thought that is why my critter was so interested.<BR>  I just chalked it up to a \"maybe wolf\".  A neighbor who is about 85% deaf and a true hermit woodsman (83 years old) asked ME if I heard \"that howling the other night\".  This guy could almost sleep through an atomic bomb. Another fellow who is a Korean war vet who saw too much action also told me about this strange howling he heard two seperate nights.  He stated that he intentionally stayed up one night to see if he could figure out what it was.  He said that he could never figure out the noise or creature that made it.  Understand that this guy has camped out in a tent or camper in these woods for over 15 years.  Frankly he''s seen or heard almost everything around here.  Yet another neighbor ask me about the noise.  Her first comment was,\"It seemed a lot louder than it should have.\"  Now know that she owns a kennel and is an accomplished singer musician.  Let''s just say she understands acoustics.  Incidentally there is a great deer trail just about where I believe this noisy beast to have traversed the valley.<BR>",

    " I saw one in Napoli, NY, by Sawmill Run Rd. It was October 2000. My dad and I were hunting turkey on state land we were walking slow and quietly stopping and looking around. We were about 20 yards apart and we were both looking SE. I turned slowly and didn''t see anything, but then did see movement in front of me. I pulled up my gun, ready for a turkey. It was about 20 yards away and I didn''t shoot. I didn''t know what it was. It was on two legs, all brown-red hair all over it and at least six feet tall. It took off running like a big guy, but swift. It ran down hill away from me and was out of sight. My dad was still looking the other way. I wish he saw it to, but he didn''t. ",

    " I live in the Western part of New York State.  My story concerns a hunting camp I belong to that is approximately 65 miles Southwest of Buffalo, New York and approximately 20 miles Northeast of Erie, Pennsylvania.  The area is considered rural with second growth forests.  My story concerns four separate incidents over a twenty-five year span.  Taken separately you can probably explain them away.  But, taken collectively leads me to believe that there may be more to it.<BR><BR>Back in 1975 (year is approximate) my uncle, cousin, and I where at the hunting camp.  I do not recall the exact time of year but it was either late summer or early fall.  Late one evening perhaps 10:00 or 11:00 pm we heard a very strange, powerful call.  My uncle, who was a excellent outdoorsman, could not identify the call.  To me it sounded like a cross between a bird of some sort and a bobcat.  As we listened, the animal was moving through the backwoods.  After awhile my uncle decided that he wanted to locate the animal making it.  <BR><BR>The area in question is sandwiched between a large swamp (that is very, very difficult to walk through) and a 50 acre lake.  This area becomes increasing narrower and animal would most likely pass through a narrow tract of land, approximately 200 yards wide, before crossing a road.  So he, my cousin, and I headed out in to the night.  My uncle took us to a field that sits next to the narrow track.  Here we waited.  The animal was getting closer.  When it was maybe 100 yards away it stopped calling.  We could not see it, nor do I believe it could see us.  We waited for sometime but it never called again and did not cross the road.  I almost forgot about this incident until very recently.<BR><BR>Fast forward to approximately 1993.  My uncle while out hunting in the same area as mentioned above claims he had seen a Bigfoot.  As he relayed the story I could tell he was visibly agitated and quite forceful in his conviction in what he had seen.  Now, I must tell you a couple of things about my uncle.  First of all he died in 1997, so unfortunately, I cannot question him further.  But, he was a excellent outdoorsman.  He had hunted small and big game all along the eastern part of North America.  When he has younger he would go to Ontario, every spring and fall, near James Bay to hunt bear and moose.  I would say he was very familiar with bear and their habits.  So, I am sure it was not a bear he had seen.  But, he also liked to drink whiskey and beer.  So when he told us he had seen a Bigfoot, I am sure all of us (including me) thought he must have been hallucinating.  However, as I think back about my uncle, even when he was quite drunk, I had never know him to makeup stories.  He certainly liked to retell his stories over and over again.  But, they were always factual and did not varied in detail.<BR><BR>In the fall of 1999 my brother-in-law told me, while cutting firewood in the same area, he had seen something very large.  He did not get a good look at it because it frighten him so much he hopped on his four-wheeler at left the area immediately.  At the time, my brother-in-law did not know of the my uncle''s Bigfoot story.  So, I was quite intrigued.  I asked him questions as to size and color.  But, he could only say that it was very large and black in color.  I did not follow up to investigate the area because sometime had past since the incident and he had gone back into the same area without seeing anything unusual.<BR><BR>Two months ago, while reading a media story that \"Bigfoot is Dead\", I came across the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization Website (www.bfro.org).  On the website are recordings of supposed sasquatch vocalizations.  As I played one of the recordings I almost fell out of my chair!  It was the same vocalization I had heard approximately twenty-five years ago.   The sight and sounds of that night so long ago came back to me in a flash.  It was this last incident that captured my interest and convinced me to purchase your book and to study this subject further.<BR><BR>I must admit though that I do have some issues with the possibility of a sasquatch living in the area.  1) there has never been to my knowledge any other sightings in the area.  However, according to the BFRO there have been an number of incidents south of area in Pennsylvania and one incident in the next county to the east.  2) the area in question, although rural, seems a bit too populated for one or more animals to avoid detection.  Even when an occasional bear wanders through it always seems to get spotted from time to time.  3) I too have hunted and hiked over the same area many times in the past thirty years and have never seen anything to suggest a large creature is living in the area.  4) the area supports a large deer population, but, I have never come across a deer kill in the manner described on this web site.  To be fair, although I raise these issues, I also have never actively looked for signs of Sasquatch.<BR><BR>Paul J. Mateja<BR><BR><BR>",

The best hope of solving this was the hair-like material we found at the site and subsequently sent to Cornell. I never got an official report back but I did hear that it was never identified.

''If it''s a hoax, someone did a good job...''<BR><BR>By Melanie Conty<BR>The Corning Leader<BR>--------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>Rathbone - Bigfoot may be stomping around town, according to people who found huge footprints, hairs and uprooted vegetation near an area pond, area residents suspect.<BR><BR>Officials at the New York state Department of Environmental Conservation and Cornell University are examining the findings, and said they do not know who or what they''re from.<BR><BR>\"If it''s a hoax, then someone did a pretty good job of setting this thing up,\" said Michael McKeon, a DEC spokesman in Albany. \"And if it''s not a hoax, then we''ll have to see if Bigfoot''s out there.\"<BR><BR>The prints were each 15 inches long, five inches wide and embedded at least an inch in the mud, McKeon said.<BR><BR>They were spaced over 40 inches apart and casts taken showed bunions on the feet.<BR><BR>McKeon said he didn''t believe the claims at first, but now is not so sure.<BR><BR>Nellie Ferry of 6788 Hardscrabble Road spotted the prints Aug. 9, when she and her husband, Joe, were fishing at a neighbor''s pond.<BR><BR>A few days later more showed up, and then on Wednesday more appeared on the pond''s other side.<BR><BR>\"I''m not saying (Bigfoot) is what this thing is, but we''re trying to get an idea,\" Ferry said.<BR><BR>\"The DEC said it''s not human, but it''s not an animal.\"<BR><BR>Neighbors in this rural area about six miles outside Addison say they are intrigued and a bit anxious about the situation.<BR><BR>They report hearing noises - and sometimes a stench - coming from the remote pond.<BR><BR>\"My daughter rides her horse up there,\" said one woman.<BR><BR>\"That''s our back yard. That''s why we live up here because we feel safe. Now, I don''t feel so safe.\"<BR><BR>Many of the neighbors don''t want their names used.<BR>\"People will think we are crazy,\" she said.<BR><BR>Friends and area libraries have been providing Ferry with books and videotapes on Bigfoot, who has been spotted throughout the United States since the 1940s. A narrator of one videotape claimed to show actual footage of his Bigfoot sighting. The animal was about 8 feet tall, 400 pounds and extremely hairy. Others on the tape said Bigfoot has a pointed head, red eyes and looks \"like the devil.\"<BR><BR>The species is believed to exist on fresh fish and vegetation, and there has been no evidence that it eats red meat. Wolves allegedly roll around on its footprints and are quite receptive towards its stench, described as a combination of sewage and musty, wet cloth.<BR><BR>Sightings have been in Alaska, California, Vermont, and Florida, and upstate New York, the last here in the Adirondacks in 1972. Believers say about 1,200 Bigfoot exist in the United States.<BR><BR>Ferry said whatever has been walking around the pond has pulled up cat tails and eaten their roots, and lately she has heard howling and other unusual sounds from the woods at night.<BR><BR>McKeon said he does not believe there is yet cause for alarm.<BR>\"It''s not something that we think is a real problem,\" he said. \"There''s no reason for people to panic.\"<BR><BR>This advice, however, did not calm Ferry. \"I am getting nervous over it,\"she said. \"I mean, I would like to see it to find out what it is.\"<BR><BR>",

    " While hunting with a friend on his farm during deer season this past Nov, we were walking the creek bottom to get up to a stand of pines at the edge of a small swamp on his property, after walking about 200 yards we stopped for a bit to listen and observe and maybe jump a deer crossing over, we were there about 10 minutes when we started to hear something above and just behind us, the creek bottom at that point has about 8 foot banks on both sides, we continued to hear the noices get closer, but it seemed to be going parralel to us on the deer trail. having spotted bear recently, we thought it might be one and hoped it would cross about 60 yards in front of us, we moved a little further up and the noises stopped, figuring the bear heard us we stopped, it was quiet for about 20 minutes when it began again, only more hurried this time. at one point I could see movement in the woods and at first thought it might have been a bear standing up, but it kept walking on the hind legs, it turned and came across the creek about 60 yards from us and we just watched it run across the creek and up along the power line on the other side, it jumped down the bank and jumped back up on the other side. We couldn''t get a clear look because of the pines and the fact it was really moving when it came across the creek, but it was no bear, we both have been hunting for a good 25 years ech and we agreed it wasn''t a bear or any other animal we have ever seen. we listened to it for about another 3 to 5 minutes going through the pines and brush, then the noises just stopped, we went up and back tracked it as best we could but lost the sign just the other side of his farm pond.",

    " Visual Report: My name is Alan Y. on about Mid-November 2012 I had a very unusual experience that at first kept me very mixed up, but always stayed in my mind until I started doing research.<BR><BR>It was about 2 to 3am in the morning. I awoke to go outside and have a smoke. The area of the town of Bath, NY is semi-rugged with hundreds of huge foothills. There is a vast amount of forest, lakes, ponds, wildlife and many state parks. Much of the land is posted \"no hunting\". The hills are super steep, so climbing or hiking is difficult. We rented the full basement apartment of a home. Our entryway was in the back of the home semi-underground. There was a deck over our entryway. <BR><BR>I am an ex-US Army Intel (Special Tasking veteran) who served in central America and the Middle East. I am telling you this because I am a trained observer and weigh out everything I see. I am super aware of my surroundings. That morning I went outside and lit up a cigarette. It was very dark this night and cool. Deer would constantly wander through and many times I could be 10 feet from a deer and be silent so as not to spook them.<BR><BR>As I lit up my smoke some movement caught my attention about roughly [140] yards directly in front of me to the East. A cinnamon brownish colored figure was pacing back and forth over and over. On each side of this clear cut there is a couple homes. This thing was at the far end by the next tree line pacing back and forth moving towards the last home and back again moving appx. North to South then back the other way. It was moving erratically pacing back and forth like it was confused or undecided if it wanted to go closer to the home.<BR><BR>As I looked at first, I thought it was a drunk person? But in all the years I lived there, I never seen anyone out there. As I watched what really caught my attention was it looked like it was floating across the ground as there was absolutely no head bob at all. The ground rose between myself and this entity and went back down on its side so I could not see the lower legs good. It kept on pacing back and forth for about 3 minutes. At the position I was at under the deck, in the shadows, I was not observed by this creature.<BR><BR>Im not a afraid of too much, but for some reason the hairs stood up on the back of my neck and I got into what I call (combat mode). I wanted to bellow out at this entity (Ahh) but something said do not do that. Around 3 to 4 minutes of this pacing, I turned my head for a second and it was gone. I got a fearful sense of where this thing went and had a feeling it may try to flank me around the 2 homes, so I went into the house and awakened my wife and said theres something weird out there.\"<BR><BR>I did not think of \"Bigfoot\" right away, because it was not the Patty type I seen on the P&G film. I also thought that they are in the Northwest, not really here in New York State. It was I believe 6-7 feet tall, a slimmer build. Wide on top and slimmer than Patty. More like a fine-tuned athlete than a body builder, long arms and an awfully long shaggy head of hair (which stood out too me, WEIRD.<BR><BR>The reason I even saw it was because there was a light on that home as he was pacing towards, that lit up it and some of the area.  Upon seeing it (after the fact), I realized that there was a hedgerow running parallel to it, and a large ravine behind that that ran into the woods. Across from this property was a road, couple mobile homes then a very step wooded foothill (small mountain).<BR><BR>For years this baffled me, and I could not get this out of my mind until I visited the BFRO website and seen at least 6 reports entirely around my area. Thank you, for having a website where we can get these things off our chest. <BR>",

    " I was bike riding at roughly 10:30 AM on Saturday, September 30th.  While riding on Marsh Road from Route 223 toward Chemung, I suddenly smelt a very rancid, decaying type of smell.  I thought what I smelt was a large roadkill, so I scanned the road to the right and left of me looking for a deer carcass or the like.  As I turned me head from right to left I caught a glimpse of large patch of what appeared to be brown fur about 15 -20 yards ahead of me and roughly six feet off the ground. The fur seemed to be moving back into the woods as though it was approaching the road and then suddenly decided to reverse direction.  Nothing had crossed the road in front of me.  I rode past the area where I had seen the fur and looked back into the tree-line for the white tail of a deer or to hear the sound of something moving through the woods.  I saw or heard nothing.  I then realized whatever I saw was VERY far off the ground, and probably not a deer.  It was about this time I also noticed a dog, chained in a yard across the road, that was barking in the direction I was looking and seemed extrememly agiated.  Being a pretty consistent bike rider I could tell too that the dog was showing not interest in me.  Taking into account what I did, and did not see, combined with the smell, I thought I may have had a sasquatch sighting.  I decided to ride further up the road, turn around, and ride back trying to notice the smell again.  The second time past the area there was no smell at all, which surprised me because it was EXTREMELY strong when I first rode through.  I can''t really claim a sighting, but it seems either I can claim a smelling, or at least a series of brief events (all of this probably happened in less than 10 seconds) that when put together point toward me running across something in the woods that doesn''t fit a schema of anything I have seen or noticed before.",

There was a work crew working on the railroad at the edge of our property. I noticed this large animal come-up out of the river. I thought it was a bear. My son noticed it also. It was dark and walked like a man. In comparison to the men on the RR tracks it 2 to 3 times larger than the men working. It had a large head that seemed to fall into the shoulder with not much of a neck. It had longer arms and a slight sway as it walked. The men on the RR were behind a hedgerow and would not be able to see the animal. It went around the bend in the river and disappeared. The next day I got to thinking about it and went down to the river to see if I could find any tracks. I went to the spot where it came out of the river. I was unable to find any tracks. I feel it came out of the because the was a trash build up of debris, tires and all sorts of things. Rather than trying to get through that mess it walked around. It think the animal was using the Canisteo river for a road out of sight.",

    " This account happened on the night of the lunar eclipse back in 2003.  I was camping with my friend Pete in NY up behind his cabin (about 1/4 mile up the hill).  It was about 11pm and we were both in our bags in the shelter we built. <BR><BR>Pete was already asleep... I was trying to sleep but couldn''t so I was poking the fire with a long stick.  I heard something coming down the hill (heard rustling leaves, etc) but figured it was deer coming down the game trail.  It is tough to tell where sounds come from at night and judge distance in the woods because it''s so quiet.... but I figured it was pretty far out (about 150 or 200 yds) moving to our left.  I heard some sort of popping sound like the trunk of a tree being hit with something solid or two 2x4s being smacked together and a few growls (kinda like a lion but higher pitched, kinda like a stomach growling)... I still didn''t really pay any attention.  I dismissed the popping as trees cracking and the growling to Petes stomach or a low volume snore.  Whatever this thing was, it circled our camp keeping the same distance away.  All I heard was the rustle of leaves or twig snaps.  I kept hearing the popping sound occasionnally but I still wasn''t freaked out.  The sound eventually stopped basically where it I started hearing it.  I starting thinking that whatever it was, it was a predator (showing stalking behavior)... I figured it was a bear, fox, or some other predator/scavenger that thought it was a good idea to leave us alone.  But then I started getting a really creepy feeling that I was being watched.  I thought my mind was playing tricks and I was imagining it...  but it got worse and worse.  I couldn''t hear anything definitive in the woods but was still getting creeped out.  <BR><BR>I could only see part of the woods because only part of our shelter is open... but I started looking around (from my bag inside the shelter, not walking around) and what I could see was lit up pretty well because of the full moon (after the lunar eclipse anyway).  I looked into a stand of trees and saw a really big dark spot... it looked like a broken off tree trunk darkened by shadow... in basically the same spot where the noises stopped.  I looked around the woods a little more and came back to the  same spot where I saw the tree looking thing... and IT WAS GONE!!  I woke Pete up so I could tell him what was going on... and so I would know I wasn''t crazy if I heard something again.  I was telling him what was going on when we heard the popping/thudding sound again... He loaded his gun (Pete has a permit to carry a handgun in NY).  <BR><BR>We got out of our bags and restoked the fire and I heard his stomach growl... really loud!!  He said, \"Man you must be hungry.\"  I said I thought that was his stomach and we just looked at each other.  We went to investigate where I saw the disappearing shadow thing and we made a lot of noise to scare off whatever it was (breaking branches, kicking at the leaves, talking/yelling to each other).  We looked around the woods a bit... I heard something up on the ridge keeping pace with us but moving away.  It didn''t run, just moved away from us at the rate we were moving toward it.  We stayed up for a little while longer and heard nothing so we went back to bed.  Pete was out like a light and I stayed awake just listening.  <BR><BR>About 30 minutes later, THE THING CAME BACK!! I woke Pete up as I heard it come down off the hill from the same direction it started from... it was making a truck load of noise banging trees (we think it actually pushed one over too). It growled a few times,  and it''s foot steps were really heavy... based upon how Pete and I sounded moving through the woods earlier, this thing had to weigh much more than both of us (I''m 6''2\" and 250lbs).  It came in on our left and walked behind our camp about 30-50 yds... We couldn''t see it because it was on the non-open side of our shelter and we didn''t want to pop out and provoke an attack.  It kept walking in the same direction and eventually was out of earshot but we figured that was enough of a warning. We packed up and went back to the cabin.  <BR><BR>There are many screwed up things about this.  First, I''ve been hunting for years and I don''t get spooked... Pete is ex-military and no slouch in the woods either.  But this spooked us bad enough to make us want to pack up the gear at two in the morning (leaving some of it on the hill) and come back to the cabin.  Second, two of us heard this thing so I know its not just my mind playing tricks on me... it was definitely there!!  Third, this thing was massive... It made a whole bunch of noise when it walked behind our camp (more than any animal I have ever heard) and it''s footsteps almost shook the ground.  But here comes the most screwed up part of the story.  I have hunted for 15+ years and know what animals sound like coming through the woods... I have heard deer, bear, fox, etc... just about any animal in NJ, NY, PA, and ME... and, ofc ourse, other hunters.  I can tell you with 100% certainty...  THIS THING WAS WALKING ON TWO FEET!!  <BR><BR>I checked the area the next day and found a large foot print in soft earth... about 3 inches longer than mine and about 2 inches wider (I wear a size 12).  I tracked the animal (or whatever) for a few hundred yards but only found one other definate track and it was the same size roughly.  I also found a dead tree that was knocked to the ground probably the night before (fresh earth on the roots, leaves under/around it disturbed)... I presume it was the large crash we heard the night before.",

    " It was during 1997, late summer or early fall and my mother and I were visiting my Grandmother upstate. It was about 10pm and we were sitting outside on the back deck looking at the stars and listening to the night. We had made sure all the outside lights were off so we could see the stars better. My mother was sitting on one of the benches facing the house, and I was sitting on the steps facing the back yard. It was so dark, I couldn'' see more than a foot or two beyond my own feet.  We had been out there for a little while, and had not been talking, so it was pretty quiet. Suddenly, from about 20 to 30 feet down the yard, there was the strangest noise I had ever heard. It was kind of a cross between a scream, grunt and a donkey brey, not overly loud, and lasted for about 5 seconds or so. A second or two later, it started again, only closer, so I jumped up to go in and turn on the light, but accidently let the door close. When I got the light on, nothing was there. I grabbed a flashlite and scanned the yard, but saw nothing. Mom and I just looked at each other and ran into the house! The next day, I went to where the noise had come from, but saw no evidence that anything had been there.",

We were about 1/2 the way down the trail, in a clearing that had woods on one side and a swamp on the other side. All of a sudden we both hear what we thought was an animal or something running through the woods, when (what we believe was a ''bigfoot'') ran across the path we were walking on. It wasnt brown like we would have picture bigfoot being, it was more like grayish-white. It appeared to be around 6-7 feet tall.

AND AS I SAT THERE I COULDNT HELP BUT THINK ABOUT THE \"BABY BIGFOOT PICS TAKEN FROM A TRAIL CAM IN FOREST COUNTY IN 2008\" IT MADE ME FEEL A LITTLE UNEASY, BEACAUSE I BELIEVE THESE CREATURES EXIST AND I''LL TELL YOU WHY.<BR><BR>ONE MORNING IN LATE NOV.1988 I WENT DEER HUNTING NEAR MY HOME IN CLAIRTON. I DROVE DOWN RAVENSBURG BLVD. AND TURNED OFF TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD JUST BEFORE THE RAVENSBURG<BR>BRIDGE AND DIRECTLY ADJACENT TO CLAIRTON PARK.<BR><BR>I DROVE ABOUT 100 YARDS DOWN A DIRT ROAD TO THE BASE OF A VERY STEP AND HEAVILY WOODED HILLSIDE.IT WAS APPROX. 05:30, IT WAS CLEAR AND VERY COLD, NEAR PITCH BLACK. I EXITED FROM MY VEHICLE. I OPEN THE REAR DOORS TO RETRIEVE MY GUN AND OTHER HUNTING EQUIPMENT.<BR><BR>AS I TURNED AROUND I HEARD A NOISE APPROX 20 YARDS IN FRONT ME AND TO MY RIGHT. THERE WAS A HEAVY THICKET THERE. ALL OF A SUDDEN I OBSERVED I VERY LARGE VERY BROAD HUMANOID SHAPE RISE UP FROM THE THICKET. THE MASSIVE SHAPE DARTED TO THE LEFT IT MADE UP THE STEEP HEAVILY WOODED HILL SIDE IN A FEW SECONDS AND WAS OUT OF SIGHT.<BR><BR>I WAS STUNNED,SHOCKED AND REALLY NOT SURE WHAT HAD JUST HAPPENED. I WAITED FOR IT TO GET LIGHT BEFORE I ENTERED THE WOODS. I SAT IN MY DEER STAND FOR THE REST OF THE DAY WITHOUT INCIDENT.<BR><BR>I DONT USUALLY TELL THIS STORY BECAUSE PEOPLE THINK  I''M JUST MESSING AROUND WITH THEM. MY WIFE DOESNT EVEN BELIEVE ME. <BR><BR>IVE HUNTED AND EXPLORED THESE WOODS SINCE I WAS 12 AND I HUNTED IN THIS SAME SPOT A FEW TIMES  JUST LAST SEASON. IVE DONE SOME RESEARCH ON YOUR WEB SITE A SAW ANOTHER INCIDENT AROUND THE SAME TIME A FEW MILES FROM MY INCIDENT. WHEN A WAS A KID ME AND 3 FRIENDS WERE WALKING THROUGH THESE SAME WOODS WHEN SOMEONE STARED THROWING ROCK AT  US FROM A NEARBY HILLSIDE. WE JUST FIGURED IT WAS OTHER KIDS SO WE THREW ROCKS BACK AND CURSED.<BR><BR>THESE ARE NOT BIG VAST WOODS THESE ARE LARGE PATCHES OF STEEP HILLS AND HEAVY THICKETS.<BR>BUT I READ ABOUT OTHER LOCAL INCIDENTS ON YOUR WEB SITE. <BR><BR>",

    " My name is Amanda and I live in Plum, Pennsylvania.  On july 23rd, I was sitting out side talking to my boyfriend of nine months, Tommy.  I heard some moving in the woods beside our house, but disregarded it as a wolf or a bear or something like that.  I continued talking to tommy for about another 20 minutes when i smelled something strange and happened to look up and see a figure in the middle of our field that appeared to be about 8 or 9 feet tall.  It was very large and was covered in dark brown to black hair from head to foot.  It''s face was part human, part...something else.  I jumped up in fear, ran into my house and immediately locked the doors and shut the blinds.  My family was wondering what was wrong with me, they all said that i was \"as pale as a ghost\".   My mom went out and shone a flashlight around, we saw nothing else that night.  The next morning my cousin and I woke up and went outside to investigate.  We found flattened grass and 3 clearings in the woods and tracks that led deep into the woods.  We were going to go into the woods, but both of us were to frightened by what we had already found to venture off into the woods.  that was the scariest moment of my entire life.",

The interviewers seemed to be trying to connect the bigfoot sightings with UFO sightings in the area. This was all in the 70''s and 80''s.

    " A friend and I were sitting down on a pipeline right of way. We heard a noise that sounded like something that a large bird might make. A little while later, we heard something that sounded like someone knocking on a tree with a piece of wood or something. These sounds continued alternating, off and on for about 20 minutes or so. I remember that my friend and I were talking about how the sounds were a little strange, and getting louder. At one point, I realized that the sounds were coming from a point very close to us, and they seemed to be coming from the same place, so we stood up to see if we could see anything. <BR><BR>It was then that we saw the animal. It looked at us, we looked at it, and we all took off running. Before running, I noticed that what I was looking at was about 7 feet tall, relatively the same proportions as a normal human, except for longer arms, and it was covered with shaggy (2-4\" long) grey hair. The face was not clear to me. I have slight astigmatism and I could not make out the features at the distance of about 20-30 yards. <BR><BR>The animal crashed through the woods as it ran away- just breaking down everything in it''s way. I kept looking back as I ran, and it just seemed to be going in a straight path up the hill towards Sample Road. <BR><BR>Some years later I visited a wax museum in Niagara Falls and at the end of the exhibit was somebody''s idea of a bigfoot. It looked very much like the one that I saw, except for the facial features. This one had big pointy teeth and looked pretty angry. I could not clearly see the face of the one I saw, but I don''t think it had big pointy teeth and an angry expression.<BR><BR><BR>",

    "      Well, my younger brother saw it when he was around 8-9 years old, in the late ''70''s. <BR>     Our home was somewhat isolated and had  woods all around it.  We  played in the woods a lot.  He told me that once he saw \"Chewbacca\" standing in the woods watching him.  Over the years he heard weird noises coming from the woods when he was walking down the road, like screams and grunts that were almost like words.  He describes them as \"chanting\"  or sing song.  <BR>     Also, while by myself in a field beside our house, I heard a very frightening noise coming from the woods at the edge of the field; like growling and snarling  coming from somewhere behind the trees.  I saw nothing, but the best I can tell you a very large animal made those noises. Since the noises were loud I could tell the direction they were coming from easily and it was way above my head from the tops of the trees.  I never heard any animal before or since that made a noise like that. Being around 10 or 11 years old, I didn''t hang around to check it out, but later I told my brother and he related to me about the time he saw \"Chewbacca\".  Then one of us wondered out loud, \"Was it Bigfoot?\"  To this day, we don''t know.",

    " I HAVE AN AUDIO TAPE OF THIS EVENT, IT HAS NEVER BEEN HEARD BY ANYONE OTHER THAN A FEW NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS AROUND THE TIME THIS HAPPENED.   It was a fall evening, I was doing homework at our trailer, which was 1/2 mile from where my dad was building our house. He would get home from work around 4:00 and work out there till 10. One evening he came flying out the road in his truck and pulled in the driveway, then ran to the trailer asking my mom for the tape recorder. I was curious and asked him what was going on, he said that there was something in the valley fighting with a dog. So I grabbed my coat and wanted to go see, he let me go with him, but told me to stay in the truck, I didn''t listen and tried to follow him. So he told me to stand by the cows feed trough, which was near the house at top of field. He grabbed a wooden club and put the tape recorder in his shirt pocket and started walking down the hill towards the noise. I remember that when this creature growled, it shook the ground where I was standing, about 200 yards away. I was scared, and even more scared for my dad, who was now about half way to it. Another weird thing was that the 6 head of cattle we had were standing head to head in a circle at the edge of the woods. It took my dad about 5 minutes to get to the woods, where this creature was fighting a dog, you can hear the leaves crunching under every step he took. But when he got nearer it was too dark in the wooded valley for him to see the creature. So he returned back up the hill. The entire time that the recorder was on, you can hear this earth moving growl along with a dog fighting with it. Oddly, our neighbors dog (HENRY), who came around a lot, was never seen or heard from again. My dad wouldn''t let me go near that valley for a while, but eventually I was allowed to go down there.  And when I did, I looked around the area I heard the battle, and found a bunch of deer hair and bones scattered around a 20 foot area, But no (HENRY). Back when this happened I was about 8-10 years old, and didn''t think of looking for hair samples or DNA, or even footprints. Looking back, I wish I would have thought of all that stuff. But I do still have the tape recording, I really want someone from the BFRO to take this tape and get it transferred to digital. Everyone of our neighbors listened to this tape, and no one can say what it is for sure. I told my cousin about this event a few weeks after it happened, and her eyes got big and told me that one of her friends and her mom seen some big creature walking through a field below their house. The thing that made me wonder if it was the same creature is that her friend lived no more than 4-5 miles from me.

    " This occurred when I was about 15years old, but I remember it as if it were yesterday. <BR><BR>When I tell the story, even to the friends that were with me the night it happened, they laugh. \"I know what I saw and I would gladly take any sort of lie detector test made to prove it.\" <BR><BR>It happened around 9:30 p.m. in the summer of 1969. My friends and I had found a way that we could sneek into the community swimming pool after hours. We would peel back a small section of fence surrounding the patio and we would crawl through it.<BR><BR>We would swim, sometimes naked, for hours at a time. Occasionally the caretaker would come around to check the pool and when we saw him coming we would run through the fence and into a small patch of woods that ran along the Monongahela River.<BR><BR> On this particular evening, I noticed the headlights of a car coming toward the pool and sounded the alarm.<BR><BR>As I was the first one to enter the wooded area, I ran as fast as I could to gat away.<BR><BR>As I was running, sometimes looking over my shoulder to see if my friends were following, I ran into something. <BR><BR>This is where the strange event happened. <BR><BR>As I fell backwards, I looked up to see what appeared to be a man like creature staring back at me. <BR><BR>Although this figure was manlike in form, it happened to be around eight feet tall. It was covered in a long hair like element from the head to the feet. It also had an unforgettable smell. <BR><BR>As I got to my feet I turned and ran in the direction from which I had come. As I passed my friends, who were running into the woods, I screamed at the top of my lungs,\" Don''t go that way, there is somethong back there and I ran right into it.\" <BR><BR>One question that always arises is the fact that it was dark and we were in a wooded area. I can''t recall if the moon was bright that night but the lights from the park and the near by homes made this particular area fairly bright. <BR><BR>My friends say I ran into a tree. I asked them to show me the scratches, bumps and bruises that a tree would surely leave on my face and body. Although they were sceptical, none of these brave souls would venture back to where I had just been.<BR><BR>We lingered close to that pool until the caretaker, whom we called Lighthorse (just a name that we had given him) left the area, then we all returned to our homes. <BR><BR>Most of us lived within 1/2 a mile from the pool and many of us lived along the Mongahela River. One of the friends that was with me that night was my brother, Joe. He remembers the nights but he stil laughs when I mention the happening.<BR><BR>Laugh if you must but this story is absolutly true. <BR>",

    " I picked up my uncle from work. We were traveling down Rt. 66 towards Delmont. We were traveling up the hill where the rvs are sold on the right hand side near the gas facility. I was driving at 45 MPH When my uncle says \" what the hell is that?\" I asked what he saw and his reply was \" what ever it is it was walking on two feet. The sighting was quick no longer then 5-6 seconds at a distance of 70 yards on a cloudless moon lit night.My uncle said the subject was walking up the steep embankment that is covered in almost a foot of snow and bare of trees or brush behind the rv building on a horizontal path on two legs towards the woodline on top of the hill. He described the color as a uniform black. With no distinguishing clothing. The size he said was at least his size maybe bigger. my uncles is 6''4\" and 250 pounds and he even said it was the size that caught his eye. We can''t think of any reason a person would try to traverse such a steep incline or even going to the top of the hill cause there is nothing but woods once u reach the top. My uncle said it was spooky because he couldn''t think of any reason either. I laughed and jokingly said it was bigfoot and with that my uncle started rambling about even if it was. No one would believe us. So I am contacting u to see if you guys could maybe solve this for us.",

    " My mother, brother, and I had recently moved to a secluded community on the outskirts of land known as White''s Woods. We moved in September, and it wasn''t until that summer that strange noises were heard. In July of ''96, at around 2:30am, no earlier than 2, never later than 3am, strange whistling could be heard from the woods at the fringe of the neighbourhood. It sounded like \"whooooOOOPPP, whooooOOOPPP,\" with the rise at the end of the whistle. It was a very high, shrill sound. My family and I are not outdoorsman, so I assumed it was a bird. It happened always in the early morning, several hours before dawn and always from the same location. We simply assumed it was a bird.<BR>     The following year, from July to August, always at the same time and in the same location, the whistles could be heard. This time, branches could be heard snapping. I went to school at the University of Pittsburgh. On campus, there lives a peregrine falcon, and I was lucky enough to see it take two pigeons, and there was a commotion when this happened. Assuming an owl took a rabbit, I took these occurances as eery yet explainable. However, what happened the following year is what gives me pause.<BR>     My brother and I, having put up with these sounds for two years, thought we would investigate if anything happened the third year. Sure enough, at 2:30am, in July of the third year, the whistler returned. My brother and I are fit men. He was 28 at the time and I was 30. We play a lot of baseball, so we grabbed our bats and headed out. there are no streetlights in the area. And once outside, the whistling seemed to fill the air. It was very loud and quite easy to pinpoint. About 100yds from our house, something was whistling amid the brush and trees. The height of the sound was about 7ft (high off the ground yet discernable to know it wasn''t coming from the trees). My brother and I investigated, baseball bats in hand. About 25yrds from the whistling, something strange happened. The whistling continued in it rhythmic, rising cadence, but as we approached, something growled underneath the whistle. I don''t know how else to discribe it. The whistle continued with a growl at the same time. The growl sounded wet and we were so close we could actually hear it take in air. The whistle growl sent us, baseball bats in hand, running for home.<BR>     The whistler returned the following year, but only once. We did not investigate. It hasn''t returned since. After the pre-emptive investigation, it came back only rarely. And now it seems to be gone.",

    "      In 1985, I was attending Indiana State University in Terre Haute, IN.  One Saturday morning I was travelling to Chicago to visit relatives. I was driving north on U.S. 41 and I looked to my right down into a small valley (more a depression in the land than a valley) with a small stream running through it. About 100-150 yards from the highway, I saw a large dark-colored creature walking away from the road (to the east.) It was very broad and I could clearly see the creature''s arms swinging. My view of the bottom part of it was obscured by tall grass and I could only see the very tops of its legs. The head never turned at all. I saw this for 4-5 seconds before the trees on the north side of the depression obscured my view. There were also trees on the south side. My immediate thought was that I didn''t really see what I thought I did. I continued driving, unsure of what to do. After a few minutes, I turned around and drove back past where I had seen it (my view from this side of the highway was blocked), turned around again, drove to the bridge where the sighting occurred and stopped where I had originally seen it. There was nothing there at this time. Not being aware of any sasquatch sightings in this area (or the Midwest in general), and not knowing what else to do, I continued on to Chicago and didn''t think much more about it for many years.  <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>  ",

Then I can see in the moonlight movement with the foot steps crunching the leaves. It was definitely on two feet.  Then it stops. All of a sudden a loud bang off the tank. I think it had to have thrown a rock as loud as the bang on the tank was. Then more footsteps leaves crunching even closer now.

It had to have seen me at this point sitting there. As I tried to get my composure I reached down in the door for my handgun. As I looked back up I could hear it walking off in the leaves.

    " On the opening day of antlered deer season in 1982, my father, a family friend, and myself encountered a strange figure walking towards us in the pre-dawn woods.  This occured in state forest land in North-Central Pennsylvania.<BR><BR>There was about 1/2 foot of snow on the ground, but the temperature had risen all night, leading to fog and drizzle by dawn.  We had just walked about half a mile down a logging road towards our spot.  We were catching our breath before ascending a steep hill when we noticed a hulky figure approaching, walking upright through some fallen timber that covered a beaver swamp in that area. <BR><BR>This figure was dark in color (no red or orange hunting clothes), carried no visible equipment (including a flashlight--its ability to navigate through the terrain in the dark was an immediate signal to us that something out of the ordinary was going on here), and did not answer our attempts to communicate. <BR><BR>It stopped about 50 feet away from us, looked in our direction, than headed back from where it had come.  Our reaction at the time was that this was probably the dumbest hunter we had ever seen, but in later years (especially with some reports of Bigfoot sightings coming from PA) we wonder who or what it was.  There is no doubt for any of us that this was not a bear.",

We were sitting in the middle of a dead-end dirt road, surrounded by a small farmer''s field, small lake and very thick woods and hills.  We heard a horrible screaming  coming from the woods next to the field, about 50 feet away.  We all jumped up and immediately shined out flashlights in the direction of the sound but did not see anything.  The night was too dark and our beams too dim.  The girls got scared and ran into the cabin to hide.  My co-counselor and I stood outside for about a 1/2 hour listening to the screams, which came at intervals throughout the entire time.  I have never heard anything like it.  It sounded like something screaming in death.  I cannot describe it; it was a very large sound.  I am an outdoorsperson and know the sounds that most animals make, and I had never heard anything like that before and had never heard anything since, until I was browsing around on your website and discovered your recorded sounds.  I downloaded the most recent scream (not the howl) and it sounded exactly like what I heard that night.  I listened to it over and over again to be sure that it was the same sound and although I am not certain what it was that we heard that night, it certainly is the same scream.  We heard it for only about a 1/2 hour that night; there were no answering screams.  I heard a similar scream about a week later from a distance away.  This time I was alone.  ",

    " This story was recently told to me second hand in confidence by a very good friend of mine.  He is an Eagle Scout and an honorable man.  We are avid sportsmen and had spent alot of time together and with other sportsmen in the woods of Pennsylvania.  I told him of my interest in the Florida Skunk Ape.  I asked him if he or any of his family had ever heard or experienced any bigfoot encounters.  He told me that it was ironic that I asked because I was present when his experience occurred.  We were in Boyscouts at the time at a fall campout with our Troop, we were in the same Patrol.  Our Troop was playing \"Capture the Flag\" around dusk.  We were camping at a place called \"Hell''s Hollow\" near the Greenville Sportsman Club out on Route 358.  He and another Boyscout went out in the woods to hide.  While they were hiding in some brush, they pushed a Bigfoot that rambled out of the brush and away from them at an alarming rate of speed.  He said it definitely was bipedal and was huge.  My friend stated that he was scared to death and that they made a promise not to tell anyone for fear of ridicule.  He stated that he has never told anyone the story.  I couldn''t get any details as to the size or scent.  He did state that he did not see its face.  I told him of my intent to report the story and he said he would discuss it if contacted by the BFRO.<BR> ",

I jumped up just in time to see a large brown figure going into the woods toward a stream behind my house. She said it ran from the neighbors down a powerline and was snapping off sumac like they were twigs.  Being young and curious I ran about 75 yds to the spot the animal had entered, there was a small drop off of about 20 feet then a level spot about 10 ft, then another 4 ft drop to the creek bed. When I arrived I observed the bigfoot at about 50 yrds, It must have heard me as it stopped and turned its upper torso and looked at me. The animal was between 6 and 7 ft tall with a dark face, after looking at me it made great strides down the creekbed and was gone around the bend. When my father arrived we went to check the area. There were very large heel prints in the top of the bank where the animal had landed when it leaped off of the top. I hunted those woods for years and there were times that I felt I was being watched, We heard vocalizations one night but my father said it was a bobcat, after hearing bigfoot recordings I believe they are what made the noise.

    " I was returning home from a NFL football game that I had attended out of state.  It was about 8:45pm. The road I was traveling on had a lot bends with patches of woods on both sides, broken up by houses every so often.  It is a back road that connects two towns.  The posted speed limit ranges from 10mph to 45mph.  I was traveling at about 55-60mph on the straighter sections(I was trying to get home, I had been driving for a couple of hours).  This is where it happened.  One of my good friends was sitting in the front with me.  We had the radio up loud and was singing and staring straight ahead. Two more of my friends where in the back seat talking.  As I came around a bend into a straight-a-way, with woods on both sides, something caught my vision just in the edge of the headlights(high beams).  I saw the mid and lower torso, and legs of what appeared to be a person.  It appeared to be crossing the road. I saw it take a right and then left stride and then it went into the trees on the right side of the road.  I vaguely saw the color, it was a light brown.  When I first saw the movement I thought it was a person going into the woods, this is the movement it had, however it glided with great speed.  It happened so quickly, I thought that I had imagined it until I looked at my friend sitting next to me, he was staring back at me, this made the hair on the back of my neck stand on end.  I asked him if he \"seen that\" and he yelled \"yeah\".  I had slowed down to about 40mph with the intent to stop(not really knowing what to do) when the two in the back seat yelled \"whats going on?\"  I said, me and (name of friend) saw something, and the two in the back told me to keep going, they did not want to stop.

    "Since this, I''ve been doing research nearby. Many encounters happened in this area and west through Venango County. Since this, I have met a person who believes he has been having encounters while camping in this forest. I have seen pictures of tracks made approximately 10 miles from this location. When you talk to the local folks, they will tell you about these creatures. However, nobody is doing any real research there, so it stays fairly quiet. I did contact the rangers station headquarters in Warren Pa but have never heard back from them.",

    "Nothing heard. I didn''t smell anything odd either like I''ve heard happens often. There was rock throwing, which is what got my attention. No growling or noise from the creature at all. It was almost a peaceful, curious look to it. I actually did not fear for my life until it moved backwards into the thick forest. That''s when I took off.",

    " I have debated whether or not to report my encounter to the BFRO or any organization. I don''t know why, but I guess I wanted to keep this experience to myself for a few years and then it just didn''t seem to matter as far as reporting it. But now, I realize that all encounters need to be in a data base somewhere. These DO exist and when that day of discovery happens, this database will house many of the answers.<BR> <BR>My encounter happened in early June of 2010. I took a friend to the Marienville/Timberline ATV trails northeast of Marienville, Pennsylvania in the Allegheny National Forest, to ride ATVs for the day. Allegheny National Forest covers approximately 515,000 acres or 800 square miles of protected wilderness in North West Pa. The forest is pretty dense in most spots and has many types of terrain. From my understanding the Allegheny National Forest is one of the least densely populated areas east of the Mississippi River. Surrounding the Forest are more woodlands and farm country. <BR><BR>The 2 trail systems we were riding that weekend join together and make an approximate 60-80 mile loop from the northern end down to the bottom, and then back up the other side of the loop. My encounter happened on our return back up, heading North. I remember it rained very hard the night before and through the early morning because my friend, who was new to ATV''ing, didn''t bring rain gear. We had to go into town to buy him some cheap rain gear and then headed up to the trail.<BR><BR>It rained the first half hour or so of our ride and I remember the sun coming out and it was turning into a really nice day for a ride. For those that ride ATVs, they know that the rain makes mud, which is much more fun to ride in than dust. A few hours into the ride, having stopped and observed some beaver dams, some very old oil wells, a couple logged out areas where you could see for what seemed like miles and other cool sites that the forest has to offer, I was getting in more of a hurry to get back - it was approaching the end of the day. My buddy was way behind me so I decided to stop on the trail and wait for him. I usually don''t separate from atv buddies when riding, but this part of the trail was an abandoned logging trail and pretty easy so I rode ahead awhile and then decided to stop and wait for him. He didnt ride fast or dangerous; he \"putted\" so I knew he was safe, just slow. If he didn''t shown up I would turn around and meet up with him.<BR><BR>I wasnt sitting long. I just took my helmet off. Thats when I noticed rocks kept hitting the front right side of my ATV. They werent large rocks, maybe about or just smaller than hand sized. It took a minute or so before it occurred to me that I was stopped and that rocks should not be flying through the air and hitting my atv. I was turning my head towards the right to follow the path of these \"air rocks\" as I called them, when my turn stopped. I noticed this Stump which turned out to be a dark figure, approximately 70-90 feet away, that appeared to be in a sitting or crouching, or just a low position, then stand up into an upright position. Ill never forget how it seemed to pop right up like it was on a spring, with very little effort.<BR><BR>Initially I looked at its hands because I was interested to see what was in its hand, if anything. It was much taller than a normal human  best guess at this point would be 7.5 feet or so, and absolutely NOT a bear.<BR><BR>It was VERY broad at the shoulders. Almost freakishly broad  I remember that very well. It was on 2 legs and I could see its right arm hanging down, which was on the left side because it was facing me. I remember wanting to watch its right hand to see if it was armed or what it might be doing. That is funny to me now, because for some reason I assumed it was right handed. It moved its right arm to a slightly bent position, stopping with its hand in front of it, at about its waist. Its left arm stayed hanging to its side  very long arms.  It was all very dark black  a shiny black  from head to toe, or as far as I could see to its feet as it was standing in 1-2 foot tall grass or taller. As my eyes made their way up on the creature I could see its head was all black as well. There was no white or lighter color that stood out, like most animals would have on their face. I could not see clear details of the face as it was all black as well but it did not appear to have hair on all of its face. It appeared to be black skin - the same color black as its hair but I could tell it wasn''t hair in some spots. I noticed that the eyes were black, or very dark and deep, with a pronounced brow ridge. I could obviously tell it had a face. I just couldnt see defined detail of the lips or anything as it was all the same color. The lips were closed though and in a straight line across its face, not open mouthed or smile or frown  just straight lips.<BR><BR>The hair was short to medium length and not shaggy. Id say the hair was an average of 3 to 5 inches long, shorter at the head.  It was almost groomed in appearance but I think its from the hair being short and thick. At least that was my impression. Oddly, I did not notice any mud or dirt all over it, which seemed odd because it had rained hard the night before and didn''t stop until several hours before this. The trails were muddy. Almost as soon as my eyes were at its head and face and I was trying to zoom in and get a better look at the face, it began to leave. It didnt turn and walk away, but rather it stepped straight backwards into the brush and the trees and not take its eyes away from me. It stayed square to me as it was moving backwards. This all happened in the span of no more than 30 seconds, from the time I noticed the rocks hitting my ATV, up until it moved backwards. When I play it over and over in my mind, it seems more like 30 minutes. At this point an overwhelming fear just filled my mind, and I remember feeling like I shouldnt be in this spot right now. I dont remember shaking in fear or anything like that, but I felt warm and almost like I was going to puke. So I hit the gas and took off.  I wish now that I wouldnt have just fled, but the feeling that came over me was not like Id experienced before. I had my smart phone/camera in my fender bag and it NEVER occurred to me to get it out and start video. I honestly couldnt move for a short period of time.<BR> <BR>I have been surprised by people walking up on me in the woods and have hunted all my life, so animal encounters, even bear from a distance - do not scare or alarm me. I was in the military for 6 years, and actually had the honor to serve as SEAL TEAM 4 and SDV TEAM 2 (the old UDT TEAM 2) support, as part of a special warfare boat crew. During that time, I had many highly anxious experiences as one could imagine. To summarize, I am pretty observant, I dont have a tendency to over-react and I dont scare easy. I am very level headed and definitely not crazy. I didn''t instantly think \"Bigfoot\" as I wasnt a REAL believer then. At least I doubted their existence in the Eastern US and if they existed it was only in the Northwest US, Canada or Alaska.  This encounter took my emotions to places they had not been or at least had not been for a long time. It has been going through my head for over 4 years. I didn''t tell anybody except my fiance within the first year after the encounter.<BR><BR>Now - quite a few people know. The person I was riding with that day just found out in 2014. I never told him about the story before, but because I couldnt remember if it was springtime/early summer or late summer/Fall when this happened. I asked him what week if he remembered. When he told me it was springtime / early summer, he naturally asked why  whats up? I told him what happened. It turns out that he believes in these creatures too. He then realized why I was acting so weird when we finally caught back up with each other, and then on the 2 and a half hour truck ride home. Now I wish I would have told him then. Maybe we could have joined together and gone back to look for signs or whatever we could find. Instead, the overwhelming feeling of What the heck was that, and I cant tell anybody-they wont believe me anyways took over, and I kept it to myself.<BR> <BR>Nobody has to tell me what I saw or didn''t see. I knew what I saw. I saw a large dark figure with hair that could throw rocks (and very accurately), stand up within 100 feet from me, in a large dense forest where there aren''t any cabins or people just hanging out.  I still do leave the option open for an extremely large man (larger than anyone I have ever met) in a heavily padded Gillie suit with hair on it standing about 100 foot from the trail just waiting for someone to stop in that exact spot so he could throw rocks at him and take a chance of getting shot (most folks on ATVs will pack a handgun when riding in deep woods. At least that''s my experience). Now thats being sarcastic, but trying to make a truth out of what happened. Of course that option is slim, but it will always be there as I didn''t walk up to this thing and shake its hand or hug it, so being 100% sure it was a Sasquatch just isn''t possible. I am at 99.999% sure though. I do know that a fear like Ive not felt in a long time, if ever, took over me for awhile. Something told me to go, to move on, that I shouldn''t be here right now. Again - I am a very rational person and this just didn''t make sense to me at all.<BR><BR>I eventually plan on returning to that general area, on ATV and parking the bike and doing some walking. I just need to look around and feel comfortable with that. Ever since my encounter, I cannot put this down. Ive been researching since and came across various online groups that discuss encounters. I want to learn as much as I can before returning and looking around and I want to go armed with more knowledge than I have now.<BR><BR>UPDATE: I have returned to this trail (5 1/2 years later) and found the area this happened. It was strange being there.  Some of my biggest questions since learning more about these creatures are What was it doing there, close to used ATV trails and Why did it draw my attention to itself? If it hadnt thrown rocks I would not have looked and if it hadnt stood up, I probably wouldnt have even noticed it. Someone told me that maybe it was travelling and recently crossed that trail. The reason for rock throwing and drawing attention to IT was possibly to draw attention to it on purpose so my attention wouldnt go to something else nearby less able to protect itself. I interpret that as young ones. That NEVER crossed my mind. Just to realize that one was in the area blew my mind away and made me start thinking differently about what could be out there. Now, there may have been more? Ill never know that for sure, but it does make sense to that question thats been bugging me. I now wonder if there were young close to me, maybe they were throwing the rocks being mischievous. It is still hard for me to grasp that anything could throw rocks from approximately 90 feet away and hit the same general area  very, very accurate. If it wanted to harm me, it would have beaned me in the head and I wouldnt be writing this encounter.<BR> <BR> I''ve since been researching an area about 25 miles west of this location. I went from not caring or thinking about Sasquatch to a full blown enthusiast. I attend conferences and have actually received an invitation to Beachfoot in Oregon in 2016.  For this years Ohio Bigfoot conference, Sybilla Irwin (a BFRO member and artist) is doing a drawing of what I''ve described to her, and will be unveiling it at the conference. All of this is exciting, and I cannot wait to see her bring this back to life, and return my emotions back to that 1 minute of my life that changed how I think now. I cannot attach that picture yet as the Ohio Bigfoot conference director has asked not to put it out there until after the conference. But if you would like, I could come back to this and attach the drawing, which will be as close to what I saw as possible. also - for more info on this, The guys from Monster X internet radio contacted me and asked if I would come on their show. They saw my encounter on a group. I agreed and did a 2 hour show with them, discussing this event. Google MONSTER X Dave Groves. I am not looking for any type of notoriety out of this. It''s why I haven''t put up a report. But they found me and asked, so I agreed. I feel that folks need to know about this and that these creatures DO exist Anybody who knows me will tell you I am a very honest person. It is one of my strong qualities.  I know there are many made up hoax bigfoot stories out there, but I can assure you that this is NOT one of them. I wasn''t out looking for a bigfoot that day. I did not ask for this encounter to happen. But it did, and it changed many things about me. I stopped hunting deer and have not hunted since that day. I now cannot put Bigfoot stuff down and even started a bigfoot book collection with some very old and hard to find, autographed bigfoot books. This doesn''t happen to a person overnight, unless something occurred to change them. That day certainly did change me.  ",

    " My 7year old daughter and I decided to take my girlfriend out camping on the 4th of july weekend of 2007.My girlfriend had never been camping before and I wanted to give her the full effect.<BR>   I live in Warren Pa and that is in the Allegheny Forest. <BR>   We decided to camp out near the resivior by the Kinzua Dam. That first night, we were alone. Onebody near our site for atleast a quarter mile or more. Kat(my daughter) fell asleep and the two of us sat up and chatted. Off behind the tent, about 100 yards maybe closer, I heard a thud like a stick smacking a tree. Our yorkshire terrir heard it too. Then it was louder, more distinct like a base ball bat hitting a tree. My girlfriend was nervous, I could tell. I told her I had heard such a noise on a tape of Big Foot. She didn''t like that I said that and got alittle scared. I told her it would be ok and that whatever or whoever would not come near the firelight. She still was uneasy. We heard it for about 15 miinutes as it got further away from us.I thought I heard a weird howling too but I just chalked it up as a coyote or wolf. Though I have heard big foot howls and this did sound similar. I still wasn''t sure. All in all I figured it was telling us that this was his place and that we should not be here. <BR>  I had to lie to my girlfriend so she could sleep and said it was most likely a skunk or racoon. Though I know niether of those could hit a tree like that.<BR>   The next morning, I decided to look around and went out into the forest about 75 yards or more from the camp. I could still see the tent through the trees.<BR>  I found afew old logs broken over.A few trees in the distance looked bent over as if someone had done it by hand(typical sign of big foot markings) but I never told my girlfriend. We stayed another night there but we had very noisy campers about 80 yards up the road trying to fight with another camper about the noise they were making. <BR>This was last year. Now, I went on google earth and was looking at The Kinzua Dam In Warren Pa. I noticed an orange dot near the dam just passed it to the east I believe. I clicked on it and it said 1999-10-?? I tried the link and WHOAH!! was I excited... A big foot sighting right there!!! I loved it. <BR>   I am thinking on going back to the same place to camp this summer. Just myself, my girlfriend, my daughter and our dog. I love it out there. even if it does creep my girlfriend out lol.. There is something about big foot that makes me want to hear or see more. maybe even capute it on film or video.",

    "        In 1991 my mom had a polebarn built on some property she owned in the country. This particular weekend my brothers and sisters and their families got together for a picnic. It was around noon when we arrived and started setting up the tables and preparing the food. My one brother had purchased a moped that was in exellent condition which he kept there for anyone to ride. After about an hour I thought I would take my son for a ride. He was 3 at that time. <BR>We were the first ones to ride that day.<BR>       I thought that it would be a good idea to ride back in the woods since I like them so much.<BR>There are parts where there is mostly good size trees, and there are areas where there is alot of<BR>tall saplings. though those are up toward the front of the woods. We were back there about 15 minutes When I heard the most GOD AWFULL scream I''ve ever heard in my life. The kind that will make the hair on the back of your neck stand on end. The first time I heard it, it was quite some distance away but still very loud. Being that the moped was like new it was very quite, and at times you wouldn''t think it was runnig. The second time I heard the scream it was alot closer.<BR>I''d say maybe 1/4 mile. But only 10 seconds or so had passed. You have to wonder what can travel that fast in the woods and swamp. <BR>     About another 10 seconds passed and it screamed again. This time it sounded like it was right near us. I really wanted to see what it was <BR>but then I thought could I protect my son.<BR> Whatever was coming was smashing everything. It sounded like it was knocking everything down that was in it''s way. As soon as I heard that I turned the moped around and was trying to go as fast as I could. Many times I would have to help push the bike with my feet to keep it going. I told my son if anything happened to run as fast as he could the direction we were going, and to not stop till he got back to the polebarn. We finally got out of the woods and into the field. I was hollering at the top of my voice to get someones attention. <BR>But everyone was in front of the polebarn so no body heard me. All I could think of then was here <BR>I''m about to die and nobody will see anything.<BR> We got to the front of the polebarn and the reason nobody heard me was cause they had the radio playing loud. I told everyone what happened, and everyone had a good laugh. But no one would go back to see if anything was still there. I really wanted to see what it was, but I was not willing to go back by myself.<BR>",

    " It was the spring of 1994 I believe, probably April.  I was 15 years old.  The incident happened at my friends house in Girard, PA.  There was me and four of my friends.  It was the weekend and we were ready to camp out about a half a mile away from my friends house.  He lived at the end of a dead end road that ran right by Interstate 90.  Girard is about 15 - 20 minutes from the Ohio Border. <BR> We got all of our stuff back to camp and set up around 5 or 6pm.  Our camp site was at the bottom of a ravine with a small creek running through the middle of it.  It was right next to the highway but down a little bit.  The area was dense forest of deciduous mixed with pine.<BR>  Around 12pm or so we split up into teams and started having a b-b gun war across the ravine from each other.  This was going on for probably about a half hour or so.  I was on the side of the ravine furthest from the highway with two of my friends, my other two friends were on the other side shooting at us.  Then I started to hear something moving through the woods behind us.  It was pretty loud movement with dead fallen branches snapping and twigs breaking.  I grew up out in the woods,and at the time was an avid hunter.  I have seen lots of deer and other native animals in the area and never heard such a ruckus.  Not even from humans before.  So the three of us sat there and listened for a while to this thing getting closer.  We were all a little nervous about what the hell this thing could be.  So when it continued we called a truce over to the other side and joined our other two friends on the bank next to the highway.  They said that they had been hearing the same noises and movement close to them.  <BR>So with the five of us all huddled together with b-b guns aimed we waited for a little bit.  The noises started up again really close this time so we decided to shine our lights in the same direction on the count of three.  As soon as we turned on the lights the only thing I really saw or paid attention to were these very large green glowing eyes.  They were much bigger than a humans or a bear for that matter.  I took a couple of shots at this thing in reaction( I don''t know what a b-b gun would have down but it was pure instinct).  When I got ahold of my self I realized that all of my friends were already over the fence and running down the middle of the highway.  I busted tail and caught up with them when we all stopped on the side of the higway in a ditch to rest for a second.  We were all questioning what each other saw and talking about what the hell this thing was when all of the sudden one of my friends looked up to the top of the hill that the highway fence was on and yelled wolf.  I looked up and saw this enormous outline of a body standing upright, and the biggest thing that stuck out in my mind was the size of the arms compared to the whole body.

    " My experience with Bigfoot occured when I was about ten years old during the fall of 1977.  I was always exploring the wooded area between route 5 and route 20 in northwestern PA, west of Crayton road.  One cool, wet evening just before dusk, I walked north into the woods via the main trail from our house.  At the fork in the trail, running north and east, was a small sand pit which I crouched into because I saw someone or something in the distance.  I peered over the rough, looking slightly northeastward. I watched this thing for nearly five minutes.  It was over 7 feet tall and weighted about 500 - 700 pounds from as far as I could tell.  It was black from head to toe.  Even its face was black.  It was tearing off tree limbs and pushing over rotted trees.   Playing as such as I had done several days earlier at the exact same spot. It must have been watching me.  It amazed me because there were really no rotted trees left to push over or rotted tree branches to break. It''s strength was incredible.  I could hear the sounds of trees crackling and smashing to the ground.  I grew extremely scared by bigfoots size and strength and what it might do to me if it saw me.  The hair on my body stood straight up and without looking back I turned and ran as fast as I could.  I ran approximately 50 yards back along the trail and another 100 yards through the field to my parents house.  I never returned to explore the woods for another six months.  ",

The other I didn''t see until I saw where the first one was moving away from me and headed for the tree line.   I was no more than 25 yards away.  The first one I saw very clearly.  It was approximately 8 feet tall and walking upright.  It had a sloping forehead.  The hands were at about the same level as its knees.  My best estimate would be 600 lbs.  The color was all black.  It had no hair on its face or hands.  The only sound it made was when it walked I could hear the grass being trampled.  It never looked my way or made any vocalization.  Its arms swung slightly while walking with the knuckles facing forward and not to the side like a human. My best estimate on the forearm length would be 16 inches.  When it turned left and into the tree line,  I could see its back clearly.  That''s when I saw the other one.  I saw its back only.  Shoulders on both were broad and straight.  Approximately 3 ft across.  I smelled or heard nothing, during, or after the sighting.  After they disappeared, I threw the salt block over the 12 feet embankment and left.  I have not been back since. The only thing I took away from this encounter is all they wanted to do was get away from me.",

There was absolutely no wind at all. To the right of this leaf was a very large black mass moving back and forth methodically.

    " My encounter happened at the end of summer in 1973, or 1974.  It was late August/early September, as it was the time the blackberries were ripening.<BR>I was 15 or 16 years old, and had a dirt bike that I rode on the many lease roads in the hills surrounding Bradford.  The bike had an expansion chamber, which is an extremely loud exhaust system.  I generally rode it every day on the hill behind our house in Bradford, so I knew all the roads and trails.  My grandfather had built a lot of the roads with a bulldozer, years back, working for the Kendall Oil Company.  We had also hiked this area extensively when my friends and I were kids, sometimes camping for the night.  On one occasion when we were about 9 or 10, we were chased home by a frightening screeching in the late morning from the top of this hill. (Just two of us)  We didnt know what the noise was, only that we had to run from it.  I only mention this as it was very close to the same area as where I had my encounter, and in my mind, the same animal.<BR>The day of the encounter, I had ridden up to the road at the ridgeline of the hill, and about a mile and a half towards the hospital area.  I didnt turn that way and instead went straight, towards the pipeline, which is a cleared area that runs straight up and down the mountain.  I stopped there for a second, and turned back around about 1/4 mile to a group of blackberry bushes.  I shut off the bike and started picking the berries, until the bees got to me, and I took my handful of berries and walked away.<BR>I walked back to the pipeline, stopping right before the clearing, hoping to catch some sort of animal crossing the clearing.  I had been a hunter since I was very young, which is the custom in the area, and was very good at walking quietly in the woods.  As I looked down the hill from the top of the clearing, I could see what looked like a bear, digging into the log that had been placed across the pipeline to keep people from using the cleared area as a road.  I reasoned that he heard the noise of my bike going away, so he figured I was out of the area.  The stink of the 2-cycle engine also probably masked the smell of me, as well.<BR>I was young enough to think I should get a closer look, so I got myself to a point about 50 yards away and uphill from the animal, and about 25 yards from the ridgeline road.  I stood there and ate the berries and watched what I thought was the butt of the bear visible above the log.  Remember; the log was about 50 yards down a steep hill, and the log was about 3 feet tall, and crossing the pipeline.  The bear would have to be very large for me to see as much as I did, which was a good foot or more above the log, and he was on the other side of it.<BR>He seemed to be digging for bugs or something in the log.  After a few minutes of me standing still watching him, he suddenly realized I was there.  He stopped, tried to remain still for a minute, and all the time I still thought I was watching a bear.<BR>Then he stood up.  This was no bear.  It was the most surreal moment in my life, either then or now, and Im 52 years old.  He was tall, at least 7 feet, as his knees were just barely covered by the log.  He had hair like that of a black bears fur that time of year, basically the same color and length, which obscured a lot of the features of his face.<BR>We both stood there frozen for a minute, staring at each other.  My thought was to get out of there, but the only movement I could muster was to drop the few berries I had left.  I started dropping berries, and he just turned and walked to the far side of the pipeline and into the woods, down a trail just to his side of the log.<BR>I say walked, because it was so smooth and graceful across that terrain, that I was completely overwhelmed.  As I said, I thought I was pretty good at getting around in this terrain, and I am.  The movement he used was so economical and efficient that I still see it in my mind and marvel.  There was very little or no bobbing up and down; his arms swung, but not wildly, like you would expect with an ape. The arm swing wasnt like a tight-rope walker either, as I may have needed to do, to walk across the area he walked.  It was just smooth, amazing.<BR>I stood for a few seconds after he disappeared, then decided to get myself out of there.  I ran back to my bike and headed the other way as fast as I could.  Then I started thinking I should go see where he went.  I turned around and headed back and down that pipeline to the tree.  I got the bike to the trail he used, which is a trail that immediately takes you from light to deep shade, and stays perpetually muddy.  I have tried that trail a few other times (with the same friend who was chased with me, years earlier) and have only been able to go a few yards before I had to get off the bike and push.  I started to get bogged down, so I got back out as quick as I could.<BR>I dont know what I was thinking, I guess I thought the noise would keep him away, but when I hit the mud I remembered that I couldnt take that trail.  It was always creepy dark back there, too.  I wouldnt have gone back there if it werent to prove to myself that I didnt have to run away.<BR>I never looked for tracks.  This is something else thats very strange.  I was a hunter, I looked for tracks everywhere.  The muddy trail was probably covered with them.  This has always bothered me.  I can only think that my mind was so sure that no one would ever believe me, that proof was the farthest thing from my mind.  The whole experience was so alien that I never told anyone for about 25 years.  Back then, all the Bigfoot sightings were in Washington/Oregon/California.  No one would have believed me.<BR>Maybe I also didnt want anyone to find him.  I felt extremely special to have had this experience, and I didnt want to betray that or the Bigfoot.  Anyone from Bradford will now be able to figure out where this happened from my story, and that bothers me.  I dont think they should be chased.  They seem to be a very human animal, and maybe too vulnerable to our world and weapons.<BR>Im posting this after having read the other Bradford sighting, and seeing the Elk County photos.  I did quite a bit of hunting in Elk County, and its very easy for me to believe that those photos show a real, Bigfoot animal.  As to the 1963 Bradford sighting, the Barbour Street location is very close to my sighting, and I will leave it at that.<BR>",

    " These incidents have occurred over a period of approximately 7 years. The occurrences have not been limited to a particular time of year.  <BR>I have never, nor has any in our group, sighted a creature. Most have experienced hearing knocks, LOUD branch breaks, hearing bi-pedal footsteps emanating from a creature much larger than a human would make, smelled noxious odors, and had that inexplicable feeling of being watched.<BR>The place is a cabin which has been in my son-in-laws family for 4 generations. It is located on the edge of the Allegheny National Forest, off the summit of a mountain. Across the lane from the cabin is a large meadow, belonging to a local doctor. This is sometimes planted in grain crops, other times allowed to remain fallow. There are other cabins scattered along the lane; none within eye-sight of the other. <BR>My first trip was in October of 2006. There was no other activity at the other camps. My son-in-law (Eric) and I arrived about 8-8:30 at night in the darkness. Upon exiting the Jeep, I had an immediate feeling of being watched. I have spent a good deal of time in the woods, hunting, fishing, and hiking. I am not easily spooked.  After dinner, cleaning up, and sitting up a bit talking we turned in about midnight. <BR>Around 2 A.M. I was awakened by the sound of the old wooden table and chairs being pushed about on the deck. We determined it must be a bear, and went back to sleep. Approximately 2 hours later we heard something rustling about the fire pit. We did NOT cook any food outdoors, we brought in all our empty bottles and such when we came in to discourage bears and other critters. <BR>In the morning, we found the table and chairs had been moved about, which a bear or even a large raccoon could have done. However, the fire pit had been scattered about, some of the smoldering logs rolled aside.  <BR>Another time, we were hunting in the forest behind the cabin. The topography is typical Appalachian mountain; rugged, steep slopes, ravines, small streams and bogs. Here and there are small oil seeps as well. We had just descended into a fairly open area which promised grouse. This was early November, crisp but not cold. We were each carrying shotguns loaded with upland game shells. We were walking approximately 50 yards apart when we stopped, looked at one another and asked What is that smell?<BR>From out of no-where came the most putrid, overpowering smell. It was not the oil-seeps, which have their own sulfur like smell. This was horrid! It was like a skunk on steroids, with a good measure of open septic tank, and some rotten garbage added for good measure.  We continued on our way, the smell dissipated after about 100 feet.  We tried to tell one another it was a dead deer or something; but we both knew better. I worked in a funeral home while in college; and have never experienced anything that nauseating.   We also had an unnerving feeling of being watched the entire time we were there.<BR>Upon relating the above to my daughter, Erics wife, she stated she has smelled awful odors for no apparent reason as well and felt like she was being watched several times.<BR>We have heard howls, far in the distance, and others within a quarter mile  or so of the cabin. There are coyotes in the area, yet these are much longer in duration, and have more range. Some start low, and rise toward nearly a falsetto pitch. Others have been more monotone yet will waver somewhat. Others will start low, and culminate in a scream. This is not a bob-cat, not a coyote, and all members of our party are accounted for.<BR>In March of 2014, a group of us went for Spring Opening. There were 5 of us there. As darkness set in, I decided to venture out to the open meadow to observe the Winter constellations. This is about 100 yards from the cabin. <BR>The cabin is situated on the downward slope from the summit, which is the meadow. The area behind and on both sides of the cabin is a fairly steep slope. It is heavily grown with second growth trees, brush, and scrub. There are also a lot of blow-down branches which makes walking even in daylight difficult. At night, it is an invitation for a sprained ankle at best.<BR>As I was observing the stars and enjoying the silence, I heard footsteps. Not in the trail, not in the meadow, but coming UP the slope to the south of the cabin. My initial thought was a bear. As I listened, it was apparent the foot falls were from a biped. I called out if it was any of our group and received no reply. Then the steps would start again. I called again, louder, and the steps stopped for a moment.  Then, they began again, finally stopping by the edge of the lane.<BR>There were no lights showing, the moon was in the final phase of its final quarter, and just a sliver.<BR>I started to return to the cabin. I was about 20 yards from where I heard the steps stop along the edge of the lane. As I drew parallel to that area, I heard shuffling of the underbrush, as if whatever it was had turned its entire body sideways to watch me pass.<BR>When I entered the cabin, everyone was where I had left them. There were no new leafs, mud or debris in the doorway. <BR>When I asked if they heard anything, they all said no, as they were watching Planes, Trains and Automobiles on VHS. <BR>Finally, this past Spring, a group of us went up for a weekend. While sitting about the rear deck, enjoying a fire and talking, a member of our party was encouraged to do their howl. They did. Then about 30 seconds later, the sound of a very large tree limb snapping came from down the slope behind the cabin.<BR>Could it have been a bear stepping on a branch? Perhaps, but that would be very coincidental to step on a limb just after a howl.<BR>I KNOW there is something in those mountains. I cant prove it physically; it one of those things that you know that you know.<BR>Please keep this location undisclosed. We would hate to see a bunch of people go hunting for these creatures. They dont deserve to be pursued and bothered. <BR><BR>I have been needing to share this with someone who won''t think I am off my rocker. Thank you.<BR>",

    " I was driving west on I-80 at 65 MPH, in the right lane with cruise control set at 65. We were returning from a wedding in NY. We had been in a an area of mountainous/hilly forest close to road. The country started to open up with some farmland. My wife dozed and I was rather lost in thought. I diverted my sight to about 30 degrees to the right and was startled to see something that got my attention and kept my attention until about 60 degrees to the right. It passed quickly out of view because of the speed of the vehicle and a bank and some foliage obscuring the view. <BR><BR>The road is two lane, one way and I could not return to the area without backing a long distance. There was no other traffic in sight at the time.<BR><BR>What I saw was a figure, only from about what I would assume was midway from between the elbows and wrist upward. The figure was what I think of as being the wrong color, it was the color of a kraft paper bag except slightly more reddish. ( seemed the wrong color from reports I have read). It was long hair covered and I could not see a face. It was not moving during the approx. 3 seconds that I was able to view it. It was in front of some woods, not dense, standing about 150 feet away on the other side of a strip of narrow, fallow, farm field. It seemed to be facing the highway although I could not see a face. I assumed the field had high growth in it as I only saw the upper portion.It was only the upper body and head with the hair obscuring any sign of a neck.I could not estimate size but it was stocky.<BR><BR>Among my reactions, I was imaging something or someone had put up a mannikin. I rethought that, as there did not seem to be habitation nearby and a mannikin would likely have been a full figure to get maximum startle value.<BR><BR>I know I saw something that I can accurately describe and draw a rather accurate picture. ( I am a retired industrial designer ) From the briefness of the sighting I can only say what I saw  and think that this sighting would only be of value if there were other sightings in the area. <BR><BR>When I saw the figure a strong chill went down my spine that lasted several moments. This sort of thing is not in my normal experience. I have been an instrument and glider pilot for 48 years and am rather used to making quick, fairly accurate observations in relation to that. I also have been trying to convince myself that I did not see anything. It was unsettling.<BR><BR>",

    "My son and I were prospecting on the top of a ridge on the south side of Lake Kachess three years ago when we came across Big Foot tracks in the snow.We had driven to the end of the Box canyon rd. Which is off the Lake Kachess rd.(gated now). I wanted to explore the big slide area along an earthquake fault along that same ridge. The old road in that area is closed because of the slide so we walked across the slide area and beyond.I had heard from a local resident that some bluish agates could be found just beyond the slide. We found them in some darkish colored rock then walked beyond to an old clear cut. There was still snow drifts in the timber at that time and we walked up along the timber. It was this area that I got spooked. I got a feeling something was watching us and looked around for tracks. Sure enough, about 50 ft. into the timber their were these big tracks. It spooked my son and he said what are those? I said, well it looks like you are seeing your first big Foot tracks.I could tell that they were four to five days old because the snow was melting and the tracks didn''t have sharp edges on them.You could see the toe marks though. I had a hard time believing this my self. So we followed them from the timber, across the old clearcut and into the timber on the other side. At first I thought it was some clown with snow shoes in the shape of feet but after following that far I could tell from the depth of the tracks that this thing was heavy. I weigh almost 300 lbs. and i could not imprint the snow that far. The snow was pretty hard packed.My son was getting real uneasy so we turned around and went home. I''ve been a hunter most of my life and this is the first time I''ve ever run onto tracks like these. They were at least 18 inches long. If you send me maps of the areas, I can mark the locations and send them back.",

    "It made no noise except a grunt like a big ape and a kinda squeel when it took off. The animal, and I am sure these things are animal and not human, was about eight feet tall or a little more. It probably weighed around 400 pounds. It had a grayish colored hair that was probably 12 inches in length all over its body. It had a blackish colored face with lots of hair and almost no neck at all. Its arms extended below it''s knees and were very muscular.When it took off, it used it''s arms to propell it to speed and grabbed at the vine maples in front of it then swung them behind it as it took off. I think this was as a protective manuever to cover its back as it left. It had a small butt and ran like an ape. As for sex/ I would guess male. I didn''t see any breasts. It had so much hair between its legs that I couldn''t make out any sex organs.In closing, I can honestly say that they scare me. The thing is as powerful as a big bull elk and could rip your arms off easily. And their color could hide them in any woods in the northwest easily. This is a very intellegent animal by its movements, its no wonder they can hide from man so easily. Their hearing is as good as a deer''s. I don''t know about their sense of smell.

    " We were walking (my hunting partner and I) down the road trying to spot a grouse that we had just seen fly from the area of the swamp to the timber across the road from it. We were standing on the north side of the road looking up in the trees and trying to figure how to get off the road in the dense underbrush to get a shot at the grouse. I got a funny fealing that something was watching us and could smell a strong smell kinda like a wet elk. (That season was open too and that was basically why we were hunting). I turned around and walked to the other side of the road away from Joe and looked in at the swamp.<BR><BR>I didn''t see anything at first, then I saw something very big move. It looked like the back of a bull elk so I spun around and gave a loud whisper to my partner (ELK)! By the time he walked the half dozen steps or so from where he was, to me the thing had stood up. I know it heard me even though I know I was pretty quiet. It scared the heel out of me when it did this. I knew right there and then it wasn''t an elk.<BR><BR>As it stood up, it came from a position from squating between it''s legs to a full stance. Just then he saw it and remarked to me, \"what the hell is that thing\"? I said you ain''t gonna believe this but that is a Bigfoot. He was worried about our safety and said, should we shoot it? Can we kill it? I said I don''t think we should, we might get in big trouble with the law and he had been there before.<BR><BR>So we watched it for a few minutes. It was very warry of us and kept rocking back and forth nervously. If we made any movements it would duck it''s head a few inches and stare at us. He was worried about it attacking us. It made a posturing movement like it meant business so I said let''s shoot into the road and see if we can scare it off, so we did and it did. It took off like a bat outta hell in the direction away fro us. He said, ain''t nobody in hell gonna believe us, they''ll lock us up in the nutt house if we do. We agreed right there and then to stay silent. This happened in the mid 1980''s and I haven''t said anything about it to anyone but the wife and kids and a few people I trust. ",

    " I was out in the spring of the year scouting around for turkeys on the southern side of Jacks Mountain near the small village of Ellen Chapel (close to Lewistown).  I heard a type of clucking sound in a thick, brushy area and walked closer to investigate.  The clucking sound caught my attention because it sounded kind of like a turkey.  What was odd, however, was that a turkey would let me approach that closely.  As I got closer to the clucking sound, I heard a very low, gutteral growl coming from the brush.  I couldn''t see anything.  This growl really surprised and scared me.  I began walking away, but then curiosity got the better of me and I approached the area slowly again.  Once again, as I got closer, the low growl occurred.  Black bears are commonly seen around this area, but I can''t imagine that a black bear would simply hold still that close to a human and growl.  Whatever was growling at me was very well concealed because I couldn''t see a thing.  So after hearing this growl two or three times, I got freaked out and left.  The only other explanation I can think of--and the one I''ve held to for the last 25 years--is that there was another turkey hunter out in the woods, well camoflauged, who was messing with me.  I''ve never told anyone about this incident.  I started reading accounts here of people being growled at from thick brush and thought my experience might be of the same nature.  ",

My friend and I looked at each other and said what was that. <BR><BR>We both are very familiar with the animals of Pa. I have had bobcats circle me at night and often heard thier cry while camping. <BR><BR>Niether of us have ever heard a noise like that. Except for us there was complete quiet after the roar. <BR><BR>94. One of my hobbies is rock climbing. I like to scout for unclimbed rock . I was told by a friend that there was some large cliffs behind his house on 655 which borders the Game Land. <BR><BR>I hiked up what passed for a trail through steep dense cover. The rocks are visible from the road and looked promising.<BR><BR>I was dissapointed to find the rock to be loose and steppy. Not what rock jock wants after a very tough bushwack.<BR><BR>Being a hunter I was also checking game sighns. <BR><BR>I found 4 or 5 deer within 100 yards or so of each other did not appear to be shot or attacked by dogs but abdominal cavities were open. <BR>",

At about 9:00 p.m. we had our first bite and ended up being a 15 minute fight to end up being a turtle.  Shortly after at approximately 9:30 p.m. we heard what sounded like our first wood knock.  Personally I didn''t believe or didn''t want to believe what I had just heard. But within minutes we all heard the 2nd knock and were all speechless in what we had just heard. After talking about it for a couple minutes we heard another but this time it came from the other side of the river, speechless yet again we all just looked at each other and within seconds we heard another but this time it was right being us and close. That''s when we knew we had to leave.  As we were packing our fishing poles in the car we heard 4 loud aggressive knocks within 30 yards of were we parked. We immediately showed the poles in the car and left.  After getting several miles down the road we stopped and said let''s go back and try and get it on video because know one would believe us. So that''s what we did and we got 3 knocks on video.",

    " <BR>I have lived in Adams County, PA all of my life except for four years in the U S Navy and four years in college. I read in the Gettysburg Times tonight about your search team that is coming to Adams County. Take my story for what it is worth. <BR><BR>On Thursday nights I would go with my mother to play bingo at the Greenmount Fife Hall on Rt 15 south of Gettysburg. I was about thirteen years old, which would have been the summer of 1961. There were other kids there and we would play hide and go seek and do all the fun stuff kids did back then. Playing bingo wasn''t one of them.The firehall held shooting matches and constructed a target box in the lot behind the fire hall. I hid behind this target box during a hide and go seek game. I remember that it was dark perhaps 10PM and the area was dimly lit by the outsise lights at the firehall. I was backing around the corner of the target box and backed into a big animal. I turned to see what it was and saw this human like figure, a little over five feet tall, not really heavy, covered with hair not like a bear but long like hair on the hooves of Clydesdale horses. I remember the odor as being a musk scent like that of sweat or a deer like musk, very strong. I took off running as fast as I could go to tell the others. They or nobody else believed me and when we went back to see if anything was really there we found nothing. <BR><BR>I often thought of that event but convinced myself that a sasquatch would not be found in a populated area such as this.

    " The sighting occurred awhile ago.  So long that I am not sure of the year, but I would guess Jan or Feb of 1998.  The reason I am reporting it now is because I was watching the History Channel, and the animal they displayed was very similar, with a few exceptions.  The hair was even over the body, the History Channel display was baggy at the ankles and narrow at the knees.  The eyes were definitely very red.  The time of the incident was approximately 1AM in the morning.  The importance is the animal was no more than 150 feet from me, and I stopped the car and the animal and I stared at each other for quite a long time, until I got tired and left the scene.<BR><BR>\tDetails:  My wife and I were returning home from a friends home in Gettysburg PA along Route 116 between Gettysburg and Fairfield.  In front in my headlights, I saw this animal step over a fence and walk across the road, West to East.  The animal stopped in the middle of the field and looked back at the car, and I stopped the car to observe.<BR><BR>\tThe reason this was not reported sooner is because we did not know how to report the event, and until reading your Web Page, I did not realize how prevalent the sightings are.<BR><BR> ",

    " Hello,<BR><BR>My name is Doug and though I am very reluctant to post this story; I am going to do so anyways. The area that this happened  could not be a more unlikely area for a bigfoot occurance then or  especially now with all the development of the farmland in the last 25 years which has been extensive and at a phenominal rate. After reading many (if not every last report on this website) and coming across more that a few that have happened in improbable areas (bigfoot running down neighborhood streets and sightings/ vocalizations near condo areas), I decided there just might be some merit in submitting this for review. A skilled researcher might be able to shed some more light maybe.<BR><BR>My friends parents owned a small somewhat defunct farm with (I''m guessing maybe 15-20 acres of land -not the best judge on that) They had 3 horses; 2 mares that were allowed out in the field areas; a stabled stallion, and a pony I believe. The barn was in dis-repair and part of the roof had collapsed years earlier. There was a large pond that was almost completely enclosed with an impenatrable thicket of briars ringing almost the whole cirmcuference of the pond, except for a small area that was kept open for access for the horses to water. Much of the property was overgrown with these same briars that tended to make big circular mounds here and there in the field. The house sat close to the road; the barn to the left and further behind. The extreme left side of their property was bordered by a small stream that edged along a small (100 ft x 30 ft) stand of very dense pine trees. These pines (species unknown) tend to have a very dense understory of almost horizontal dead, dry, branches due to years of growth an minimal sunlight. The lower end of this pine grove had a mowed lawn area (next door neighbors property who were also related to my friend family) You had to access the camping area through the neighbors propery as the overgrowth of briars and other weeds, brambles, trees made it impossible to get there directly for the E------- property. The pond in relation to the campsite was to the left if you were looking back up towards the road; with the stream running between. The dense pine grove then lay between you and the road; unless you skirted around it through the neigbors backyard.<BR><BR>This is what happened. No sighting but a vocalization.<BR><BR>We had gone down to the campsite had built a fire and been down there for about an hour. During this time we all felt uneasy even though we had been there before many times. This is a long time ago but to the best of my memory we had been joking; probably made something to eat over the fire but something felt really wrong this time. \"Wrong\" is the best word I can use to describe. I remember I felt like I couldn''t just sit down by the fire and stay with the conversation though. From back in the pine grove was the occasional, deliberate braking of branches that were just a little too large (to the sophisticated human ear) and just had the sound of being \"up off the ground some ways\" This would start and stop. We would listen and comment on it. First we thought maybe the mares had gotten back into the woods, unusual but this later was confirmed not to be so because we found out the next day that they were stabled for the night. We then thought it might be some older boys who were trying to scare us into running. It would be quiet for awhile then there would be a sense of movement closer to where we were and then receeding. We shined a flashlight and ventured back alittle ways but saw or smelled nothing. The sounds began again this time definately agitated, insistent with a very permiable feeling. We started to get un-nerved  moved out into the neighbors backyard. The sound grew louder, with traceable movement and then this ear splitting scream cut right out into the night. One loud shriek louder than anything should have to be. It just cut right to the core of your soul. Like so many reports I''ve read on this website, it''s virtually impossible to do it justice with a human description precisly because it sounded so inhuman. We just ran like hell back to the house, left everything behind. No sense of being followed at all. No visual sighting (I almost wish). No bad smells or odors. In terms of other reports this pales, I know. But this is what happened and I never forgot it. We knew what Sasquatch were at the time, but no one ever heard of sightings east of the Mississippi to the best of my memory then. We kind of joked that maybe that''s what our unseen friend was. Years later when I read and saw the reports from the southern part of York County (report on file with your website.) did I ever give any serious thought.",

    " I was very young, about 6 or 7 years old I guess. My cousin and I were out and about 1/2 mile from my parents'' house in Coganhouse Township. The nearest landmark I can think of is Fry''s Turkey Ranch restaurant at the top of Steam Valley Mountain. <BR><BR>The area we were in was a grassy one, with forest on three sides, and a small stream which ''y'' ed into a larger one some 100 yds or so from the site, and to the south. This small stream, so we though, would be a perfect place to make a holding pool for trout, so we decided to build one about halfway from the woods to the north, and the larger stream it fed into. <BR><BR>There is a swampy area just to the northeast of the site, with a few trees surrounding it, and a couple of large rocks. The forest to the east is comprised of thick trees somewhat, with the area around the swamp slightly less dense. There are small bushy type trees dotted along the small stream, with another grassy area just behind, and before the thick forest to the east. <BR><BR>There is a built watershed to the northwest, about 30 yds from the site, which hasn''t been of any real use for quite some time. I suppose it is pretty much in ruin by now. <BR><BR>There are traces of what once used to be a dirt road running over the hill to the west, and down into the site area, then curving back up and to the northwest beside the watershed, as well as to the south toward the larger stream. <BR><BR>We had begun by digging out the area we intended to use, and had placed some rocks to form a dam. My cousin decided that the rocks we were using were too small, and that there were probably bigger ones downstream around the larger of the two streams. He informed me that he was going to look for them, and left me there to continue on with the building of the dam with the rocks we had. <BR><BR>He was gone about fifteen minutes or so, when I noticed that the water running into the dammed part I was working on, was as muddy as the water running out and on downstream. The current wasn''t really swift, as this stream was fed by a spring, and coming from the forest to the north. I looked to see what was causing the water to be so dirty, and when I turned my head back to the east, I saw this large hairy creature standing just across the stream from me, about 6 or 7 feet away I guess. It was massive. Hair covered it from head to toe, with a bald-like face. It''s eyes were dark, and It made no movements toward me or away. This creature was pretty quiet for being so big. I was terrified, and sat frozen, only able to stare into \"it''s\" eyes. I couldn''t move, and could barely breathe, so yelling for help was out of the question. I am older now, but I still sometimes get frightened whenever I tell> someone about that day. It stood there for what seemed like minutes, and when I looked away finally to scream for my cousin, I guess it left. When I looked back after a second or two of yelling, \"it\" was gone.<BR> <BR>We didn''t stick around to check for prints, as after I told my cousin what had occurred, we got out of there as fast as we could. My mother didn''t believe me when I begged her to get the gun and go out there with me after it. Since then though, I have changed my mind about the method of finding the creature. I believe that the only way this being should be trophied is by camera or just by plain sight.<BR> <BR>We didn''t go back to that area for about a week, and the summer ended. My cousin would come to my house for a week at a time, and we would go out and do all sorts of things in the woods. We are both educated on the woods, and we know a bear when we see one. We have trapped together, fished, hunted, and ridden motorcycles in that area during our childhood. I know this creature wasn''t a bear, or anything else I had ever seen before. Since then I have never gone into the woods without some sort of defense, whether it be a rifle, axe, bow or sword, I never have been out there without something since. I was just that scared. <BR><BR>Daniel Burkhart <BR> <BR>> <BR>> <BR>",

    " Was out late one night walking my Beagle before retiring for the night.  We live in a somewhat rual area, the village of Orangeville has a population of about 600 or so.<BR><BR>Because of the town make up at that time, very few people were up at that hour.  so, in walking west up the road with the mountain to the north of us, all the hoses on the hill were dark and quiet with ony a dog or two barking.<BR><BR>I had walked my dog about 300 yards up the road, about 200 yards away from the closest house.  At this point the woods coming down from the mountain are right next to the road.<BR><BR>We had just stoped and were beginning our walk back to the house when my dog stoped and looked up  at the mountain.  His hair on his back stood up and he started growling.  I looked up to where he was staring and didn''t see any kind of movement or hear or smell anything different.<BR><BR>After about 10 seconds I tried to coax the dog into heading back to the house, but he did not move. About 30 seconds after the dog first stoped I heard a howel / scream of something that I have never heard before.  It seemed to come down off the mountain, it didn''t sound close by, so I figured the sound to come somewhere in front of us about 1/2 or near the top of the mountain.<BR><BR>The sound, similar sounding to the one at http://www.bluenorth.com/klamath_recording.htm made all my hairs stand on end, and my dog made a protective stance between me and the sound.  The sound lasted for about 20 seconds or less with the echo through the woods.  Several of the dogs on the hill also began barking when the sound came down off the moountain.<BR><BR>At the time I had no idea what I had heard, I coaxed my dog to move and we went back down to the house and turned in for the night.  Since that night I havn''t heard any other sounds like that.<BR><BR>The next morning when I took the dog up for his morning walk, I stoped in the area where we had heard the sound.  the dog acted normally and I looked for any kind of animal tracks but didn''t notice anything along the road edge or just inside the woods.<BR><BR>It wasn''t untill a few months later that when I was watching Sightnings and they played the recording of a possible Big Foot scream from Washington state that I realized I had heard the same sound in Pennsylvania just a few months previous.<BR><BR>At that time I really didn''t know of anyone to report it too, and also figured no one would beleive that I had heard such a sound.<BR><BR>It wasn''t untill a recient TV show on TLC about bigfoot that I dediced to do some more research and find a location to log my sighting.",

    " Sighting was seen in 1991 in Blue Mountain Berks County PA.  State Game Land 110 I believe in early February.  I was grouse hunting on the top of the mountain, there was ten to twelve inches of snow with a half to one inch of ice on top of the snow.  It was very difficult to puncture your feet to walk through the snow and ice.  I shot my grouse, on top of the mountain about a half to 3/4 of a mile from where we came up to the top of the mountain.  I shot twice after my friend with me yelled grouse, I yelled I got it to my friend who then proceeded to walk up to me.  He was 75yds away and it took him about 15-20min to get up to me.  Then he walked a trail that went back to where the road starts at the top of the mountain.  I stood there for 15 min. as I heard my friend walking away from me,afer I could hear his footsteps no more, I turned the other direction and was looking at the side of the mountain that we came up.  I noticed a dark figure running along the ridge of the top of the mountain, for 50 to 100yds. it ran, there was an opening and it stoped.  Then it proceeded to run straight for me uphill and did not stop until it was about 40 to 50ft away from me.  It was not out of breath and did not make a sound and just stood there and looked at me for about 1-2min. and then walked away in the direction that it came from.  First of all in those conditions you could not run or barely walk in it.  It was hard to puncture the ice on top of the snow to walk let alone run.  It went through it like it wasn''t even there for 200yds and when it stopped 50ft away, you couldn''t even see it breath or hear it breathe.  He ran that distance, in about 1-3min maybe.  It scared the hell out of me i wasn''t sure what it was, until it stopped right in front of me.  It found me I wasn''t looking for it.  And I can tell that when he stopped in the opening on the ridge that he can see blaze orange because he ran faster then straight for me after he seen me in my blaze orange one piece outfit.  He was there in no time at all, running uphill a 100 to 150yds.  He walked away and looked back at me once and then kept going.  He was all black, very long hair, it was hard to see his face through the hair.  Tall around 7-7 1/2ft 400-500lbs I thought. Very powerful animal seemed very intelligent because I think he heard the gunshots or the yelling and wanted to find who was making the noise on the mountain and came right to me.  I was scared at first and when it stopped, I put my shotgun right on it at 45-50ft and it didn''t even flinch it wasn''t scared and it just walked away.  My friend with me is 6''1 200lbs and when I told him what happened, he didn''t believe me but he tried to run on the road at the top of the mountain on level ground, flat, he took 3 steps and fell on his face.",

I glanced away from the beams and when I looked back at the road I was coming to the bottom of a dip in the road and as I looked back at the road I saw TWO VERY LARGE LEGS WITH EXTREMELY LARGE FEET ATTACHED ! I saw three strides and it was across the road and the fourth step took it up a 7 foot bank. The fur appeared to be long and very dark, almost black but with a bit of a sheen to it. The fur appeared to go all the way to the ground around the feet. Because I was approaching the bottom of the dip, my headlights were only catching the very bottom of where the road came back up and he was at the very top of my headlight beams. I backed up and pulled out a light, looked for tracks through my car window. even though I am an experienced hunter and tracker, I felt goose bumps and the hair on the back of my neck was standing up and I left after I locked the doors. I''ve seen many bears, three mountain lions, a fisher and many other wild animals in many areas. This was not a four legged creature. ",

Just to state a fact of point,my mini-blinds were white, down all the way and the blinds themselves were folding downward,so,anyone outside can see in,but,if they are up you can''t see in. Mind you,Our moble home is 14'' high and 70''long on two acres of land in a rual area.outside of Montrose,PA. We sold our property in Feb.2008.<BR>I never went outside to investigate what I saw, I figured that I would leave well enough alone,just let whatever it was be on it''s intended journey.

    "  Here goes, I guess depending upon how you look at it I am either the luckiest person where Bigfoot is concerned or unfortunate in that coming forward in some people''s eyes makes me either a story teller or a nut.  My sighting occured on a 1968 family camping trip near the Delaware River in Tohickon Valley Camp Grounds in Bucks County, PA.  I was 16 yrs old. I rode by bike over to explore the newest camping area that was as yet unfinished. As I rode through a clearing down a dirt road I had the unnerving feeling I was being watched from the bushes.  I told myself that I was being silly and proceeded to ride into the entrance tree covered area. I noticed the new bathhouse, wanted to check it out and parked my bike along side a split rail fence.  After finding the door locked I turned around to go back to my bike and that is when I saw not 8 ft away the most frightening and butt ugly creature I have ever seen.  It was standing upright on the other side of the split rail fence.  It had both hands on the top railing all the while shifting its weight back and forth rocking from side to side. I could clearly see the face in the sunlight but details of the body were lost in the shadow of the shade of the trees. It had a wild eyed look upon its face with the body language being restless. I must have been in shock as I calmly decided to get the heck out of there and back on my bike. When I got back to the our camp site I wanted to tell someone but I didn''t even believe what I had just saw. I had no point of reference except that it was about 5''5 and monkeyish looking but not human. After I got home I wanted to tell my Mom or Dad or neighbor but was afraid they would make fun of me or think I was crazy. I kept asking myself how I was going to sleep that it would cause me nightmares. So I decided then and there to put it out of my consciousness. Everytime I thought how frightened I was, I pushed it out of my mind. Eventually I succeeded. Fast forward to 2002 and I find your BFRO website. (It has taken me another 5 years to get up the courage to write this report). I never gave it much thought about Bigfoot and Washington/Oregon state but it was interesting to see that this research was genuine and scientifically based.  I was surprised to see so many reports here in PA. As I was reading about other sightings one night, the memory of that camping experience came flooding back with the realization that I had come face to face with a Bigfoot. Upon reflection, I now realize that I have had three more encounters (1978-Bucks,1997 and 2005-Berks County).         ",

    " I was driving back from work late on Tuesday the 25th of February and I''ll never forget what I saw. As I was driving down Green Lane towards Levitown a giant creature that I can only describe as a Sasquatch. The creature was standing on two feet and had almost a human like form except for its nearly 9 foot stature. As it crossed in front of my car I could see it more clearly in my headlights, it was a very dark brown, but it was more like hair than fur which I found to be even stranger. It couldn''t have taken more than three steps to completely cross the road. As I swerved it was already nearly off the road all I could see though my drivers window were what seemed to be piercing blue eyes that seemed to glow. Though I could not differentiate if they were glowing or if it was a reflection of the moon. I haven''t been able to sleep much since, all I can think about is those piercing eyes. Once I found this website and read of the sightings, I knew I had to share what I saw. I''ve been looking online for another explanation, but I can''t find anything. ",

    " WELL I CANT BELIEVE AFTER ALL THESE YEARS IM DOING THIS BUT DUE TO THE RECENT TRAGEDY I HAVE A NEW RESPECT FOR HOW SHORT LIFE CAN BE,AND I THINK LEGITIMATE RESEARCHERS NEED TO HEAR ABOUT AN EXTRAORDINARY OCCURANCE THAT HAPPENED IN MY LIFE.  I KNOW EVEN THE MOST BELIEVING OF YOU ARE GOING TO THINK THIS IS BULLSHIT, BUT AS THE SAYING GOES TRUTH IS STRANGER THEN FICTION:<BR><BR>   IT WAS IN 1976 IN LEVITTOWN PA.  MY FRIEND  AND I SKIPPED SCHOOL (I WAS 16).  WE WERE GOING TO HUNT THE THIOKAL PROPERTY WITH BOWS.  THIS ACTUALLY IS THE MOST INCREDIBLE PART OF THIS, THE THIOKAL PROPERTY IS LOCATED IN THE MIDDLE OF LEVITTOWN THE MODEL FOR SUBURBIA.  THE<BR>PROPERTY WAS A FENCED WITH BARBED WIRE ENCLOSURE ABOUT A MILE SQUARE EACH WAY WITH A ROAD ON THE PERIMETER THAT ARMED GUARDS WOULD PATROL.  SO MY FRIEND AND I PLAYED COMMANDO ,SNEEKING UNDER THE FENCE WITH DIRT ON OUR FACES WEARING CAMO SHIRTS.  WE DID THIS BECAUSE IT WAS THE ONLY PLACE TO HUNT OR TRAP AND THE PROPERTY WAS EXCELLENT, SWAMPS, RAVINES, FLAT FIELDS AT THE TOP,HEAVY OLD WOODS,  GREAT DIVERISITY(BY THE WAY I DONT KNOW IF THIS IS THE INFO YOU WANT BUT I THINK YOU NEED TO KNOW THIS BUT BECAUSE I THINK ITS PERTINANT).  ANYWAY WE SNUCK IN AND WERE HUNTING SQUIRRELS WITH BOWS.  MY FRIEND JUST SHOT ONE OUT OF A TREE AND WAS BENDING DOWN TO CUT OFF ITS TAIL WHEN I SAW (I WAS LOOKING OUT FOR THE GUYS IN THE JEEPS) A BIGFOOT.   IT WAS REALLY CLOSE ABOUT 100-120 FEET AWAY.  IT WAS JUST STANDING THERE WITH ONE ARM HOLDING ONTO A PIECE OF TREE CHEWING IT (IVE SINCE COME TO REALIZE (AFTER SEEING A COW) IT WAS CHEWING IT LIKE AN UNGULATE SIDE TO SIDE I MEAN IT WAS EATING IT, CHEWING AND BITING OFF NEW PIECES .I WAS FROZEN WITH FEAR.   MY FRIEND WAS BUSY WITH THE SQUIRREL SO I WATCHED IT FOR 20 SECONDS?  IT DOESNT SOUND LONG BUT IT SEEMED LIKE FOREVER.  I GOT AN EXCELLENT LOOK  AT IT - 7 FOOT TALL MAYBE JUST A LITTLE MORE-REDDISH/BROWN HAIR 3-4 INCHES LONG.  THE THING I REMEMBER MOST WAS THE FACE BECAUSE IT WAS EATING.   I GUESS IT LOOKED ALMOST HUMAN IF IT WASNT SO TALL AND COVERED WITH HAIR .  IT COULD HAVE BEEN SOME DEFORMED PERSON.  I THOUGHT A CROSS BETWEEN A GORILLA FACE AND HUMAN WITH BIG LIPS FLATTENED TYPE NOSE (NEGROID TYPE I GUESS THATS THE RIGHT DESCRIPTION NOT MEANING TO BE DEROGATORY).  IT JUST STOOD THERE LOOKING AT US.  I GRABBED MY FRIEND AND YELLED  LOOK! HE GOT UP AND PICKED UP THE BOW AND AN ARROW AND SAID ''WERE GONNA BE RICH''.   HE WAS GOING TO KILL IT.  I LOOKED BACK AT IT.   IT STILL DIDNT MOVE  - NOT A MUSCLE, SHOWED NO FEAR AT ALL , COMPLETELY CALM,KEPT CHEWING .  ANYWAY IT LIKE SOMEHOW TELEPATHICALLY TALKED TO ME AND SAID-IF YOU HURT ME IM GOING TO KILL YOU BOTH.  I FREAKED OUT AND STARTED SCREAMING '' ITS GONNA KILL US,  ITS GONNA KILL US''  AND GRABBED THE BOW OUT OF HIS HANDS .  WE THEN TURNED AND RAN FOR OUR LIVES.<BR>WE TOLD OUR PARENTS WHO SAID QUOTE WHAT ARE YOU GUYS SMOKING.  ANYWAY,  BECAUSE OF THE UNBELIEVABLE CURCUMSTANCES (MAINLY THIS WAS A CHEMICAL PLANT WITH ARMED GUARDS)  WE THOUGHT MAYBE THE GOVERMENT WAS INVOLVED OR SOMETHING AND WE DIDNT TELL ANYONE FOR YEARS.  I HAVE TALKED TO SOMEONE WHO WORKED THERE AT THE TIME AND THEY SAID THEY DID WORK FOR GOVERMENT- JET FUEL ADDITTIVE-WHEN I TOLD HER ABOUT BIGFOOT  SHE LAUGHED AND SAID THEY HAD NO BIGFOOTS.  (I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS CAPTURED ONE/TRAINED OR SOMETHING) .  SINCE THEY HAD ARMED GUARDS PATROL, ONLY PLAUSIBLE EXPLANATION I''VE COME UP WITH WAS A PERSON DRESSED UP IN HOLLYWOOD QUALITY BIGFOOT COSTUME TO TRY TO SCARE US AWAY.  THAT DOESNT EXPLAIN THE TELEPATHIC ENCOUNTER.  I THINK IVE SPENT A LONG TIME TRYING TO RATIONALIZE<BR>THIS AND HAVENT COME UP WITH ANY REASONABLE EXPLAINATION <BR>",

It was winter time and it was also in the evening around 7 p.m. and raining. They were driving down route 24 near the Angola light when something ran across the road on all fours. Then when it got across the road to the field they both said it stood up and it had red eyes. I just started to watch the television show finding bigfoot and remembered that night and called my brother up again to get the details to see if I remembered it right.",

    " I was coming home from a night class at Del. Tech.  I usually take a back road over to route 9 to get home faster.  So i left college and made my way home on my normal backroad detour.  I got throught the first half of the twisted road and came up on the stop sign to turn right on to Asbury road.  As i did i turned on my high beams.  I came around a turn that leads to about a quater-mile, or a little more, stretch of road.  About 3/4 of the way down the road i could make out a standing figure next to a utility pole.  So immeadiatly i turned off my high beams, thinking it was a person because it was standing up.  As i got closer to this being i was taken back by its size.  I started to slow down not knowing it, i guess because i was puzzled and curious.  As i stared I could make out its bottom side, broad shoulders, the fact that it was standing with its back to me looking into the woods, and hair that came to a point at the top of its head.  This entire figure had a thick black cover of hair, with no hair on its hands.   I could not see its feet.  Standing next to the utility pole gave me some reference for height.  I estimate it was aorund 7 to 8 ft tall.  I was almost past this creature when it looked at me and then looked back to the woods as if it did''nt care i was there.  Once i made eye contact the hair on my arms stood up and i peeled out of the location.  I was confused as to what just happened and could''nt believe what i witnessed.  It also is hard to comprehend that i have seen a bigfoot and I have seen something that does''nt exist. ",

    " BACKGROUND<BR>My 18-year old son and I departed Cape Henlopen State Park on the Atlantic Coast near Lewes, Deleware at about 1:30AM, June 7, 2003, after a day of fishing from the park''s 1/4 mile long pier. We had intended to catch a couple of hours sleep in my extended cab pickup before starting the two-hour return trip to our home outside of Annapolis, Maryland.  However, we both managed to catnap in our fishing chairs throughout the day, did not feel the least bit tired, so decided to depart immediately for home.  Route 404 is the most direct route from Lewes to the Chespeake Bay Bridge and Annapolis, meandering though the Deleware and Maryland countryside, with only two small-to-middle sized towns (Denton and Georgetown) along the route.  The remainder of Rt. 404 is bordered by farmland (chicken and dairy production) and woodlands.<BR><BR>DETAILS<BR>I was driving and my son was in the passenger seat. We departed the park via Rt. 9, headed north a short distance on Rt. 1, and picked up Rt. 404 West . There was very little traffic on this secondary road at this time of morning, so I drove with my highbeams on and set the cruise control. Within a few minutes I saw a movement along the right side of the road about 100 yards ahead and began braking.  A doe stepped onto the berm of the road and crossed from right to left. I continued braking, almost to a complete stop, in case more deer followed the doe, but she apparently was alone.  Another few minutes passed before we saw a car approaching from the opposite direction. We could see its headlight glow before we could see the car itself because we were approaching a gentle curve in the road to the right. I flicked my headlights to lowbeam and in a matter of a few seconds saw the silhouette of a large biped cross the road, from the center part of the road, across our lane of travel, and enter the woods to our right some 100-150 feet ahead.  My son immediately exclaimed, \"What the heck was that?!?! I asked him if he saw it too and he said, \"Yes, there were two of them!\" \"Two??, I asked and he said, \"Yes, a tall one in front and a shorter one 4-5 feet behind.\"  My truck has almost slowed to a complete stop by this time because my foot was on the brake as soon as I first spotted the creature.  My son and I slowly drove by the spot where they appeared to enter the woods, but we could see nothing.  The car that was approaching passed us at this point, without slowing down or stopping.  I asked my son to describe what he saw. He said a large thing walking on two legs with another, shorter thing following behind. He added that the shorter one was about chest high on the larger one.  My son is near 6'' tall and he said the larger one was taller than him.  I saw the taller one, side profile, as a silhouette -- almost a shadow.  It moved across the road quickly, in a purposeful manner.  I could see no arms or arm swing.  It did not turn its hear to look toward us.  I could discern no color or body features beyond a head, torso, and legs. There was no accompanying odor.  When we passed what we believed to be the creatures'' entry point in the woods, my son''s passenger side window was completely down and mine was partially down. A normal moist, woodsy night time odor was all we noticed.<BR>Additional observation by my son, in his own words: My father saw one thing cross the road, while I saw two.  I use the word \"thing\" because I truly have no idea what I saw cross the road that night. They were NOT quadrupeds. The larger one walked upright and at a smooth pace...no bouncing around. It didn''t seem to speed up as our truck approached. When the oncoming car drew closer to the curve in the road, I then saw the second, shorter one in the glow of the other car''s headlights. This second, shorter thing followed closely behind the larger thing. I could see that it wasn''t standing straight up, like the larger one, but was slightly leaning forward. The siloette of both things appeared fuzzy, like a picture out of focus. My Dad said he didn''t see arms or arms moving, but I could see long arms moving back and forth on both things. The arms didn''t move very much, but I could see them. I don''t mean to make a joke out of what we saw, but the big thing could have looked Yao Ming, the Texas basketball player from China, eye-to-eye.<BR><BR>COMMENTS<BR>When I first put this encounter down on paper, I described what I saw as a shadow, not as a silhouette.  While silhouette might be a more appropriate word, I cannot put the illusion of a shadow out of my mind.  After talking this over with my son, we believe that the creatures that we saw did, in fact, have hair on the body and that a combination of (back)lighting from the car approaching in the opposite direction and my own lowbeam headlights caused the outline of the creature that I saw appear shadowy or diffused --perhaps a result of light shining on or though its hair. This, perhaps, can be supported by my son''s description of the silhouette of both creatures appearing fuzzy or out-of-focus.      ",

    " Our family was driving home from vacation last August when I saw something unusual in a cornfield. We were roughly 40-45 minutes north of Bethany Beach, Delaware traveling on Route 1 passing through farm country at the time.  We had rented a minivan and my husband was seated upfront driving with his Father next to him in the passenger''s seat. They were busy talking.  My daughter and mother-in-law were seated in the row of seats behind them.  My mother-in-law was reading a book to my daughter at the time.  I was seated in the very last row of seats in the minivan and sat on the passenger''s side of the car.  <BR><BR>As we were driving along and everyone else was busy either talking or reading, I was looking out the window at the passing countryside.  We were going through farm country at the time and as we drove past one corn field, something caught my eye.  The thing that initially got my attention was the fact that the corn stalks were now dried and yellow and it appeared that something dark brown was standing there in the middle of the corn stalks.  The roadway was slightly elevated above this particular field so I was essentially looking down onto the tops of cornstalks rather than them being level with the van.  <BR><BR>Having an interest in the subject of Bigfoot, I immediately went into observation mode and noted the following:  What I saw was medium to dark brown in color, it was taller than the cornstalks, it appeared to be about 3 feet wide and I may have been looking at a head and shoulders and it definitely wasn''t a piece of farm equipment, a scarecrow or a human.  In fact, I noted that there were no humans around on the farm at the time.  I was able to observe this for roughly 5-10 seconds as our minivan drove past this large field.  The brown \"thing\" was roughly 300 feet in off the road in the cornfield by itself.<BR><BR>I quickly tried to note the general location of where we were at the time.  I do not live in Delaware and was not familiar with the precise location.  However, not long after that, I spotted a sign for the Milton, Delaware exit off of Route 1.",

    " My father and mother were vacationing in the Mt. St. Helens area last summer (June 98) when Dad pulled over at a washed out creek up past the Lava Canyon to video tape the creek where the explosion from the St. Helens blast washed out the creek. He was video taping on a small bridge where the road crosses the creek, narrating what he was seeing. He said, while standing there taping, he could hear beating of stick on wood from the forest to the left and a return pounding from the stand of trees to the right. He progressed further onto the bridge to hear for sure that it was not an echo, which he was very confident it was not.<BR><BR>Further, since it was midday on a weekday, traffic in the area was none existant and no people had been seen for miles around. Nor were there any electrical lines or etc. in the area, nor work crews, nor loggers, nor hikers that would have been making these noises. My father is not easily scared, I mean that, and he was worried a bit about his safety at this point because of his certainty that the two separate noises were being generated in communication with one another, (left then right, then left at random spaces not exceeding moments apart). He had the video camera rolling throughout the experience and when I reviewed it the pounding noises of wood on wood are audible on the tape, if somewhat indiscernable.<BR><BR>I then interviewed my Dad on my camera that evening to document the occaision. I might add that he said the stick being used to pound the trees or whatever was a heavy (thick) stick that made a deeper sound than the crack of a small stick would make, (hinting that the size of whom ever were pounding must be considerable). Dad stopped rolling tape and got back in the idling truck fearing for his further safety. We have a copy of the tape he made and the interview I made. I would like an audiologist to examine his recording to single out this beating noise and record the intervals and strengths of the beats.",

    " I lived at Scenic near Stevens Pass Washington in the 60--70''s.  There had been sightings of sasquatch near our home, and at that time my husband and I laughed about that never taking them seriously.  I lived at Scenic about 10 years and enjoyed taking walks by myself with my samoyed dog. That dog would chase bears away, running them up trees. I always felt safe with her around.  One morning, the dog went with my husband to work and I decided to take a walk down to the end of the road towards highway 2. It was a beautiful spring day and the snow still lay in places on the ground.  I can still see and hear this like it was yesterday.<BR><BR>I had crossed the small bridge going over the small creek by our place and gotten almost to the end of the road where it meets the highway.  That''s when I heard the most god awful sound.  I can still hear it in my mind. The sound was quite close to me. I''m thinking about 1/2 block distance (as the crow flys) and seemed to be coming around the area where the deserted railroad bunkhouses were located across where the depot was located.<BR><BR>This animal had huge lungs. The volume was immense.<BR>(I''m trying to think of a word for the sound) It started sort of like roar and went to a shrill pitch. Then a pause of about 3 seconds and then the same sound with that shrill pitch, a pause of 3 seconds and another sound.<BR><BR>That was it and since I didn''t believe in saquatch I wasn''t scared of it, ,just curious. I knew all the calls of the animals around our mountains and this wasn''t the same. I''ve tried all these years to figure out what made that noise. I stopped into the forest service office after this happen and asked them if they had ever heard this sound. I was trying to explain it to them as best I could, but they never took me serious. I recieved the same response from my friends that lived in skykomish.  Then after I moved to Spokane some time later I was watching \"Unsolved Mysteries\". They played sounds that sounded very similar and said to myself \"there''s the sound or closest to it\".  I thought, \"no one''s going to believe this!\"<BR><BR>I worked at a hospital in Spokane and one of my indian patients and I got to talking about my experience. She had seen a sasquatch come into her camp as a young girl and chased it away by beating on a drum. She said the most astounding thing she remembered about her experience was the human look in it''s eyes. So the native americans have known about them for years.<BR><BR>I truly think the sasquatch would be found around that area of Scenic, near Stevens Pass Washington. For 10 years I walked all through those mountains, my small children with me and these sasquatches never bothered us.",

    "General Location: A government operated wildlife research station in a major river drainage which empties into the Chesapeake Bay.The **** was established as a wildlife research refuge in 1936. Prior to 1936, it was a large privately owned family estate (since the 18th century) and partially owned by the defense department in the early 20th century. The refuge area has largely been left untouched and never encroached by development, large scale farming, logging, or citizens. Farming was limited during the 18th century as the family line became very wealthy and used the massive area as a private estate for family members from the 19th century onward.Specific Location: Central Tract (extremely secured, gated and guarded area that is off limits to all citizens that are not employees)This area has been dedicated to bacterial, viral, pesticide, endangered species, natural resources, and migratory bird research for over 50 years. This tract is nationally famous from Rachel Carson''s \"Silent Spring\" book and the research which uncovered and revealed the extreme dangers of DDT and other pesticides. There are many old small research buildings trickled throughout the center portion of the tract. Surrounding the core of research buildings there are lots of very rare trees (true Chestnut trees, next to genetically modified Chestnut trees) and endangered plants. Beyond this core to the east are many mitigation research ponds and closed areas which breed endangered birds. The majority of the central tract is dense forests, streams, rivers and ponds.",

    "Biologist has multiple experiences at government research facility near Laurel",
    :otherstories
    "Yes, there are many incidents in this direct area. Most of the accounts are within a 5-10 mile radius. These accounts seemed to have started in the 1970''s when regional mass development began outside of DC and north towards Baltimore along the I-295/I-95 corridors.I will list some of the accounts which I am familiar with:1. During the 1990s a man driving home from work very early in the AM, spotted a dark bigfoot like creature hunched on the side of route 198 just off of I-95. As he drove past it stood up and ran off along the road jumping the guard rail.2. During the early 2000s, a lot of sightings of a large brownish black creature along the ******** River from I-95 downward into the ****. Government biologists from **** investigated and confirmed it was a black bear. However, many observers said it was bipedal and not on all fours. Many locals around the **** claimed whatever it was took \"refuge\" in the ****.3. Sightings during the building of Arundel Mills Mall in 1999, reported a large dark haired creature on the construction site. This report can be found on many sites and newspapers. This location is 10 miles north.4. On my first day on the job at the ****, I met with my direct manager, a senior staff member, and he said to me (his exact words), \"We do not discuss Bigfoot around here. Got it?\" (I realized instantly he was covering some thing up). He then said, \"We have a citizen in the area that from time to time sends us audio recordings and \"evidence\" that a Bigfoot lives on the ****. He often puts in for permits to come in and investigate. Never speak to him if you see him around the visitor areas.\"5. During my first driving tour through the refuge, a biologist from **** made the following statements to me. (We had reached the security gate which closes off River Road to everyone.) The biologist said to me, \"This is where the Bowie goatman lives you know? or a Bigfoot. That is if you believe in that stuff. And by the way welcome to your research area, have fun.\" I responded with, \"No matter, nothing in nature scares me.\" He then looked seriously at me and said, \"Until you get to see one.\"6. One day, several weeks after starting my work at the refuge, I was eating lunch in the office area that we share with **** police. One of the police said to me, \"Hows it going out in the hinterlands?\" I said, \"Fine. No one bothers me and its quiet out there.\" He then said something to the regards of, \"Seen anything creepy or odd yet? That is a strange area.\" I said, \"No\" (however I had already had strange experiences out there, but I did not want to mention anything in case he was testing me). He then mentioned briefly, \"I saw something like a huge dark bear walking on two legs one late night out on River Road, while doing a very rare drive through. I never went back through that place at night again. Only in the day light now.\" I just smirked and mildly laughed and said, \"Bowie goatman, eh?\" He said nothing after that.",

    "I have one major noteworthy aspect that I feel may be of importance. Before writing this report I did not of even think this was important, but now I do see a correlation.Earlier that same day, in the early morning (at dawn, this is when I started my work everyday), I began for the first time, data collecting on the island which the sounds came from.As I was collecting data on the edge of this very channel between the islands, the loose muddy bank gave way beneath my weight and I fell loudly into the water. I dropped my Geo XT GPS/CPU unit as I hit the water. (Luckily, it was waterproof) As I went under I finally could touch the bottom and push off. The water was about 7 ft deep. Before thinking, I dove back under to retrieve my GPS unit which was day glow yellow (thankfully). Then I struggled for about 2 or 3 minutes grabbing roots and anything to help me climb out.Once I got back up on solid land, I laid there for a minute catching my breath. I was covered head to toe with mud. I started laughing aloud and talking to myself, as I must admit, it was funny. I gathered all my equipment that had remained on dry land and carried everything down to the wide open rock covered beach on the large moving portion of the river.Being as there was no one else out there, I removed all my clothes and washed them off piece by piece in the river. I laid all my clothes out on large rocks to dry under the bright sunlight. I did keep my underwear on however, but nothing else. While my clothes were drying I sat on a large boulder and ate my lunch.I put my clothes back on later even though they were still damp. I remember later that day returning to the office and telling my story. Everyone kept commenting with humor that I smelled like the river and earth. At that time I figured silently to myself, \"what the hell I should just stay the night out there, being my scents were completely gone and I smelled as pure earth.\"So I returned back out there around 5pm after everyone left for the day and my evening story began.",

    " I was camping on the largest of the river islands on the ******** River in the extra restricted area of the ****''s Central Tract. It is an old growth forest. The understory was mostly clear of bushes and brush. I would from time to time camp out overnight there. I always camp with nothing more then a sleeping bag on the ground. While on the refuge I would not light fires, not cook food, not play music; just pure silence, meditation and observation.<BR><BR>Late on this one evening in late July, I heard wood knocking or clapping in the distance from the south portion of the river. I instantly thought of Bigfoot (I must be honest, especially after all the activity I had observed throughout the months prior). I had a large stick with me, so I slapped it against an old tree. At first I heard no reply. I repeated the banging once every few minutes until I did got a response of knocking back. This was in the same location as before. It then returned to silence until about 15 minutes later when another knocking occurred.<BR><BR>About an hour after the wood knocking I heard definite bi-pedal footsteps walking very slowly. The footsteps were obviously coming from something which was being very cautious. The creature was approaching from the south where the wood knocking sounds were coming from. I assumed that it was on the next island downstream (which is separated by a narrow deep channel of water 15 ft across by 6-10 ft deep). I remained silent the whole time as to not scare it off. The next thing I heard was a loud \"kerplunk\" of something falling or dropping into the water channel.<BR><BR>Around 15 minutes later I heard a few faint footsteps walking away back to the south (these steps were not as gentle or cautious as before). It sounded as if it were tired of the game or just leaving because it investigated what I was doing. The rest of the night was silent.<BR><BR>Following morning:<BR><BR>The next morning I went over to the next island at the break of dawn. I found no obvious footprints or evidence.

    "This individual occurrence was on a riverine island on the **** River located in the center of the restricted, non-access preservation area. The island is completely old growth forest which is mostly brush free and wide open under the dense canopies. The old trees (sycamore, white oak, ash, tulip poplar, red oak) are all 40-90 inch DBH (diameter at breast height) with the lowest branches being ~30 ft. or more off the ground. The age range is 150-500 years old.The canopy is so full that it restricts sunlight to the forest floor. Even during the brightest day on the island it feels like dawn or dust. The ground is full of rich black soil and a nice bed of fallen leaves. Scattered throughout the floor are various forms of edible and poisonous mushrooms. Where holes in the canopy allow sunlight in, there is patches of low bush berry, green briar, and other shrub like vegetation.The entire fringe of the island where sunlight reaches all day is full of smaller trees (pawpaw, young ash, oak, birch, maple, sycamore, cherry, holly) and under which is dense shrubs (ivy, lespidesa, barberry, green briar). Beyond the islands edge to the east side is a ~10-15 ft. wide weathered rock covered beach on the river side. On the opposite side to the west is a muddy steep bank which drops into a deep channeled branch of the river (10-15ft deep).This island very commonly has deer and wild turkey passing through and nesting down.Also an abundance of box turtles lives on this island.

We lived up off of Brock Bridge Road parallel to the Baltimore-Washington Parkway and one evening out with the dog out back - our home backed up to woods - I hear a rustling noise behind what was a drainage pond for our community. It was summer and the sun was getting ready to go down so it was dusk-like -- I turned - and by the way so did the dog - our Labrador Retriever -  and could not believe my eyes. I observed a large - I am guessing 10-11 feet high - ape-like figure stalking in the woods behind the pond - I would say it was about 100 yards away.  I just froze - and so did our dog.  No one else witnessed this and we just both stood there for what seemed like 2 minutes - until the creature turned and looked our way and then slowly turned and dashed back off in to the woods....never to be seen again.

    " I am a 44 yr. old woman, I am submitting this in request of my husband & grown son.  As an avid ''birder'' (loves bird watching), I was taking an early morning walk (6:45 a.m.) around Oxbow Lake to see what birds were ''out & about''. <BR><BR>Almost as soon as I started the short trail around the lake, I noticed that there was no activity.....none, no birds, no deer, no squirrels, nothing. This seemed VERY odd to me, because it was a beautiful spring morning, the sun was shining and there wasn''t even the smallest breeze in the air. Then I noticed that the birds weren''t even singing, I could not hear one bird song or call, which is very unusual because there is ALWAYS a lot of bird activity here, especially in the early morning. Then, I noticed that not even the frogs, or the peepers were making any sound...it was complete silence.<BR><BR>When I reached the part of the trail where I usually see deer, there was nothing. It was just about in this area where I started to smell this terrible odor....hard to explain, a strong musky smell, not like a dog or a skunk but a definite heavy odor of musk, one I have never smelled before and I have spent a lot of time in the woods. While I was standing quietly trying to figure out what/where the odor was coming from, a live tree 30-40 ft. high (unknown species) fell about 100-150 ft. from me, it just fell, and there was not even a small breeze that day! I have spent my childhood in the deep woods of Adirondack Mountains. and this just went against every natural law I could think of.....and believe me I tried to rationalize this!<BR><BR>I then had this intense feeling that I was being watched...no more like being stared at, and then I got the sense that perhaps the tree had been pushed, like a warning.<BR>I decided I should start making my way back towards my car, still not hearing or seeing ANY wildlife. Just before getting back in my car I went to an overlook and all of a sudden I heard from the opposite side of the lake a loud howling, it echoed thru the marsh area. After 3-4 deep, loud howls, again silence. I walked back to my car and drove home.",

    " I was bowhunting for deer yesterday (September 17th, 2005) in the swamp bottoms of West River in Churcton, Maryland when I heard what I can only describe as jibberish hollering coming from behind the deer blind that I was in at about 100 yards or so.  It moved east to west hollering jibberish and moving closer and closer to where I was.  I unzipped the back of the deer blind to try and see with my field glasses what was making all that noise and scaring the deer away.  I saw nothing.  The sound was getting closer and I began to feel nervous even though I had permission to hunt there. Thats when the smell of damp musty roadkill mixed with dirty diapers hit me.  I had to exit the deer blind for fresh air and an overwhelming sense of fear gripped me. It was more of a safety issue that made me exit the deer blind and nock an arrow in my bow and leave the area as fast as I could before I came in contact with whatever was making the noise.  I was unnerved by the aggresive tone in the jibberish and hollering.<BR>The fact that it was close by and I could not see it coupled with the smell and the tone of its voice, made me realize that I had best leave the area, and quickly.<BR>As I exited the woods, I walked briskly towards my vehicle and was approximately twenty five yards from my truck when I heard more loud jibberish coming paralell from me about twenty yards in the woods.  Whatever it was was following me and that unnerved me even more and I headed straight for my truck with my bow fully drawn and ready to fire at whatever was stalking me.  Again, I saw nothing.  No movement in the woods and I made my way to my truck and released my draw without shooting my arrow.  I put my bow in the back seat of my Suburban and cranked up my truck and left immediately.  I have never felt that way in the woods in my entire life.  I have hunted bear, wild pig and deer all of my life and never have I ever felt the need to flee the woods.   Until now.<BR>",

    " My friend and I had been searching for a place called Dickerson quarry in Dickerson Md, and had just located it on a map. We had to park on some railroad tracks by the aquaduct and walk through some very dense sticker bushes and overgrowth to find the place. To describe the quarry, it is located in the middle of the woods. It is about 75 yards long and about 30 yards wide with very tall cliffs, about 50 to 80 feet tall in some places. However there are a few places where you can walk down to the waters edge. As we were approaching the quarry, we heard this very loud screeching sound coming from about 25 yards away in the overgrowth. It was very loud and it actually startled us when it first started. The only way to describe the sound would be to say it sounded like a pig getting slaughtered. We stopped walking and waited but it stopped, whatever it was. We continued walking and found the quarry, hearing the strange sound several more times, always coming from a different place. We made a survey and located a place to go down to the waters edge to sit and rest. As we made our way around the quarry we heard the screaming again. Actually coming from the area where we wanted to go! We were not too alarmed though, being curious and stupid. We made it to the waters edge and sat down and started to look around and check the place out. I had picked up a stick off the ground and got out my pocket knife and started to carve on the wood. Suddenly there was a very large splash in the water. It sounded like a person had just jumped in but when I looked up could see ripples in the water where something had gone in. Figuring it was a rock falling from the cliffs we began talking again. About 5 minutes elapsed and we heard another splash. This one bigger and it was very far away from the edge. I asked my freind \"Did you throw something in?\". He said no, he was looking at me. We looked around to see if anyone was there that we didnt see but there was no one anywhere. We sat for about 5 more minutes talking and then heard another big splash. Neither of us saw what made it but the disturbance in the water was so big we guessed it had to be something big! We started to think that someone was in the woods and didnt want us trespassing and was trying to scare us off. However as we started to really think, we became aware there was no way anyone could throw any rock that big, that far. So we made the choice to go ahead and leave. As we were climbing up and out of the quarry another splash came from very near where we had been sitting and also sounded very big. We reached the top and started to make our way to the car. We only walked about 20 feet when something came crashing through the tree branches and hit the ground near us very hard. It sounded like a 20 pound rock hitting the ground. At that point we both stopped walking and turned and really looked hard into the woods. Neither of us saw anything. As we stood there listening, I swear Ive never heard the woods more quite in my life.  We started to walk again and the objects being thrown at us started to get alot more accurate. I remember saying to my freind \"What the hell is going on?\" His response was to tell me GO!!! We took off running and reached our only real obsticle, a creek about 10 feet wide where we had to cross on a log. I went first and he was close behind. As we where halfway across the log something landed in the creek about 5 feet from me that had to be the size of a paint bucket. <BR>I didnt see if it was a rock or what but it was big. At that point I jumped for it and hit the ground running with my freind right on my tail, neither of us looking back. I have never really felt scared like that, but that day I had the thought that we might meet something that was beyond nature and not live to tell about it. <BR> Our journey into the woods took about 30 minutes due to the high growth of pricker bushes, Our journey out took about 3 minutes! We reached the car and the only after the adrenaline wore off <BR>did we realize we both were bleeding nicely from running top speed through summer overgrowth. <BR>At the time, I didnt know about the connection between the rocks being thrown at us and the screaming to bigfoot, but it sounds like a classic case. Ive only been back a few times since then and only in the winter where I can see for 100 yards!!",

    " 11/20/12 I have been keeping my eyes peeled for any potential sign even though I live in a fairly populated area. I live on and drive up and down Carrollton Rd several times a week. What I noticed was a fresh break of a young tree, about 50-60 feet in from the road. Due to brambles, and being private property, I didn''t go in for exact measurements but I''m a pretty good estimator. This break is about 6 feet off the ground, maybe 5, the tree is approximately 4-5 inches in diameter. I noticed that there are significant scrape marks on one the road side of the tree, can''t see the other side, The marks are ONLY below the break. I also found what looks like definite depressions in the leaf litter, with a bit of compressed bare ground, one about 6 feet in from the road at the tree line, and one about 2 feet from the guardrail. I carry a tape measure with me in my car as part of my tools for farriery, so I was able to lay it out at what I believe is the length of the depressions and get pictures. <BR><BR>Of course I couldn''t resist doing a few knocks, there were some good rocks at the roadside so I did one knock, waited about 10 seconds then did two more about 2 seconds apart. I waited about two seconds, stood up, took two steps and heard a response knock!!! It sounded like it was certainly past the hill (top is about 3-500 yards from road) and probably well past that, guessing within a half mile. I waited about 30 seconds, put out a few more knocks, nothing. Couldn''t help a few short whoops, no response.",

    "Carrollton Rd runs a bit east-west at this point, tree break and depressions noted on north side of road, which is a very large (30+? acres) wooded private property, deciduous, lots of leaf litter. Thin brambles at tree line which is about 6-8 feet in from road, then the terrain is sparse undergrowth, with obvious (to me) deer/animal trails but no human made trail. South side, where I parked, has a bank upward about 7 feet (varies) and there is a line of planted pines. Walking up the road about 50 feet and looking around the south side, I did notice a big lay of fallen timber, several old 8-16 inch trunks together that would possibly make a hiding place if needed. This area in general is full of little gully creeks and feeder streams. Despite the presence of homes, I do not find it inconceivable that we may at least have some intermittent squatch traffic around here.",

There were also prints found in other areas of the state park and near Bel Air road. There was even a story I heard about a whole family on Whitt Rd. (right down the street) that had seen an 8 ft. tall creature on their back porch one night watching them eat dinner. When they started screaming, it took off. Also, all my friends and myself have grown up in the woods, and for years weve found mutilated remains of deer strewn everywhere (possibly by cougar) but I have doubts a cougar could do this sort of thing. I''ve also heard stories from a man thats lived in the neighborhood his whole entire life, and when he was younger his friends and him seen what they believed to be a sasquatch numerous times around the power lines, but it''s been a long time since I''ve heard the stories, so I don''t remember the exact details, but I can still get in touch with the man.",

It lies near the road, Piney Orchard Parkway, and railroad tracks but they are still used. Approximatley 2-3 a.m. we heard groaning and splashing in the water nearby. this was later confirmed later that morning though. When I heard the noise I thought it was one of my friends. So I peaked my head out to see but it was too dark so I yelled to \"shutup\" and the being ran away. Once again I thought it was my friends just playin around so I wasn''t concerned and I didn''t investigate.<BR> When the sun rose we started packing up and notice huge footprints in the sand that led into the trees coming from the water. The stides were enormous, we could fit one of my shorter friends who is 5''4\" between the prints easily. The size of the foot was very large about a size 19 or 20.

Theres a steam that runs by Shipey''s Choice and Ben Oaks across the road. At that time Shipey''s Choice was a new sub-division where homes were being built. The steam was at the bottom below two hills. I recall playing around the steam and following it back to Ben Oaks. I was alone and remember feeling like I was being watched. I looked up the hill in the area of the new sub-division about 250 ft. away and saw a bigfoot maybe 7-8 ft. tall. I didn''t know what it was at first. It was dark brown and big.

    " First of all this is the first time I have ever come forward in writing about this incident(s) that took place approximately 18-19 years ago.<BR><BR>Myself, my Uncle and a few hunting buddies frequented a 68 acre parcel of land in Street, MD.  One day we were conducting target practice (sighting in our guns) for the upcoming hunting season.  It was a warm, sunny day and off in the distance one of us noticed movement in a wooded area across Broad Creek.  It appeared that there was a large dark silhouette walking back and forth in the foliage.  Every time it walked back and forth it would stop and grab a hold of a large tree and began to shake it.  Keep in mind this was a calm warm day and no other trees were moving because there was no wind.  I thought it was very unusual behavior and must have taken an enormous amount of strength to be able to shake a tree of this size.  I peered through my 4 X rifle scope to examine the object more closely and observed it to walk upright and was covered with dark brownish hair.  Its head was large and I could only observe the upper half of the body.  When it turned, its arms appeared to be long and muscular and I could see that its back was very muscular too and had a \"V\" shape to it, which led me to believe that this was no bear.  It seemed to be agitated that we were there.  After about 15-20 minutes of watching it we decided to leave and never spoke of the incident again.<BR><BR>Additional things: In October just after dusk that same year on the same parcel of property my uncle was walking from the the dirt road area through a grassy area down a hill to the barn.  I heard him yell and call out to me.  I came running thinking he had fell down and I observed him on the ground with his tools scattered all over the ground.  I smelled a horrible pungent odor, heard heavy breathing and large foot steps coming from the near by wooded area.  It was dark and I could not see anything and I got an eerie feeling of being watched.  I got my uncle up off the ground and he told me as he was walking down the grassy trail, he heard long loud foot steps coming up from behind him.  <BR><BR>Thinking it was one of us playing a prank on him, he braced himself for one of us to jump on his back, however whatever hit him from behind knocked him with such force, he feel forward to the ground causing him to drop his tool box.  He said whatever hit him ran into the woods and was grunting and walking back and forth.  We both got flash lights and tried to look in the wooded area where we heard the heavy breathing but did not see anything but heard what sounded like bipedal footsteps go down the large decline and cross the creek at the bottom.<BR><BR>I am a trained observer and can only tell you what I saw.",

But on the way going back down the driveway, my folks stopped because one dropped something in the car. while our car was temporarily not moving, I curiously looked out the window and over toward the hillside, and i could make out the shadow and the eyes.<BR>I was 8 at the time, but I was rather intelligent for a kid- I knew what a deer looked like, what a fox looked like. <BR>Since that time in 1993, Ive heard sounds and reports of similar activity.

    " I came across your website, and decided to look for reports in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. After reading the posted reports, I thought I''d share the following:<BR><BR>I resided in the Annapolis area for approximately 8 years, from 1969-1977, and lived in numerous areas in and around the city.<BR><BR>In 1972-73, I was living in the Saferan (sp?) area, outside of Epping Forest, on the outskirts of Annapolis. This area was a wooded peninsula extending into the Severn River. <BR><BR>During the summer of ''72 or ''73, I was 10-11 years old. One evening I awoke because of the summer heat. My bed lay roughly 2 feet from and parallel to the bedroom window. The bedroom window was on the ground floor level and faced a roadway lit by a single street light in this area. I recall having just awoke and sat upright in bed, looking to my left at the floor fan. I recall thinking that the evening was very, very hot. As I sat in my bed waking up, I turned to my right, looking directly into the window. What I saw can only be described as a large head, with distinct hair covering it; it was much, much larger than any human head. I recall seeing the thing''s eyes blinking at me, from a distance of 2-4 feet. I also recall seeing the teeth in it''s mouth. The eyes and the teeth contrasted sharply from the darkness of the rest of the head. The light from the roadway was behind and to the thing''s left, so I wasn''t able to make out any distinct features, other than the eyes and the teeth. There were no sounds other than the fan. This thing was making no threatening moves, in fact it was doing nothing other than looking into my bedroom window and seeing me looking at it. After maybe 10-15 seconds, during which time I went from trying to comprehend what I was seeing to being very, very frightened, I lay back down on my bed, rolled off the bed to my left and crawled out of my bedroom on my hands and knees to a bathroom. My mother found me sometime in the bathroom. When I relayed the story to her, she told me the curtains were closed and to go back to bed. I know the curtains weren''t closed, but, thanks mom.<BR><BR>For what it''s worth.",

    " It was in at the end of August 2003. My self and a friend were fishing the Potomac River. We Were fishing between mile marker 57 and 58 off the C&O Canel. We parked in the town of Knoxville Maryland and crossed the rail road tracks to get to the river. We were fishing in a brach of the Potomac that was about 600 meters long before it went back into the river. We got to the spot around 8:00 AM we had our backs to the Potomac when fishing the banks of the branch. Behind us was the Potomac. There was an island that was about 600 meters long and about 200 meters at it widest point. The island is a hill and you can''t see the Potomac from were we were fishing. We were only there about Five mintues when heard what sounded like a dying deer. My friend heard it too, I said it sounds like some one shot a deer and it was dying. This whole time we were walking down the river and fishing at the same time. As I got farther down the branch of the river my friend said what is that alful smell. I said it must be that deer. <BR><BR>My friend said that is the worst smell I have ever smelt before. Then we heard some thing moving behind us on the island. I was thinking that deer is not dead yet. I started to walk across the water (which was about three feet deep) to the other side to see it. As I was walking I could smell it and it was getting worst. My friend said what is it, I don;t know I can''t see any thing but I can smell it. He started walking over towards me. He was walking with the river (south east) I was standing in front of a hill and could not see over it. Wear he was walking from he could see over the hill. I was about 50 meters down river from him. He said John I see some thing, I said is it a deer. No I think it is a bear. I started to walk back and towards him. I was hoping it was not going to atttack us. I said lets go some place else. <BR><BR>I wanted to fish not get attacked by a bear. He was walking to me and I was walking towards him I said lets go. Then were heard it again and I said that dose not sound like a bear.He said No but it might be a bigfoot. I said all the more reasons to go some place else. As I got to the bank acrossed from the island I got up on land to see if I could see it. He was still in the water but walking towards the bank wear I was standing. I could not see any thing but I did hear some thing walking on the other side of the hill. I said maybe it was a hunter and he killed a deer and now he is coming over the hill back to his car draging the deer. The steps were getting louader and I could smell the smell with every breath. At this point I am ready to run. I was a 4:18 miler in college and I was hoping my feet don''t fail me now. <BR><BR>It stopped and we could not hear it any more. I would have ran like hell if I would have seen a bigfoot. That might have been the day I went sub 4:00 in the mile. We left and talked about all day long. We still talking about it. He likes to tell the story I don''t go up that way much.",

    " In 1981, I was on the South Branch of the Patapsco River, approx. 1 mile downstream from Rt.32.  This section of river flattens out into riffles then empties into a larger pool.  I have fished this part of the river since I moved to Maryland from Pennsylvania in 1976.<BR><BR>I was fishing on the north bank of the river and noticed a stray large mixed breed dog showing alot of interest on the south bank.  This area has about 100 ft open area before it becomes wooded.  The dog suddenly started to bark and jumped at something that stood up in the brush near the river.  This animal, the best terms I can describe, stood approx. 7-8 ft. and had the shape of a slouching human, full dark brown matted hair covering the body.  The creature was making a ticking sound....hard to describe. <BR> The dog lunged at it and quickly was slammed to the ground by the creature.  By this time, I was wading across the shallow area of the river and caught a scent of this animal....reminded me of a heavy musk smell...kind of like that of a fox.  The dog ran away and the creature started to walk into the woods.  I tried to walk behind it, but I was in waders and lost sight of the creature.  I did see the dog a bit later and it had blood on it''s mouth and backside. <BR> I drove to a phone in Sykesville and called the police.  I was told to return to the scene and wait.  It took me about 3 mins to get back....and a police cruiser (State Police) was already there.  I was immediately told to leave the area.  I returned an hour later and noticed several state vehicles and one federal vehicle as well as police...the area was taped off.  I could see people combing the area....I was told once again to leave. <BR> I tried for several days to get answers from state official but never got an answer. I called WJZ, WBAL and WMAR about the incidents and each seem very interested.  I contacted each station later and was told that they had \"no idea\" of an incident and did not want to talk to me.<BR><BR>That''s about it....I was very frustrated by this.  I have reported this incident to only a few sources over the years.  If you have any information...I would appreciate it...<BR><BR>Lon Strickler",

    " I believe it was May or early June of 1985.  I rented a cabin in the Catoctin State Park with a friend and we just spent one night.  The cabin was just a simple one room building with a window on either side and a cabinet to store your belongings.  There were two army style cots on either side of the cabin, each near a window.  It was very rustic.  The door didn''t even have a lock on it, it was just a wooden latch that went through a slot on the door frame.  <BR><BR>My friend and I hiked during the day and then went to some store and bought submarine sandwiches and a bottle of wine.  As night was fallng we sat out on the tiny porch, ate the sandwiches and split the bottle of wine.  It was a very pleasant evening.  We sat on the porch and talked for several hours, but by the time 10:00 PM rolled around, the combination of all of the hiking and the bottle of wine made us sleepy.  <BR><BR>My friend and I turned in for the night and we both fell asleep very soon.  My friend is a very heavy sleeper, but I''m a much lighter sleeper.  At some point during the night I was awakened by something.  I didn''t know what it was, just that my sleep had been disturbed.  I lay in bed and just listened, starting to fall back asleep when I heard this strange cry off in the distance.  I had no idea what it could be having never heard it before.  I would hear a series of three or four crys and then silence.  Then after about a minute or two it would start up again, only sounding closer each time it started anew.  It was a very weird sound.  <BR><BR>I just lay there and listened and I kept thinking that the only thing that I could match it up with was the cry of a gibbon that I had heard on TV.  But I thought, that certainly can''t be what it is.  I''m not exactly an expert, but I''m a big nature lover and I''m fairly familiar with the common animals of Maryland and I just had no idea what the sound was.  Well, it just kept getting louder and louder each time the next series of cries started.  It sounded like it was maybe a half a neighborhood block away when, even though it was a warm night, I shut the window near my bed because it was so creepy.  <BR><BR>I tried to gently awaken my friend on the other cot, but to no avail.  I remember that I had to go to the bathroom, but was to uneasy to go out.  There was no bathroom, just the woods.  I stayed awake for about another hour and since I didn''t hear the cries anymore, I went out on the porch and urinated as fast as I could and went back in and locked the door and eventually went back to sleep.  I told my friend about it the next day, we had a laugh and that was it.  I have thought about it on and off all these years.<BR><BR>What prompted me to report it is that I saw and then bought the Discovery film, \"Sasquatch, Legend Meets Science.\"  There is this segment of the film where this older male scientist and his young female assistant are analyzing these sounds reported to be Sasquatch vocalizations.  When I heard the crys that they were listening to, chills just went up my spine.  They are darn close to, if not exactly what I heard that night in the cabin in Catoctin State Park. <BR><BR>I have never heard anything like that in the woods before that night or since, except the first time that I watched that Discovery Special about the efforts of those scientists trying to use scientific disciplines to prove or disprove the existence of Sasquatch.

    " In the Summer of 1970, I was taking my pony and dog for a walk in the thickly wooded area where my parents had just built a new house. It was at that time a very isolated area.  We had apparently disturbed the wildlife in the area as we were always seeing very large black snakes and other wildlife near the house.  I was not prepared, however, for the creature I encountered in the woods behind our home.  I looked up on the thickly wooded hill and saw a huge creature that resembled a gorilla or a bear.  It was dark in color and appeared to be hairy.  It was on the other side of an old fence from me.  I was very frightened. I fled the area immediately.  I wish I could describe this creature better.  I really don''t think it was a bear.  Bears are not usually sighted in our area and this creature was really big and it startled me because of it''s size.  I don''t frighten easily and was accustomed to living in the country with wild animals.  The one thing that does amaze m e when I look back on this incident is that my dog and  pony had no reaction to this creature.  It makes me wonder if they had become accustomed to it coming around when we weren''t outside.  I never saw it again but a couple of years later my mother saw something from her kitchen window that looked to her somewhat like a bear but she wasn''t sure as she was not close enough to it to see features.  It was on all fours and it got into the nearby stream and walked around the bend and out of sight.  The area where we had these sightings was in Washington Co. MD.  We live near a stream and a thickly wooded area.  The stream feeds into the Conococheague Creek which then feeds into the Potomac River a few miles from our home.  My parents have lived there for 30 years now and there have been no sightings of any creatures such as the ones we observed in the early 1970''s.  However, we were the first to really disturb that woods and the area is now much more developed.",
    :environment
    "This area is a thickly wooded area. There is a stream that flows through the area and it feeds into the Conococheague Creek about two miles from where the sighting occurred. The area is very hilly but not mountainous even though there are mountains about 10 miles west of the area near Clear Spring, MD. One strange thing about this area is that it is where a line runs that divides the limestone ground from shale ground and it is right on our property and just a maybe 150 feet from the sighting. The shale ground was covered with cedar trees while the limestone ground is covered by Oak and Sycamores for the most part. The area is near Cedar Ridge Road and along that road there are lots of huge limestones that are visible in the fields and many big sinkholes. There have been stories that these sinkholes are above caves that run from the Potomac River back under this area. The Potomac River is close to the area and the Conococheague Creek feeds into the Potoma c at Williamsport, MD which is about 4 miles from the sighting.",

    " This was at Davison US Army Airfield, Ft Belvoir Virginia. This was a while back so please hang in there with me.<BR><BR>From late 1977 to Dec 1979 I was assigned to Davison as a Military Policeman. The airfield is not that large and I am pretty sure it''s still an active military installation even now. The airfield is pretty much surrounded by a wooded area and part of the airfield is on a small swamp. When I started working there I was chided by other MP''s to be careful of the so called \"DUSAA Swamp Monster\" it was called. <BR><BR>We had to have a walking 2 man patrol a couple times a night walk the perimeter fence inside the field area. There were countless times while on those walking patrols that I occasionally made, where sounds were heard not only from the swamp area but also the wooded area along the south perimeter fence. By sounds I mean you could hear branches breaking, not small branches mind you, but I mean a VERY LOUD audible CRACK, you''d hear dogs barking in the distance and occasionally some kind of animal - which after hearing recordings on the net of a Squatch - they sounded AWFUL familiar! <BR><BR>Randomly I also had to pull guard at the main gate which is right there on Route 1 - the main entrance to the airfield. I''ve had the crap scared out of me more than I like to think about at that gate at night - you''re there all by yourself in a small wooden gate shack with 1 street light right above you and that''s it. Anyway, to the south in the woods I''ve heard bangs (what you all call knocks) and animal noises, I''ve seen deer running like all hell and jump the fence on to the air field in the middle of the night getting away from something and only 1 time, and it was 1 time way too many, when I saw a deer following the fence at about 2 AM one night and I heard something in the woods, I yelled out and I saw the red reflection of 2 eyes staring at me back from the blackness just inside the trees just out of range of the street light - I still see those eyes when I think about it and it''s been what... 34 years!!!  <BR><BR>One night, about 10pm, or there about, I had a civilian motorist come to the gate off highway 1 and ask me to call the State Police, I asked why and he said this big BIG hairy thing... yup he said thing ... walked across the road in front of him and headed onto Ft Belvoir property and he almost hit it. He thought at first it was a man in a gorilla suit but it was way too tall to be a man. This guy was shaking like hell too. I told him that it''s probably gone by now and the [troopers] probably would not find it. I had heard of other reports by motorists and even the State Police about sightings along Route 1 between DUSAA and Ft Belvoir.  This happened year round, almost any month of the year.",

    " October 16, 2012, between 2 and 3 am.  My wife and I were on our Honeymoon in Linden, VA. We rented a cabin for the week. During the night, I woke up to a sound similar to what I thought was our dog dragging a suitcase across the hardwood floor.  But she was in fact, in bed with us, on point looking out the bedroom window. The draggin sounds were long footsteps coming from outside. We listened to them for about 20 seconds or so as they were getting closer.  A silhouette then quickly, but smoothly, passed right by the window.  We quietly listened until we could not hear anymore footsteps, and then talked about what it may have been for a little while until we decided to just go back to sleep (our dog ALWAYS growls and barks at people, but she didnt, so we figured it was just an animal, or a tree limb swinging past the window).  October 17th, 2012, 1pm.  We decided to take a walk on the Appalachain Trail being it runs just a couple hundred yards from the cabin.  About 35 minutes into the walk, we both heard the most bone chilling growl.  It was so low in tone that we actually felt it in our joints and ribcage.  it lasted a few seconds before we high tailed it out of there.  There was no way after hearing that, that I was going to stick around, unarmed, with my family.  The growl wasnt loud at all, it was just bone rattling deep.  Listened to hundreds of soundbytes of animals to compare to, but nothing came even halfway close to what this was.  Ive personally heard wild cats, dogs, and bear through years of hunting, but this was something almost out of this world sounding.  Note that nothing was seen on the trail that day, but dont blame me for getting outta there ASAP.  All I could think about was getting back to the cabin with my wife safely. ",

    " In college, my social club would go camping twice a year for a bonding event w/ our new members.  We would go in Late November after the Thanksgiving Holiday and in Early April.  <BR><BR>A group of about 40-50 of us would set up a campsite w/ a large bonfire and we would spend most of the night in the woods just doing \"guy\" things like drinking and telling stories.  Invariably we''d get louder as the night went on, but it was a very remote area, not suitable for camping or any type of excursion.  We camped at the bottom of a large, steep descent that was a very dangerous rocky climb down.<BR><BR>Once we left the cars, even in full moonlight, the trees would be so thick it was pitch black and nearly impossible to see our way down so we were equipped w/ flashlights at all times.<BR><BR>All three incidents occurred in the same area, in the fall of 1994 and Spring and Fall of 1995.  The most unnerving occurred in the Fall of 1995 and caused most of our members to go home early because most feared we''d be shot at by hunters.<BR><BR>We observed, audibly, not visually, rock throwing and very strange howling noises that got closer and closer until we quieted down, then the noises seemed to abate somewhat.  <BR><BR>On the night in the fall of 1995, we camped next to a small stream that ran down the mountain and could hear rocks being tossed into it downstream.  We all assumed it was some of our guys since usually someone would wander off in hopes of scaring us.  This night though, it kept occurring so we sent out some of our guys to make sure we had accounted for everyone, and we had.  We had to keep a head count because we took as few cars as possible and didn''t want to leave anyone stranded.  Once we were all accounted for the noises got louder and closer and it was unmistakably the large rocks that dominated the hillside being tossed into each other and into the stream.<BR><BR>We all fell silent and the few hunters in the group told us it might be a buck just wandering the stream but then we heard a loud continuous wailing sound that no one could identify for certain.  We all, despite our intoxication and testosterone levels, got very very quiet and tried communicating back in hopes it was a hunter who was just lost.  As we called out into the night, more rocks were thrown and more odd noises occurred.  There were long wails, or howls and the occasional grunt, similar to what a large Ape sounds like when agitated.  Whatever or whoever it was, was agitated and was definitely attempting to frighten us.  After some time had passed, most of our guys decided they wanted no part of what we thought was a few hunters out to scare us, so most left.<BR><BR>About 10-15 of us remained through dawn, knowing that running wildly in the dark would be more dangerous than fending off some drunk.  We remained far, far quieter and heard more rocks being tossed in our direction, along with a few grunts but only intermittently and they seemed to grow more distant as the night wore on.  <BR><BR>On the previous two trips, I didn''t stay the entire night but on each one, we heard the same odd cries and rocks being tossed nearby at other rocks and trees.  We ALWAYS chalked it up to hunters trying to scare the college kids away but no one EVER replied and the screams and cries we heard were definitely NOT from a dog.  The fall of 95 trip was one that is most clear in my mind and the one that scared a big group of burly guys into heading home at around 2AM instead of staying the entire night as we usually did.  <BR><BR>It wasn''t until recently when my friend Randy told me about a BFRO expo in that region of VA that I even considered it being a bigfoot.  It had always been just a scary night in the black woods of West Virginia, but once he sent me a howl captured by a BFRO researcher, I had chills up and down my spine when I heard it.<BR><BR>Let me add that I am the worlds'' biggest skeptic and have routinely dismissed all Bigfoot talk as fantasy.  I don''t know what it was out there, but after reading about the rock throwing, the grunts and growls, the expo in VA/WVa and hearing that chilling howl sound byte, my brain tells me it had all the earmarks of a Bigfoot sighting.  It was eerie recounting it for Randy because each tell-tale question he asked me, I apparently answered in such a way that he was sure it was a Bigfoot sighting.  I am in no way convinced, but the circumstantial evidence is overwhelming.  ",

    " I''m an experienced outdoorsman, for what has been most all of my life. I was always 100% confident while in the woods, even at night. <BR><BR>It was mid August of 1985, myself and a good friend went camping in the George Washington National Forest. One of the most heavily forested areas around. At the time you would be hard pressed to find more desolation in Virginia than what we had. We drove up a fire road well past the few houses in the hollow. We made camp in a fire break between the mountains, but close to the bottom of the west ridge. I knew this little spot from previous adventures in that area.<BR><BR>After making camp, we went back down in the valley for some fishing, shooting, and some time in town. We got back to camp around 9:30pm. It was pitch black out, no moon that night. We couldn''t see a thing without the car headlights on. We finished unloading the car, and got a fire going. We sat around the fire for an hour or so. We had dinner, just some canned goods. We started talking, having a couple of beers, and enjoying the wilderness. Close to 11:00pm I personally noticed the woods were strangely quiet when all sorts of creatures should be making their presence known by now. <BR><BR>During a break in our conversation I heard the first of many howls. I looked at my friend and gestured to be quiet and listen. Then he heard it too. He asked \"What the hell is that?\". I shrugged and whispered \"I don''t know. I''ve been romping around these woods my whole life and never that before\". We zeroed in on the location of the howls, and they were coming from the west ridge. I estimate they were between 300 and 500 yards away. As I sat silent listening we began hearing crashing through the woods above us along with heavy footsteps. At some point I looked at my friend, who was a city boy and said \"That''s no bear, no human, and it sure as hell aint no siren.\". I could tell it was big, and I mean BIG! It was most deep, long, and carrying howl anyone could imagine. No man, animal, or machine could ever emulate this!<BR><BR>After 30 - 40 minutes of listening to this god awful howling. We decided to investigate. My friend was a well trained active duty Marine and I''ve never seen him unnerved, but he''s looking to me for answers I just don''t have. We both armed ourselves. We didn''t use the flashlights, because giving away your location is the first mistake. My friend had the 12 gauge, and I had a high powered rifle. In any other circumstance we would have had zero fear because we had brought a lot of firepower with us. But we were both visibly scared.<BR><BR>As we moved from camp and onto the road the fire light faded and we were in complete darkness. We kept close as we walked north. We separated a little and get some space between us so we hear more clearly. I was about 20 feet ahead of him. Even though our eyes had adjusted, we still couldn''t see any part of each other. I couldn''t see him from 5 feet, so we used sound to reference our locations. By now we realized this thing was pacing us to our west side way up the hill. The howling would pause at moments, and we could still hear crashing through the brush, and the occasional howl. I suspect we went up the road about 150 yards or more.<BR><BR>I whispered something like- I think we''ve gone far enough. It''s pacing us, and getting closer. He said something to the effect of- No kidding it is! We concluded camp was the safest place to be for the night. We made our way back side by side this time, and making no attempt to conceal our location, because it no longer mattered. it knew our exact location. I could tell it was no more than 200 yards away at this point, and closing in. The sounds of footsteps and breaking branches were more clear, distinct, and closer by the minute. It wasn''t paralleling us anymore, it was coming down at us in a slow zig zagging manner. I think we both knew the guns were pointless this moment, it was so dark we only would''ve shot each other by accident. <BR><BR>When we got back to camp we clutched the guns tight as we sat by the fire and listened. We kept pouring more and more wood on the fire as a deterrent and source of light. The little flashlights we had were never meant for the situation we had on hand. As we sat the howling went on and on. Sporadic at times, but never-ending. I started thinking to myself this has to be a protest to our presence. Anyway, we decided to wrap it up and go to sleep. As we lay in our sleeping bags in the tent we could hear this thing go on and on, howling and walking through the forest until we finally fell asleep sometime after midnight, or maybe even 1:00am. I knew full well it was no bear! Bears don''t howl, and could easily walk up right up on you in total silence.<BR><BR>Fast forward to roughly 1996/7. I''m sitting on the sofa with my wife, and we''re watching TV. Some show comes on about mysteries, unexplained etc. They play the Ohio Bigfoot howling. I shot out of my seat, pointed at the TV and looked her in the eye and said \"That''s it! That''s EXACTLY what I heard that night!''. She said something like- Baby, \"you''re white as a ghost!\" Sit down. I remember the white as a ghost part very well. <BR><BR>I wouldn''t go back into the woods by myself again for over 10 years, and only in daylight. Still, it would be over 20 years before I could sleep in the woodlands again. I had to do it. I was the father of a Cub Scout, and couldn''t let down my son. Aside from that I''ll never sleep in the woods again. I was 18 at the time, today I''m 52, and I know I was being stalked. ",

Talk about being petrified, because I sure was!!  I have lived around farm animals for most of my life and I know about what size this creature was, by just the sound.  It was bigger than a bear; besides bears can''t walk on thier rear-legs for that long.",

    "     I was camping at a spot called Big Slide just outside of Hyampom, California in Trinity County.<BR>There were at least five of us all sleeping on the beach of the South Fork of the Trinity river.<BR>    I woke up in the night, having heard something loud enough to make me sit up.  It was a bright moon that night and I could see across the river to the other bank quite clearly.  I saw a large creature on two legs shaking a tree.  It was a huge pine tree, I remember looking to the top of the tree and registering that it was a BIG tree to be shaking with such force.<BR>    I tried to wake the friend to my right, no one else awoke.  I had no doubt in my mind that I was seeing Bigfoot.  Everyone there knew Trinity Co. was a stomping ground for them.  <BR>    The river was running so I never heard any noise from it''s mouth.  It eventually stopped it''s tree shaking and ran down the beach in an arc and off into the woods.  I told myself that I would check it''s footprints out in the morning.  I went to sleep.<BR>     The next day I remembered it all like a dream coming back.  I took my biggest friend over to the other side of the river and we found the tracks in the sand.  We had him run into the sand from the forest and back out again, just as I had seen the Bigfoot do.  He was a 6'' man weighing at least 180 and his tracks shrank to about half the size of the prints that we had found in the sand.<BR>    We all agreed that it was odd.

    "    This incident occurred in the fall of the year, in Tulare county, Ca. The year was approximately 1955, plus or minus one year. I was about eleven years old, and on a boy scout camping trip. Although this happened to me a long time back, I now can remember it clearly. I say now because for along time I blocked it out of my mind. Sometime in the early morning hours I left the tent to visit the latrine, which was maybe fifty yards away at the edge of a small ravine. As I was standing there relieving myself I began to hear small limbs and heavy brush breaking just on the other side of the ravine. My first thought was that a steer or cow was over there, and I quickly directed my flashlight beam in the direction of the sounds. What I saw Froze me in terror. It looked to be about seven maybe eight feet tall, covered with long shaggy brown hair and kind of teetering back and forth on it''s two feet. The head was very large with no neck to be seen, and the eyes about ten to twelve inches apart,with round glowing orange appearance. The arms were very long, and hung straight down.<BR>I turned and ran back to the tent, wetting myself all the way. Everyone that I tried to relate this incident to just laughed at me, including my own family. Finally I just told myself that it didn''t really happen. Thats how I left it untill one day a few years ago I picked up \"The Bigfoot Case History Book\", and while paging through it, suddenly there was the picture of what I saw so many years ago. Not ape like at all, but what they referr to as the diving helmet type.",

A few of my neighbors say they have smelled them but not seen them. There is so much more and this thing is continuing.OTHER STORIES from Report # 20720: Yes, but I am not at liberty to discuss them because the woman who saw it was a Forestry employee.

    " My name is [TH], and I have lived in an old Mining Camp, in Northern California for the past two years. During that first fall I would hear a strange whistling call that would come from a Sequoia tree that stands out in about 2 acres of blackberries that surrounds my yard. The berries run down to a thermal spring on the property that itself runs down to I creek, which is around 50 ft. further up the hill from that creek.<BR><BR>I thought this was a stray bird of maybe a tropical sort perhaps lost by someone. It would call to me in a guttural clicking sound followed by a series of sing song chirping whistles. I would call back, and then it to me and so on and so forth for around 20 minutes to 45 minutes before it would stop. It was always at dusk towards night and so I would call it a \"night bird\".<BR><BR>There have also been numerous times that I smell a strong wet garbage smell that shows up suddenly in my yard and house. The latest incident is taking place around every few days now, at least for the last three and one half months. This smell shows up in the late spring and usually stays around off and on through the last apples falling from the fruit trees on my property. I rent.<BR><BR>I have sensed something looking at me from the steep hill across the road from my house that comprises my back yard. Sort of like the feeling one gets when a puma is near. <BR><BR>The other night I had an incident where the creature I am talking about banged on my trailer at around four in the morning. When I went outside on the porch to see if it was somebody, I had every single hair on my body go up instantly. I just knew that whatever it was; was right there. I beat feet into the house and locked the door. The early morning smell was so strong that I couldn''t even sleep. It smelled like a garbage dump. I have been around lions and have had the hairs on the back of my neck go up, but never anything remotely like this.<BR><BR>I have heard very heavy thumps coming down the hill behind my house late at night many times during these same seasons. They sound like very heavy footfall. There is one particularly loud thump that I can hear that I think I have identified as this thing as it jumps from the road next to my house down into the my yard on its way to the creek.<BR><BR>I have seen it twice now. The first time was around four in the morning when I walked out of my trailer onto my front porch. The door squeals so it makes a lot of noise and when I opened it I must have startled the thing.<BR><BR>At first I thought I had just seen the biggest bear of my life until it registered in my head that it was running on two long legs, crouched over. I noticed that it was swinging two very long arms. It was the fastest moving animal I have ever seen. [In 2005] I reported it to a place here called J.Bs deli and was put in touch with [Carmine (Tom) Biscardi -- a.k.a. \"the Great American Bigfoot Research Team\"]. They came and investigated and now I have a live video feed coming from two spots near the creek.<BR><BR>The second time I saw it was at around one- thirty in the morning a few weeks later. I noticed the apple tree in the far corner of my yard going berserk. The big branches were really shaking hard. I had a night vision scope so I took it outside and looked through it but the tree settled down and I did not see anything so I sat the scope down. When I looked back over there I saw a human form from mid upper arm up walking towards the creek at the edge of the berry bushes. The bushes are around six plus feet tall, and this thing was perhaps two feet taller. I saw large rounded head on very large rounded, thick shoulders. It seemed to have very little neck. I could see that it was hairy and got quite a good view because it was silhouetted by a light on my neighbors porch.<BR><BR>My daughter was staying in a tent out in the yard a few nights later and was awakened by some whistling and then by something hitting her tent. Like something had been thrown.<BR><BR>There has been a print found on my property also. It is around 19 inches long and about 8 inches wide. I have never seen anything like it, but it looks like a giant human footprint to me.<BR><BR>These incidences are ongoing. I think this thing summers here. What do you think? Also, do you have any suggestions on your experience as to how I may be able to study it or observe it here?<BR>I would be delighted at any input. <BR><BR>Excerpts from Report # 12910                                           October 27, 2005<BR>OBSERVED: I have new possible evidence on the hill behind my house that I and a few friends of mine have found, and we desperately want someone more qualified to look at what we have here. I would appreciate talking to someone ASAP so that I can connect with you for a possible story.<BR><BR>For two years I have heard a whistle and chuffing sounds coming from the berries bushes in my yard. I thought it was some lost big tropical bird. I would call back to it, and it would call back, and so forth. I have had some bad odor incidences including one that woke me up from a dead sleep and gagged me.<BR><BR>A volunteer found a footprint up the hill behind my house and some friends of mine, [T. C.] and [N. M.] found additional footprints and hand prints in an area up the hill from my house that appears to be some form of crude camp. I have been there three times now and the second time I went there I observed that some 4-5 inches around 4-5 ft. long branches have been brought from some where other than that location and laid in a sort of rectangle fashion around a depression in the earth. There are more of these depressions without branch borders in the area. <BR><BR>There are snapped trees at @ the 10 ft. level; there are \"huts\", for a lack of a better term made from big branches. Some look older and some look recently made. There are also snapped trees and tracks that seem to form a path from this site down the hill towards my house. [N. M.] Found two pretty fresh handprints that appear to be coming out from one of the \"huts\". The finger tips are spread much farther a part than a human could have done. We found three separate footprints there that did not seem to be very old, maybe a couple of weeks, but no more.<BR><BR>I saw the Bigfoot three times now, once at 4 AM in the morning, and twice at 1 AM in the morning. It was very dark each time except once it walked in front of a light and I got a good look at its height and silhouette.<BR><BR>Excerpters from Report # 20720:                                        August 09, 2007 <BR>It was four thirty in the morning as I opened the sliding glass door to my trailer looking east towards my yard and I Creek; I thought to myself, that''s the biggest bear that I have ever seen. As it stood up from the blackberries in my yard it was eating, I saw two long arms and two very long legs. It began to run north towards the path I have that goes thru the berries to the creek, and I said to myself'' \"that''s not a bear\". I knew I had just seen a Bigfoot. WOW!!!<BR><BR>I saw it run towards the creek and I heard it crashing through the bushes down there. I did not follow. I''m not usually a scared kind of person, but I did not follow because I was scared. I had never seen anything like that in my life. I live in the woods and I have seen lots of bears and large animals. I  consider myself good at estimating, so I estimated it as 10 to 12 ft. tall and it probably weighed somewhere in the neighborhood of 1200 lbs. no lie.<BR><BR>Later that day I went down and looked on the trail the way it had gone. I found horse hair ferns that had been torn out from an area of about a thirty foot radius where something had torn them out and made a large \"bed\", for lack of a better word, there on the ground near a natural spring that comes out from under a maple tree. I walked down to the creek and found the tops of two very large footprints in the sand at the very edge of the creek. The prints disintegrated into the water as I watched them, but I was pretty freaked out by then.  <BR>          <BR>On with the story...<BR>Every night for a whole summer I would smell it in my yard, it smelled like a mixture of wet dog, garbage and sewer...if you can imagine that.<BR><BR>One night the smell woke me up gagging. I thought it was a bag of garbage I had left out on the porch that night. You see, it is so much easier to stay in a sort of denial when you see these things. It really is too hard to believe what you are encountering. Anyway, the cameras were up in my yard at that point and I had these computers in my house so I sat down at the computer and started looking at my emails. <BR><BR>There is a window right next to my sliding glass door where my porch and stairs are. I heard a small sound behind me at that window while my back was turned away at the monitor and when I looked I saw a huge dark face in that window. The face was tilted slightly and I could make out the shiny spots at the brow and bridge of the nose. It was very dark outside and what I saw was the reflection of the things face in the light from the dining room. I looked at it and it looked back at me for a few seconds and then it turned away. A few seconds later I heard a loud bang as it slammed something into the end of the trailer. I looked later and found a big dent.<BR><BR>I got up and ran out onto the porch. I actually thought it was pranksters. I got out on the porch and noticed how dark it was in the yard at that point. I yelled, \"Get out of here!\" I thought that would scare away any kids that might be in my yard when suddenly every hair in my body stood on end. Have you ever been around a lion when the hairs on the back of you neck stand up, Yeah kind of like that, but about 50 times stronger?  I suddenly thought...man, this thing is right here in the yard with me. I promptly panicked...ran inside...and locked my door.<BR><BR>A few nights later I saw it walk across my property. There is a field light across my property in my neighbors yard and I saw it backlit as it walked down to the creek. I saw a tall figure...@12 ft. tall with large mounded shoulders and a sort of conical shaped head. I saw very long arms swinging as it walked. I could only see the top portion of this guy because it was walking by 8 ft. tall blackberry bushes.<BR><BR>I went up on the hill behind my house with a friend and we found a footprint up there. It freaked me out too because I wasnt expecting to find anything to tell you the truth. We made a cast and I would very much like to have that cast. I heard it is in litigation.<BR><BR>I have been up the hill above my house since then and I have found places with big holes in the ground where \"beds\" have been made. Some of them have crude frames in them made from 12 inch diameter snapped off branches that are crisscrossed to form frames. I thought that was strange. In those places there are numerous foot and handprints.<BR>",

    "There are two water features on this property that may be of interest.

It was perfectly still.  I almost felt it thought it was not visible to passing vehicles.<BR><BR>I went back to the area about 10 days later and saw some scuff marks on the bank side.

My wife and myself saw something rushing along the edge of the woods, Southbound, it glided into the woods as we passed. I said to my wife-\"did you see that deer?\" She said-\"that was no deer!!!\" It was a silvery-white, tall, vertical, slender thing with what she called \"flowing\" hair. Our \"sighting\" was about 3 seconds. This would have been utterly dimissed as something unexplainable, except we went back there the next morning, walked up to a cleared area with some very soft, muddy places. My wife got some poison ivy for her efforts. We found quite a few tracks, TWO DISTINCT sizes. Long stride on the larger. They were atleast 15\"long and about 8\"at the wide end. There were distinct toe markings on some. The shorter foot was about 9\" long with a more \"human\"look to the shape.

    " I had been working a swing shift at a paper press \"American Press\" from 3pm to 12 midnite, in the town of Mineral, VA (I think it was Mineral, in Louisa County.) <BR>About five of us were travelling home to Louisa, VA on not-too-isolated country road, when suddenly I saw something cross and go into the skinny forest at the side of the road. The first thing that struck me about it, was the way it moved. On a very primal level, I registered that it moved like nothing I had ever seen before; and my instinct on that primal level, was a gut-wrenching fear-reaction. Everything was happening very quickly, and the only light was from our headlights, but I noticed it was tall, and skinny, a dark figure with bad posture (a little hunched over.) Taller than any man I had ever seen, and I couldn''t figure out why a man would be at that particular spot, as there was not much around, and it was midnight.<BR>I turned around to one of the people in the van and saw she was staring at the same spot and I said \"Did you see that?\" She said \"Yes.\" She didn''t want to talk about it much, but I asked her what her first reaction was, and she said \"fear.\" When I asked her why, she said \"because of the way it moved, it looked like a killer.\" So then we talked about how something \"different\" would cause our first reaction to be fear, but the reaction soon after was of joy and wonder that we (older women, been there/done that) had truly seen something we had never seen before. It made us both smile, and I looked Bigfoot up on the internet the next day, as I had heard about sightings all across the US, but had never heard of them being around populated areas in the Virginia area.",

    " My two boys, ex-husband, and I were heading back to our hotel from dinner in Williamsburg, on the evening of October 22, 2020.  I took a left turn onto E Rochambeau Dr., which parallels interstate 64.  It was a clear night, dark and around 8:55pm.  I know that it was after 8:50 pm and before 9:00pm, because I was hoping to get back to watch the 9 pm debate.  <BR><BR>My son made a comment about my speed, and I pointed out a 55 mph speed limit sign, as we passed it.  I rounded a corner and saw a brief small glitter, which lead my eye to see movement.  I quickly could tell that it was an upright, bi-pedal figure.  As it walked quickly from right to left, I immediately could see that it walked like a human, but it was extremely broad and huge.  The arms and upper thighs were so big that I could see the outline of muscles.  The figure was blacker than black, almost looking like an enormous shadow figure, but solid.  My lights only revealed blackness, no clothes, just one solid figure.  I could see from the middle of the face and most of the legs.  I saw no features, as it was walking, only showing it''s side to me.  It moved smoothly and quickly.  I could not see it''s feet, or the top of the head.  <BR><BR>It happened so quickly that I didn''t have time to say look, to my family who was with me.  As soon as it stepped of the side, I immediately said, \"What was that?!\".  I was curious to where it went, and as I passed the area, I could see that it went into the woods. There were no cars, people or anyone else on the road.  There was one house a little further down the road that had a front porch light on.  I keep trying to understand the distance from my car to the area it walked in the woods, trying to understand the height.  What I saw was huge, no way could any human be as huge, tall, and broad as this.  Again it was black, so black, and my lights didn''t reveal details which is odd.  My children were completely freaked out, so I did not stop.  I''ve returned twice to the area to look at the road and surroundings.     ",

    " My wife and I were walking down the Great Dismal Trail which is the old Route 17 before they made a 4 lane version between Chesapeake VA and the North Carolina border. We had walked approximately 1 mile down the road and were sitting at one of the benches they put along the way. It was quiet and cool out, around 50 degrees. We started hearing what sounded like someone walking parallel to the canal on the other side. We heard the typical crunching sounds of leaves and twigs snapping. These sounded like the footsteps of a man (as in 2 legged). They started to our right as we faced the canal and in the span of about 5 minutes ended up being in front of us. Once the were near our center, we started hearing steps coming from the left side. We continued to listen as they seemed to be intercepting each other. A couple minutes later we heard what sounded like chattering or popping sounds from the center point and then the same sounds coming from our left. My wife and I were somewhat spooked at this point as we''ve never heard those sorts of sounds before. I was carrying a small, thick pine branch which I hit against a mile marker post a couple times to try to produce some sort of a response. About 10-15 seconds later we heard a similar sound come from the area of the footsteps but it seemed like it was deeper in the woods. The steps continued and it sounded like it was about to pop out on the other side of the canal. The canal is approximately 40-50 feet across and very deep at that point and the brush on the other side was essentially a wall as it''s so dense. We never did see anything but I decided it was time to leave. My wife was hesitant as she wanted to see what it was. We headed back to the gate of the trail and there was a park ranger sitting in his vehicle waiting to close the gates (the trail closes at sunset which is 5:00pm at this time of the year). There''s frequent blackbear sightings in this area so I asked the guy how bears typically sound in the wild. I told him about the chattering and asked if they could do that but he didn''t think they produced that sort of sound. We talked a bit longer and started towards the car. About 20 feet from the car my wife and I heard a loud but short scream coming from the direction of the swamp. The best we can describe it is a cross between a woop and a woman''s scream. My wife thought it was my cars alarm sounding but I said it doesn''t make that sound when unlocking the door. I have absolutely no idea what we heard but it was completely unlike anything she or I had heard before.",

    "We were on an old 2 lane road sitting on a bench between the road and the canal. The side which the sounds came from was very dense (to the point of not being able to see anything). It was large trees and lots of scrub brush. I have no idea what it looks like beyond the wall of brush on the other side of the canal. I do know the trees go back as far as the eye can see.",

    " After finally getting my twelve campers to sleep I left them with my co-counselor and took the short walk to the showers.  The time was 11:00 pm and everyone was asleep or at least in their cabins.  It took me 3 minutes to walk to the showers and on the way I didn''t notice anything unusual.  After my shower I stepped outside at approximately 11:25 to walk around to the other side of the building.  At this point I recall the sounds of the forest being stilled or a little subdued.  I also noticed that there were no sounds of the junior staff coming from the bunk house or pool as was usual that time of night, but it didn''t make much of an impression on me as I entered the other side of the building and grabbed my laundry basket.<BR><BR>  Coming back outside and rounding the building I heard something that stopped me in my tracks.  It seemed to be coming from a wooded area west of the bunk house and my initial thought was that it was junior staff playing around, laughing, and yelling.  But the sound seemed to be coming from one individual and was carrying very far.  It was a really loud howling changing into a type of whining bark and then ending almost like a hoot.  It was a sound that puzzled me because I am knowledgable in the sounds of wildlife and had never heard anything like it.  I also knew somehow that it was impossible for a human to make that sound, yet it sounded eerily human.  <BR><BR>Since I only heard it once I sucked it up and started walking out of the circle of light streaming from the shower building and towards the girl''s cabins.  Of course my cabin was the last one on the end and of course most people had forgot to turn on their porch lights.  None of this bothered me though until I heard the noise again.  It was a little closer and louder and it frightened me that it wasn''t just a one time thing as it immediately \"called\" again after the second time.  I wasn''t afraid I was going to get attacked or anything but it would be nice to be indoors so I started walking faster.<BR><BR>  The sound was repeating itself again and it sounded as if whatever was making it was getting still closer and paralleling my path.  I finally decided to break into a run and quickly reached my cabin, entering it.  The time that had elapsed from when I first heard the \"call\" til when I entered my cabin was probably a minute and a half since I ran some of the way back to my cabin.  I also didn''t hear anything else after I got inside but that may be due to the fact that I put on my discman to calm my nerves.  Also, the number of \"calls\" I heard in the elapsed time were about seven, some flowing into each other near the end.<BR><BR>  The next day I told the camp director and a few other counselors what had happened but they brushed it off as being a turkey or a dog and even though I didn''t know what it was, I knew it wasn''t one of these two.  Being a prankster and practical hoaxster wasn''t on my side because many thought I was joking.  When I wouldn''t relent with my story I was poked fun at and so I think anyone else that may have heard anything may have been discouraged from saying anything.<BR><BR>  I didn''t make this report sooner because I didn''t discover the website until a few months ago and I have been searching the internet for sound clips of wild animals to maybe rule out or make a possible connection with what I heard.  Everything I listened to was worlds away from what I heard, except for sound clips of supposed Sasquatch that were available on this site and some others.     ",

    " During early fall of 1981 when I was in 9th grade, several of my friends and I were playing war in the woods of the Petersburg National Battlefield.  We rode our bikes to one of the wooded fortifications next to a stream.  That was our base where we parked our bikes.  We would form teams and on this day throw pebbles for a kill when you found someone. So one team would wait three minutes while the other team hid.  During one of our breaks I was busting some softball sized rocks against each other in the stream to see the crystals inside.  After we were done, near sunset, we started riding back to the base housing and I remembered the rocks and decided I wanted to go back and get some of the chips.  So two of my friends and I doubled back and coasted downhill and then up the embankment.  We stopped at the top and upon looking down at the stream saw what looked like a black bear in the stream where I had left the rocks.  When it stood up on two legs, turned around and looked at us we all started screaming because it was not at bear at all.  Though we were 40 feet apart we did not see a face, but the smell was like road kill.  It then ran on two feet without making any sound that I could hear north along the stream faster than we could have rode our bikes.  We rode back toward the base and gathered older kids playing basketball and went back searching armed with sticks, rocks, and mop poles.  No tracks or other signs beyond a few more turned over rocks in the stream were found.  We decided it was either a Bigfoot or some advanced all over hair ghillie battle suit with six million dollar man powered legs.",

    " While on a training exercise in Ft. Pickett, VA., I was positioned in an observation point overlooking a camp. I was lying low in our hide providing over watch while my team member attempted to move in to within approximately 75 yards of this camp. It was at this point when three distinct knocking sounds spread no more than 1 second apart, were heard from our 6 oclock position. The distance appeared to be within 100 yards. After a very short pause of about three, maybe five seconds, there was the sound of a large branch or small tree breaking in half. The noise was so loud that everyone in the camp grabbed their flashlights and searched the tree line towards the direction of the sound. We were almost compromised by this noise, but as quickly as the sounds were heard, the forest fell silent. Unfortunately, no one was able to further investigate those sounds due to our focus being the exercise and not the wild life. <BR><BR>Approximately two, maybe three hours later, one of the cadre was listening to a range radio and overheard a conversation between an adjacent range and range control. The conversation spanned only a few minutes, but in summary it went like this: Range Control, this is range #... umm, there is a Bigfoot walking across the range! This range was only a few kilometers from our location.<BR><BR>Early the next morning, maybe 5am, one of the members of our team had to depart the training environment so he was given a coordinate to meet for ex-filtration. He arrived early and waited until the extraction team arrived. During his time alone, he commented that he heard loud foot steps behind him. He was not sure if it was a large deer coming to investigate or what, but he said it came very close to him. So close that he was hearing this animal breathing behind him only a little ways off. He said he felt uneasy and didnt dare turn around because his initial thought was that it might just be a buck that would become startled and attack him. A few moments later, the animal departed and shortly after he was extracted. He didnt want to think of this animal as anything but perhaps a deer. <BR><BR>After the exercise, we spoke with the role players about that night. They all heard the sound and thought one of us was trying to play a game with them or that one of us had fallen down the side of an embankment causing the loud noise. Once we advised them that it was not us, they just went silent and didnt speak of it any further. <BR><BR>The strange thing is that earlier that night I had this eerie feeling, like something was watching me from behind. My reaction at the time was to grasp my knife and prepare for whatever may come next. It never reached that point, but my senses were heightened and I found myself scanning my surroundings more often with my night vision. <BR><BR>Due to the nature of my work, I cannot go into great detail as to the exact month or day, but I can mention that it was in the early months leading up to spring. But I cannot deny that there is something other than normal wild life in the woods surrounding Ft. Pickett, VA. <BR><BR> <BR>",

    " It was about 2 a.m. on or about May 3rd 2011, I heard a noise as if something fell that was heavy, a thud sound in the back of my house. I thought it might be a bear or burglar. Me and my 21 year old son went out to investigate. I was armed with a pistol and my son had a shotgun. I saw a deer run as if it was being chased. Then I saw a huge figure coming out of the woods. This thing was at least 8 feet tall. I could not believe this! I screamed out to this thing to stop. It came towards us running. I told my son to shoot. He shot in its direction. It then ran to my left flank and continued to come toward us. We ran back towards the house. I was in terror because the thing was shaped like a man but was covered with hair. I do not believe in Bigfoot but I cannot explain this? I stopped and watched it walk away into the light and it was huge and there was an odor that really stunk in the air. It stayed in sight for about 5 minutes before it went into the woods. I investigated the next day and there are footprints that are about 18 to 20 inches in the field. Unless this is a hoax and someone was in a costume? We fired on this thing and it made a huffing noise and a shriek sound.<BR>I have followed some the prints and there is long hair brown and gray back in the woods. I have had more noise and sightings in the woods behind my home. I live in the country and unless someone is doing this in a costume then this is the real bigfoot. There is also an underground tunnel dug into the side of a creek bed. The prints lead into the tunnel and I am not going in there. It is not a bear because a bear would never charge a gun shot.  ",

    " I was in Junior high school for Crewe Junior High (no longer exists). I was riding on a school bus on a back road in Greensville Co. Virginia after competing in a junior high school basketball game with my teammates. We had lost the game so my coach had told everyone on the bus ride he wanted no talking on the ride home back to Nottoway Co. Well almost everyone on the bus was sleep or trying to go to sleep cause we could not talk. That is when I saw it. About 75 to 100 yards away from the road down a hill was a corn field with a scarecrow on a wooden cross in the middle of it. I saw out of the foggy window cause it was early winter a huge figure standing like a man with hair all over it. I could tell it had hair because it was thick and long from under it''s arms. It had to be about 8 to 9 foot tall because it''s head was at the chest area of the scarecrow on the wooden cross. It was huge and massive. It appeared to be looking at the scarecrow. As the bus drove by I sat up in the seat to try to get a better look out the window because I had the window cracked to get some air. I yelled at my coach and everyone on the bus \"did you see that?\". They all laughed and joked on me. I tried to get my coach to turn around to go back. He was so mad at the team for losing the game he told everyone to be quiet and not say another word or we would be running laps the next day. So I did not say anything else. What I saw that night has haunted me for a long time until today when I got a text message from my brother about an article he read from you guys about Big Foot sightings in Nottoway and Brunswick counties. My brother knows of the story I have told and wanted me to know that I was not the only one to have seen something like this in my hometown area.

    " My ex''s step father was born in Amelia County, Va, so my husband hunted a lot where his step father had family land there, I would sit in the car while he went hunting. It was getting dark [dusk] and I could hear children playing, but just over looked it. A few minutes later my husband scared me when he came up to the car from the rear, and eased the door open to put his shotgun in the back. He was uneasy about something, so I asked what was wrong. He told me to roll up the car windows, but leave a crack for air. He was scaring me, which he never did, he was scared of NOTHING. He pointed to a large tree in the field ahead of us. What I saw was the SAME animal you showed in the Dec 31, show [NY State]. It made the hair on my neck rise, and a chill go down my back, I still feel that fear even today. It looked like 2 of them, just crawling around a huge oak tree. One of them went behind the tree, then appeared at the base, and looked around the tree at us. Chills ran down my spine, and we started the car and we left. We were going to spend the night, but drove home to Lynchburg, VA that night. He never went back to that spot again, and it took him a long time to even go back there hunting.",

    " From the late 60''s to about 1990, my Dad took us camping many weekends in the summer to the John H Kerr Reservoir (hereafter know localy as Buggs Island Lake)wich stradles the Virginia, North Carolina border, along the southern border of Va and about half way across the state from the Atlantic Ocean to the Tennessee. This lake is very large, man made and 80 miles long, part of the Roanoke River and 3 miles wide at the Clarksville bridge. We had a 64 Ford Econoline conversion camper that we used to travel a great deal and camp in often. About 1970, my Dad found a farmer named Sam Buggs, that had turned a portion of his farm along a section of Buggs Island Lake into a permanent private campground with yearly leases on lots. Most People had campers or even large mobile home placed there in a semi-permanent arraingement. My Dad had sold the van and was about to buy a 23ft camper and was thinking of leasing a lot from Mr Buggs so we went to the lake with a couple of tents as I recall, around May of 1970. We had a typical family camp set up and had grilled burgers and such on the colman stove and then sat around the fire and talked and joked until we all went to bed in our tents, 3 kids in one, Mom and Dad in the other. I was 15 then and didn''t go right to sleep, but lay there a while and listened to the rest of the camp area quiet down and settle in for the night. The place within the camp that we pitched our tents that night wasn''t in a typical \"setup\" campground. We were more or less just in a spot cleared of small brush along side the tractor path that led down to the lake. The piece of lake that afronted the camp near us was just 25yds away. There weren''t any campsites within 50/75 yds of us, so it was really quiet by about midnight. I was laying there when I heard something rooting around in our trash. Now, let me tell you, I lived so far back in the country and camped and fished and hunted and just ran the woods all the time since our nearest neighbor was 3/4 mi away, that my Dad use to say we went camping to \"see\" people! Well, upon hearing the noises from the trash, I thought of the pet Racoon that I had just 2 years before and thought I would see how many were out there, so I grabbed my 6 Volt flashlightt to take a look. I very quietly (barefoot) sneaked out of the tent and looked over to where the trash was and pointed the light and then hit the on button. Well, what I saw was no Racoon, it was a furry creature, standing about 4 ft tall, standing upright (and I don''t mean on its''s hind legs), that jerked it''s head suddenly to it''s \"left\" towards me, about 20ft away. It had been looking over and into the trash bag we had hanging from a stub of a branch on a  sapling when I interrupted it with my light. As soon as it snapped its head to look at me, it let out a squeal/grunt and dashed away, where, I don''t know, because I had turned to run the other way towards my Dad''s tent, and I started yelling and shouting about a monster or creature or at least words to that effect, as well as urging my Dad to get his gun (former Marine and Sargent of Detectives in Roanoke Va). Well this generally woke everybody up and and probably a fair amount of the camsite too because I created quite a ruckus at midnight! Anyway, I must have had to tell my Dad that same story over and over 50 times, (That was the Detective in him) and I had him convinced that I''d sen something, but we had no idea what it was. Of course, we''d never heard of Bigfoot then, but a few years later, after many ribbings from my Dad, and brother and sister, we did talk about it one night and did speculate that just maybe that is what I saw that night. Now after numerous specials and much information about Bigfoot and Devil Ape and many other names, I am more convinced than ever that I did see a small one that very night. To be honest, when people ask me to tell them just what it did look like, I tell them it did resemble those Star Wars, creatures, the \"Ewoks\", except it was slim. The fur was a reddish/brown and reddish yellow(orange?) color, the face was more like a Chimp or Orangutan, (that was my thought that same night). I did look for tracks, but the whole area was trampled by everyone looking around that night, so I never saw anything that looked out of place.  Well, thats my story, it''s true, I was there and I''m a believer!  The strange thing is that it wasn''t until years later that I realized that if there was a young one there, that meant there was an adult one there too! I''m glad i didn''t realize it that night, because I''m sure I never would have finally been able to sleep. My Dad did put that camper in that camground, about another 50 yards further up the slight hill, and they camped there until he sold it about 1990. I joined the Navy in 1974 and spent most of my time far from Virginia and only camped a few time there while on leave. I never did hear any other stories about strange things, but I did witness one other strange occurance, in the middle of the morning one day, just a couple years after Dad put the camper there. Sam Buggs used to have a very friendly Bird dog, the name escapes me, but one day, mid morning, in the summer, I did see that dog walking over towards a large oak tree, maybe 3 ft thick at the edge of the campground (this was maybe 50/60 yds frome my Dad''s camper) and his tail was tucked, and he was acting shy and submissive, yet walked over behind the tree as if going to someone he didn''t know ( I saw him do this often to new people in the camp ground). Just as his head and front quarter went behind the tree he suddenly flew trough the air as if kicked right back the way he had come, landed on his back yelping and ran as hard as he could back towards the farm. Well, I was pretty angy that some one would just kick that dog like that and went over to that tree to see who had done it, and there was no one around......anywhare. I looked around but didn''t see any sign that anyone had been there, no boot prints....nothing. The ground there had been raked down to just a few leaves and mainly a hard clay typr surface for a mobile home that was put right beside that oak tree the next week. Anyway, this was 2+2 doesn''t add up thing and that the only other thing I ever heard or saw myself. US highway 15 crosses a finger of the lake about 5 miles north of the Clarksville bridge, near a boat ramp called \"Stoney Point\", the campground was about 5 more miles up that same finger of water. I have no idea if that campground even exhists now. Im retired from the Navy and living in Arizona now. ",

    " The year was 1972. A group of us from Roanoke Virginia were on our annual after football season camping trip in the George Washington National Forest. We did this every fall as a treat after a tough season of high school football. <BR><BR>We were in the North Creek Campground about 10-15 miles North and east of Buchanon Va. An area called Arcadia, between The Blue Ridge Parkway, the Appalachian trail and Interstate 81. We had the luck of getting what we called the sportsman''s shelter, one of only two in the area provided on a first come first serve basis. <BR><BR>There were 7 of us, and it was a Saturday night. The shelter was a 3 sided shelter with a wooden floor and raised approx. 3 feet off the ground. In front of the open side is the area for a campfire. At about midnight, we had gone to bed around 11:30 or so, I was awakened by a strong stench and a presence in the shelter with us. <BR><BR>We were all in sleeping bags, side by side with our heads against the rear wall and facing the large fire we had going in front of the shelter. What I saw made me freeze, I could not move even though I wanted to. I wanted to wake the others but I couldnt speak. The animal was standing on its hind legs and because the fire was directly behind it, it was a silhouette of a tall, 7ft. hairy ape like figure. <BR><BR>I remember the hair covered it from head to toe, but could not make out any facial features because the light was behind it. After a short time I felt a liquid splash my cheek and it took a moment for me to realize that it was urinating between myself and the guy next to me. Actually, it was urinating on the guy''s sleeping bag next to mine. The smell was very strong, pungent. When finished it stepped off the shelter floor and disappeared. <BR><BR>It literally took me about 30 seconds to a minute to come out of what I can only describe as a paralysis. My friend Tim woke up about the same time yelling that someone had urinated on him, and he was truly upset. <BR><BR>He had thought it was one of the other guys pulling a prank. By now everyone was awake and it was obvious that no one else had done this. <BR><BR>When I explained what I had seen, we decided to move from the shelter which was isolated to a campground about a quarter mile away where there were more people. We were all pretty big guys, all football players, and pretty tough, but whatever happened that night scared us enough to break camp and move.  ",

It takes a while to get to the location of the camera. The terrain is very unforgiving. We had stopped in the holler and the camera was on top of the ridge. My husband walked up to the camera to where I couldn''t see or hear him anymore. I was sitting on the four wheeler in total silence. All of the sudden I heard this horn like yell.

    " My girlfriend and I were standing in a graveyard on a ridge top in Eagle Rock, VA. on Dec 24.  It was rainy overcast day at approximately 4:50 pm.   We were paying respect to my families graves when all of a sudden we heard a guttural call sound come from about, what I estimate, 100-150 yards away, if that far up the mountain from us. It was low and lasted several seconds. There were 3 distinct calls in the initial call. My girlfriend looked at me and said, \"what was that?\"  I started to answer her with an \"I am not sure\" response when it called out again, 3 distinct calls.  She said, \"is that Bigfoot\".   I said \"I am not sure, I grew up in the woods  and Had never heard anything guttural like that before and I have heard a lot\".  I could see the fear in her eyes.  I looked around and told her, I am not sure what it is but look at all the dogs, they know exactly what it is.  There was a very large dog about 100 yards away over the ridge, that was frozen in place and staring in the direction of the sound.  There were 2 other dogs, one on a chain on the porch of a house and a hunting dog on a chain about 75 yards away from us.  Both of those dogs were frozen in place looking in the direction of the sound.  Not one of the dogs barked.  The hunting dog was the closest to the sound and it was still and quiet. <BR><BR>My girlfriend said what do we do now?  Before those words were finished coming out of her mouth, I was trying to make the same sound back at whatever it was but I only did one guttural call instead of 3.  She said oh my God Ernie. It was quiet for 5 -10 seconds after my call and then it responded with another single call like I had just done. I thought I heard something moving. When it responded, a rooster crowed right behind us and then the rooster and chickens with it ran off the hillside behind us.  My girlfriend wanted to leave and go to my grandfathers and that sounded like a good Idea, however; I wanted to see if I could get close enough to see what it was. I convinced her we were safe in the car. So we got on the gravel road that went up to the water tank farther up the mountain, very close to where the sound had come from.  On the way up we  passed the dogs, They were standing still and looking up the mountain. When we got to the water tank I wanted to get out but my girlfriend asked me not to.  I listened to her and frankly happy that I did, since I didn''t have anything for protection.  I had the windows down hoping to hear it again.  There was silence and then the dogs started barking at us.   That told me whatever had scared them must have been gone then, so we left.  The hunting dog that was standing still when we went passed it on the way up the hill was spinning around and flipping he was going so fast to try to get at our car. <BR>I didn''t see anything but heard much.   <BR>",

    " I had gotten up in the middle of the night to get a drink. After leaving the kitchen, I went to the backdoor to look out the window. There is a road about 100 yards from the back of my house with a dusk to dawn light that is still in the same location today. As I stood there I noticed something start up the bank toward the road from our field. It cleared the road in one stride. I can not give any clear physical dimensions because of the distance and being night, but because of the dusk to dawn light I could tell that it was not a man, it had wide shoulders and long arms, and was hairy. I stood there frozen for a moment, and kept looking to see if it would return. After a few moments, I went back to bed. But this does not end here. The next day I went next door to my great grandmother`s house to check on her. During our conversation, she looked at me and said, \"I started to call you last night\". \"What for\" was my response. \"Someone was standing outside my window around 3:00 AM\". When she said this the hair stood up on my neck. Before I could say anything else, she looked me square in the eye and said, \"He was big. He was as tall as the top of my window\". You need to understand, my great grandmother`s home was built in the late 1800`s, and had the old, four foot tall windows. I stand 6`-3\", and the top of the window (inside the house) was over my head. Outside, from ground level, this person would had to have been close to eight foot tall! I then proceeded outdoors, where I found a large section of grass had been flattened outside her window. There was only one footprint, and it was in the direction it would have been walking to the road. The print was approximately 18\" long, and about 8\" wide. I never told my great grandmother what I saw the night before, and to my knowledge, she never mentioned this to anyone else. This incident is as clear today as it was 28 years ago. I never heard any stories from anyone else in the area. I have kept trying to play this off as a hoax, but it just doesn''t make sense. Why would someone go to all that trouble to hoax a sighting for the possibility of being seen by one 88 year old woman?",

    " My girlfriend had come to town for the weekend, and we had gone up to the abandoned fire tower on Butt Mountain to go hiking and camping for the weekend.  We arrived there early on a Saturday morning, and set up our tent and did some exploring around the campsite, since it was her first time there.  I had been to this site camping earlier in the Spring with some other friends.  When we got back to the campsite, we found that a group of students from Va. Tech had arrived and had set up their tents on the other side of the clearing from us.  <BR><BR>We spent the afternoon exploring below the cliffs to the west of our campsite.  There were some openings in the cliff face there, and we had noticed that they were full of trash dumped from the campground area above.  We had seen quite a few deer in the area, but no signs of anything bigger.<BR><BR>Around 5 or 6 we came back to our tent and started to make something for dinner. We had brought some italian sausages and where cooking those on our camp stove. While my girlfriend was cooking, I was watching the now drunk college students goofing off below the cliffs around the opening I had mentioned before.  As I was watching them, I noticed some movement in the trees across the gap.  I just caught a glimpse of something dark moving down the hill thru the trees.  Thinking it was a bear, I moved further behind the bush beside me, so I could watch it without being seen. It seemed to take forever moving down the hill. I would keep thinking it had gone off in another direction, then  would see a dark patch in the break in the trees. Finally it walked into a larger break in the trees, and was walking on two legs.  Thats when I realized I was seeing a Bigfoot.  <BR><BR>It had not noticed me thru the bush in front of me, its attention seemed to be on the noisy college students below me on the cliff, and it was blocked from their view by the trees and bushes.  The creature seemed to be a dark brown color, but it was in the shade of the trees, so I could not be 100% certain of its color.  It was covered with long hair.  I could see hair maybe 4 or 5 inches long hanging from its left arm clearly.  The face area looked dark, but less hairly, kind of like a thin beard in places.  I was probably 100 to 125 yards away, but I would guess the height was around 6 and half feet by the height of the bush beside it. Its body was wide at the shoulders like a football player with shoulder pads on. The body was muscular but tapered in size from down towards the waist and hips. <BR><BR> As the creature was watching the campers, it squatted down and was moving side to side, like it was peeking thru openings in the bushes and trees trying to follow the action of the campers.  Several times, it seemed to raise its head as if to sniff the air.  I watched the creature watching the campers for probably 3 to 4 minutes, then it must have realized I was there, and it turned to look towards me.  When it turned, I could see it had no neck, and had to turn its entire upper body towards me.  As soon as it saw me, it froze for maybe 5 to 10 seconds. At this point I could see the eyes were very dark and large looking. The nose looked more flattened than a human nose, but not exactly like an ape. The face seemed egg shaped, with strong looking jaws. I could not see much detail in the mouth or lip area. <BR><BR>After this, the creature moved behind some bushes and was blocked from my view, so I moved out from behind the tree I was at, and moved forward some.  I was hoping to get another glimpse of it, but only managed to see patches of something dark thru breaks in the trees as it headed back up the hill on the other side.  <BR><BR>About this time, my girlfriend came up behind me and asked where the bear went.  She had only caught a glimpse of something dark and figure I was just watching a bear. She wanted to know if it might come back that night and bother us.  Since I didn''t want to scare her, I didn''t tell her that it wasn''t a bear until the next day after we had packed the car and headed down the mountain. I didn''t hear anything around the campsite that night, except the students camping nearby, and they were up most of the night partying.<BR><BR><BR>I guess I should tell you. Until I moved from Va. 3 years ago, I had spent most of my free time in the woods, camping or hiking. I grew up exploring the wilderness on my own and also with the boy scouts.  I have a Masters in Biology, and am well aware of what bear and all the other native animals to this area look like. <BR>",

    " I put off sharing this story publicly for some time. When the incident occurred, I was working in Law Enforcement at a Regional Jail in Virginia. Stories of Bigfoot always intrigued me, and because I read quite a bit about them, my fellow officers got a kick out of asking me questions about Bigfoot habits. A couple of friends who worked with me decided we should do a \"Bigfoot Hunt\", aka, a weekend camping trip.<BR><BR>We told other people we were heading out to find Bigfoot in jest, we were all really going to just get away from everything for a couple of days. We all met up and traveled into Giles County, Virginia into the Jefferson National Forest. This was not a new place for a couple of the guys in our group who camped, fished and hunted in the area most of their lives. In all, about 10 of us, most of us Law Enforcement Officers, wound up camping that weekend.<BR><BR>The first night was on a Friday Night. It was clear skies and crisp air, but no moon. Some of the group decided right before the sun set to take a hike through the woods. To the best of my recollection, we were only a short distance from the West Virginia Border, so the trail actually went up into the mountains around us, we were in what would best be described as a kind of horseshoe valley with mountains and very densely wooded area surrounding us.<BR><BR>It took them a couple of hours to make it back to camp and we all sat around the campfire talking and telling stories until about 11:00pm or so, and some of the guys who had worked that day went to bed. We had our tents set up around the clearing of the camping space we had, most of the tents fairly close to the campfire area. A few of us sat up around the fire and continued talking.<BR><BR>Around 12:30am or so, while we were talking we heard what I would describe as a vocalization on a ridge that I would estimate was about a mile or so from us. We all stopped talking and looked at each other. Within a few seconds, there was a second vocalization from another area that was to our left and had to have been another creature answering the first one. There were no more sounds, but it did make us all take a moment and try to figure out what it was. <BR><BR>A couple more guys went to bed and that left me and another gentleman who had came with a co-worker, sitting at the campfire. While we were talking, I kept hearing these \"Click\" sounds behind us. I realized it was small stones or pebbles being thrown and hitting the picnic table that was about 10 feet away. We took out our flashlights and shined them into the trees but saw nothing. <BR><BR>There was just an eerie feeling of being watched from that point on. Even though we could see nothing, I couldn''t shake that feeling. I decided to sleep in my car that night instead of my tent. It was such a black night outside that without light, you couldn''t see your hand in front of your face. Very dark night. A creature could have walked around the camp and we would have never seen it outside the campfire light.<BR><BR>The next morning, I would say about 30 minutes before the sun came up. It was light outside, but not quite day yet, after a very sleepless night, a few guys had come out of their tents and we met at the picnic table. I was telling the guys what had happened the night before, there was 4 of us at the table and another guy was building the campfire back up, we heard what I can only describe as talking. <BR><BR>It was loud enough that all of us heard it, and it came from the dense woods behind where we were standing. It sounded like a language I had never heard before, like a mix of something that sounded Russian or Eastern European and an Asian language of some kind mixed. The sound was about 3 to 5 seconds long, like it was saying a sentence and then it was silent. We were all pretty much shocked into silence as we looked at each other then at the woods. Keep in mind, almost all of us were cops, and many of us were armed, but none of us was going into the woods to see what had spoke.<BR><BR>I stayed for the day, still wondering what we had encountered the night before and that morning. I didn''t stay the second night. Some of the guys who had not been up when the incidents occurred gave those of us who had experienced the events a hard time in jest, but I wasn''t staying out there again.<BR><BR>Could we have been pranked? Possibly, but if anyone knew who we were and what we did for a living, that would have been a dangerous thing to do at night. I also don''t know anyone who would have been that far out in the middle of nowhere that would have stayed out there all night long just to mess with us. That just doesn''t make sense.",

    " It was late July 2007 and my wife and I had brought our newborn baby daughter home just a few days earlier. It was about 1 AM and I was in the living room of my house watching television after pulling 2nd shift at work. My wife and baby daughter were two rooms away sleeping. She had opened the bedroom window earlier to let a little cool air in. All of a sudden a scream came from that corner of the house that stood me right up off the couch. I ran to the bedroom to find my wife sitting up in the bed as wide eyed and shocked as me. When I finally gathered myself enough and went outside to investigate, I found nothing. We kind of forgot about it until watching Finding Bigfoot several years later. They played what they thought were howls of the creature recorded on tape. My wife and I looked at each other and totally agree that whatever made the howls on the program is exactly what we heard that night. It''s a sound you never forget.",

    " Hi,<BR>    I am relaying this story for my brother since I have access to the net and he does not, but I will relate the story to you just as he told it to me with his permission. <BR><BR>My name is [PB], I am 35 years old and live in Salem, VA in Roanoke County. My brother [RB] who actually had the sighting on April 4 of this year is 8 years younger.  <BR><BR>I have several rental properties in this area and my brother is my repair person/handy man.  One particular rental property is vacant and it happens to be directly in front of the house that I live in now.  On Thursday April 4, 2002, my brother was painting the interior of this house.  I work 2nd shift and usually get home around 11:30 each night.  At 11:30 I noticed that my brother was still working on the house so I stopped to see how things were going.  He was visibly shaken so I asked him if anything was wrong.  He then told me that at aprox. 10:45pm that night, he took a break and went out to the front yard to smoke a cigarette.  He heard a dog barking back in the woods, about a 100 yards away.  A short time later my dog became extremely agitated, barking and growling.  He was startled because he had never known my dog to behave in this manner.  He then heard something large \"crashing\" through the trees, and what he saw, he just couldn''t beleive.  He said he saw a \"very large creature\" traveling at a high rate of speed and making a very loud \"gutteral grunting noise\" running much faster than a human could possibly run.  He said he got a very good look at it before it crossed the road and went out of sight. It''s arms were swinging down by it''s sides.  He said it was very broad and very tall but he could not tell me just how tall it was.  He said that it was very hairy, and described the hair as \"long and curly like a sheepdog\".  He said that it appeared to be a silver-gray color.  (All the reports of bigfoot sightings I have ever read however seem to say that they are brown or black in color).<BR> <BR>    My brother said that he would be glad to speak to anyone who might be interested in hearing his story first hand.  This is also not the first sighting in this area that I have heard about.  I also have a good friend who tells me that he saw a \"Bigfoot\" while out scouting for deer in Ironto VA. in Montgomery county.  Acording to my GPS, it is 9 miles from here as the crow flies.  <BR><BR>I can honestly say that I absolutely beleive my brother''s story and my friend''s as well.  Thank you very much for the great work and I look forward to hearing from you,<BR>Sincerely,<BR>[PB]<BR><BR>",

    " It was last year (2019) around mid October near the Blue Ridge Parkway. Me and my boyfriend were working for the Roanoke Times delivering newspapers when this encounter happened.  We delivered anywhere from 12am-6am. We were almost done with the route when we went to turn down this dead end maintenance road since there was houses at the end of that who got the paper.  It was around 3:30-4am. While My boyfriend was going down the gravel end maintenance road the headlights caught a glimpse of this thing standing right at where the grass met the road. It stood about 7ft tall and it took off up the hill. It kinda walked fast, not necessarily ran. It was dark brown and had shaggy hair like fur. It was on 2 feet and walked like a human with its arms swaying back in forth right below the knees. <BR><BR>I screamed out for my boyfriend to stop the car, but by time his reaction time kicked in whatever it was had already made it''s way up the hill. My boyfriend positioned the car so the lights would shine up that hill and that''s when we saw 2 bright glowing red/yellow eyes looking back at us. What was strange was it was hiding behind a huge tree and how high the eyes was up from the ground was close to 7ft tall. You could clearly see the eyes blink. We sat there for approximately 10 minutes and finally decided to finish up the route and come back. We did eventually come back after we got done with the last house and it was gone, but you could see where tree limbs and grass was pushed down from where it was standing on the side of the road.<BR><BR>Maybe less then a month before we had that encounter we had heard tree knocks while on our route, from deep down in the woods maybe a neighborhood or two over. It scared us so bad when we heard it that we just bagged the newspaper up and threw it on the side of the road.",

    " I was ridding my atv on the family farm going down an old washed out road which you cant drive fast on. As I started down the road looking down at the road then looking up down the road something caught my eye about 150 to 200 yards down this road. The sun was to my left shining across this road to the right as I looked down this narrow road there was a reflection of the light coming off the fur of something that I never had seen before,it was tall and massive. For that split second I saw it. The way the suns reflection came off of this thing it look almost silver. But being a hunter (I hunt this land all the time) There isnt anything silver in color. And that the sun coming off the back of a black turkey can look silver. So thats what caught my eye. This animal went back in to the woods back to the right. I worked my way down to where I thought I saw it. I turned my atv off and smoked a cig. Listing for any thing and about 5 min. had past and I heard something big running away from my direction breaking big tree limbs. (It was way louder than a deer running through the thickets). I could hear this for about 1 to 2 seconds and then it went quiet again. If I had to guess how far away it was I would say about 50 to 60 yards away from me when I first heard the running. (You cant see more than 20 yards in to this thickets from where I was at. (Hunting season end for general firearms 10 days before this so the deer are still alert.) Then it seemed like a couple of min. later I heard two big bangs like someone hitting a stick against a tree or log then the hair on the back of my neck stood up.Then there was the snorting of the deer that came from the thicket right after that. (When a deer snorts from my experience in the woods during the day they see you and snort once or twice and then they take off leaving you just to see there white tail waving at you as they go out of sight.) But there must have been 4 or 5 white tail in there all of them snorting and stomping the ground and they were real loud.The deer did this for about what seamed to be more than a min.then I heard them take off running. And thats when I decided it was time for me to leave too.I went home and told my wife about what had just happened and she couldnt believe it and was surprised at what I told her and ask if it was bear? I told her I never saw a beer in the woods and it seamed way to big to be a black bear.So the next day (Wednesday the 22nd) I wasnt going to GO BACK THAT DAY.I took a camera in where I heard this animal and took pictures of what I believe to be footprints and some hair that was left on a tree limb about 5 1/2 feet off the ground",

    " I am an avid runner. I run close to 50 miles a week every week. I often run the exact same route. When I trail run I have been followed by deer and other wildlife that comes up from time to time. However, today was different. First I was not on a trail but on a country road near my house. I crossed a main road and was headed out to my turn around point. There is a thick wooded area on the right hand of the road. I heard something in the woods and thought maybe it was a deer or a dog. I kept running but the noise kept happening. It was like someone was in the woods just out of sight running in the leaves as I was running on the road. I would slow down and it would slow down. I would speed up and it would speed up. When I passed a house the noise would stop for a few yards and then pick back up again in the wooded areas. I am an avid hunter. This really sounded like a person or something like a person running along in the woods as I ran the road. Thing is the wooded side of the road is very up and down with several deep drop offs. So whatever was keeping pace with me was able to navigate them with no problem at all. I run a 9 minute mile pace. So whatever was following me in the woods had to keep that pace yet in the woods and the deep valley areas. Maybe I was hearing things. However, there was a recent sighting in our area and I thought I would at least report this to you guys. No visual on what was there. I will keep a better eye out into the woods now if I hear it again though.",

    " At around 11pm on July 26th my wife and I we''re night fishing on the backwater of cranesnest river in Dickinson county Virginia. My wife''s head was hurting so she decided to take a nap we had heard something large walking in the woods but wrote it off as a bear or deer as both are plentiful in our area. She had been asleep for about an hour when I heard a large knock about 50 yards up in the tree line then about 15 to 20 seconds later several hundred yards up the ridge there was another knock. Both sounded as if someone had taken a 4x4 post and struck a tree with it. Then about 10 min later there was a splash in the water about 20 feet away from our boat. This splash sounded like something weighing 20 or 30 lbs had struck the water waking my wife. It''s not unusual to hear large fish jumping at night but this was different after the splash no more than a couple minutes had passed and there was 2 more knocks. And they were closer than the first one. <BR><BR>We pulled anchor reeled in our lines and as we were leaving we heard 2 more knocks. My wife said she heard the knocks up on the ridge but I didn''t hear those, just the sound of a large animal walking up the river same way we were traveling as if it was following us. When it came to a shallow cove where it would have had to swim we stopped hearing the walking sounds.<BR><BR>This is the second time we encountered this animal we had an experience about a month and a half earlier we heard a big animal walking around and had big splashes in the water as if it were throwing things at us on that night as well.<BR>",

    " My husband and I where sitting on the front porch one evening when what I thought was a bear caught my attention on the edge of the tree line. I told my husband to look at the bear and he stated that was not a bear because it was to large. We continued watching for approximately two minutes when a deer darted out from the tree line. The dark mass I thought was a bear then stood up and chased the deer into the woods. My husband and I looked at each other in disbelief at what we had just saw. It was too far away to get great detail of the animal but close enough to tell that it was very large and dark brown / black in color. After seeing it chase the deer on two legs back into the forest, I knew instantly that no bear could have ran so fast and so graceful on two legs.  The next evening my husband went to the same spot in the tree line while I stayed on the porch so we could compare the sizes between the animal and him. My husband is 5 foot 10 and what ever we saw was at least 1 and 1/2 - 2 feet taller than he was. ",

    " At approximately 10 pm one night, my wife and I returned home from a shopping trip. Upon opening the car door and stepping into the gravel driveway I heard a distinct and loud vocalization. It wasn''t a howl, not a growl, nothing I had heard before which is what caught my attention. At 31 years old now, 28 then, I had spent my life in the outdoors, locally and abroad.<BR><BR>I have never heard anything to match this. My wife asked me what it was and I had to admit I didn''t know, but perhaps it was a big cat. But it didn''t sound like a cat, and the only cats in the area that are known as ''big'' would be bobcats, a big one being 18-29 lbs.<BR><BR>I walked inside the house, cutting on the rear porch light, and walked through the house to the front deck where I walked back outside, cutting on the front deck light. I stood at the end of the deck facing east and listened intently.<BR><BR>The ''cries'' were coming from a ridge in a large woodlot across the railroad tracks behind our house. Our house is situated on 10 acres, and the rear property boundary is the railroad. At that time the nearest house to us, a couple of hundred yards to the east was uninhabited, but the next houses up and across the railroad tracks were. <BR><BR>Between cries, I realized I could hear leaves rustling loudly as though two feet were shuffling through them in large strides. When the leaves stopped making noise, an agitated cry was heard. This went on for a minute or two, then the noises came from closer to the neighboring houses, then it started going in the other direction. I probably listened for ten minutes total, until could no longer hear the leaves moving, and howls were coming from farther away.<BR>It was mid fall and cold, the sky was clear, no traffic on the road in front of my house which intersects with the railroad maybe a quarter mile down the road.  <BR><BR>I have labored under the impression that the cries came from some kind of cat, but after listening to the Ohio recording, the cries I heard were frightfully akin to the howls on that recording. They were shorter and sounded more agitated as though something was making the ''issuer'' of the cries mad. The large woodlot across the tracks is semi-surrounded by a loose assortment of houses in a neighborhood, which could be easily walked through unseen in the dark. Everything else for surrounding areas is farm pasture and mountain, in fact one mile from my house to the east starts a gravel road running across a mountain into the next county.<BR><BR>My inside dogs were whining and agitated, but never offered to bark, then, they rarely do. However neighborhood dogs could be heard barking in the distance, beagles I know for sure and a German Shepherd.<BR>",

    " Not certain of the exact date of this occurrence, but I was lying in bed awake about 3am and was startled by what sounded like something pushing up against and rattling the vinyl siding on our house. This woke Lisa my wife up. I went outside with a flashlight but didn''t see anything. We didn''t think much of this at the time. Then we had two other occurrences within a two week time span. On Friday, November 16, around 6:15pm my wife and myself were almost home from our daily walk and while at the intersection of Northridge and Old Saltworks Rd., approximately 200 yards from our house we both heard and were surprised by a very loud, deep, guttural sound that was something between a growl and a roar. It only lasted for a couple of seconds. It was very voluminous and powerful. We just stopped and asked each other what on earth did we just hear. Then the incident that was the icing on the cake that made us come to this website and file this report, occurred on Friday, November 23 around 9pm. I shined a light behind our house to see if there were any deer out feeding. About 160 yards from our deck in a small patch of woods behind our house I saw two, large, brilliant, emerald green eyes, which were the shape of human eyes, but were about 7-8 inches apart. This freaked me out. I am an experienced outdoors-man and have logged several hundred days afield over the past 35 years. I have walked for hours by flashlight to get to hunting stands and have never ever seen eyes this shape and of this brilliance and set this far apart before. Before these occurrences I was very skeptical of all the Bigfoot stories and sightings I have seen or read about, but now I am open to the possibility that there is something out there that could fit the description of a Bigfoot. What we heard was very unique, and combined with the eye shine I saw, has changed my mind and opened me up to the possibility of a Sasquatch type creature lurking in the shadows. This is very exciting! ",

This area is frequented by large amounts of hunters during the fall which should have made the deer stay very far away. We also had a large campfire.

    " A friend and I were in the woods just after night fall in the fall back in 1976. It was an old abandoned road the city never paved and it was grown over very badly. It had been used as a party spot for teens for many years. I was against being there but my friend wanted to pick up beer cans for the money. You remember back when everyone was doing that. Any way as we walked down I was shining the light from side to side looking for anything or anyone that might be down there with us. You see, for about two years straight , we had had run ins with this thing on several occasions. All our parents told us we were crazy, it was probably someone in a suit trying to scare us. We know the difference in a suit and a real creature. Well, as I shined the light to the left and came back across the road, this thing took one step to it`s left and was out in the middle of the trail. That was about 6 feet in one step. The s.o.b. was right in front of my light, about 10 feet away. I had never been that close to it before. I was absolutely terrified and yelled at my buddy and turned and started running my you know what off. It wasn`t really that tall, maybe between 6 and 7 feet. It just stood there for the couple seconds I looked at it. It never made a move towards us. Just stood there and looked.I actually only saw it for a couple seconds but it was about 4 feet wide at the shoulder and dark colored.

    " Since this happened 4 years ago you can tell I''ve been somewhat haunted by it. How I came to believe what I saw was Gigantopethicus or something very like it took time to develop and just tonight (June 26, 2007) after reading the news item about the expedition to the UP of Michigan, finding your site and then seeing Bill Munns model of Giganto on http://www.uiowa.edu/~bioanth/giganto.html<BR>I''m convinced I saw something out of the ordinary.<BR><BR>After driving in from our home in NY my daughter and I were staying in a cabin for a few days at the Staunton River State Park, VA with a friend of hers from VA. On the night in question I had to drive to Danville to pick up and bring back another daughter who was coming up from Greensboro to stay with us for the weekend. Her bus didn''t pull in to Danville until around 11PM so I left the park around 9PM. It was a dark, rainy drive with some patchy but not heavy fog.<BR><BR>Because of the conditions and my unfamiliarity with the road I concentrated more on driving than noticing much of the surroundings. At some point around 1/2 way I was coming around a wide bend to the left when my headlights fell upon a broadside view of what I first thought was a huge dog, just off the road moving from left to right. It simply turned it head to look at the lights and lumbered slowly but deliberately towards the treeline. It was then I realized it was no dog. Maybe a lion? It had huge eyes like a lion as well as a mane. But it wasn''t shaped like a lion, it was big in the front, big head, big shoulders and chest but more streamlined to the rear. Walking on all fours but not like a dog or big cat. The front legs seemed taller than the rear. If you remember the monster in the scifi movie ''Forbidden Planet'' you''ll have pretty good idea of it''s shape, not of course as exaggerated as that but similar. It did not appear startled or afraid, it simply walked in towards the trees while watching my car drive past.<BR><BR>Since then I had no idea what it could have been until I read something about Gigantopethicus and saw a pic of a statue of it on all fours on a website. That statue I thought was close but no cigar. Then tonight I found the Bill Munns picture with the model in color and it clicked. It was very much the same coloring, mane, head and eyes. The only difference was the size, what I saw was huge, on all fours maybe almost the size of a Volkswagen Beetle but if it stood up not quite so tall...but then again the sighting was only seconds before I had to return my attention to navigating the rest of the turn at maybe 40 miles per hour. <BR> ",

    " I live in Tazewell VA. Last Friday on June 20, 2014 me and my son was cutting hay on my dad''s farm in Thompson Valley near Route 16. It was close to 3pm and the sun was mostly out. I was cutting hay way ahead of my son, the field is half surrounded by woods and near the Clinch Mountains. I had made a pass by the corner of the field on a hill side and my mowing cutter is heavy so it slid down the hill while cutting, and left a strip of grass about 60 foot long before I seen it. So I raised the cutter and turned my head to back up and re-cut and out of the corner of my eye something caught my attention. I turned my head a little more and I saw something real dark or black and tall and slim with long legs running on an angle away and down the hill real fast . Now the beast was not on our side of the property and the slim patch of woods where I seen it was only about 4 ft. wide. The sun was bright so I saw it for the 3 to 5 seconds real fine! Below where it ran and beside one the upper ends of the property are thicker woods! At first it did not dawn on me what I just had seen because we were trying to get the hay cut before it got too late. But as I was going on and thought about why was a man there and ran off when I stopped the tractor to back up! Then it dawned on me it was to tall and it was blackish in color, and the 3 steps I plainly saw it make was the distance between 3 fence post. We put our fence post around 10 feet apart so that would make it about 25 to 30 feet in length in 3 STEPS! I then knew what I saw was human shape but too big for a human and if it was someone I would have saw colors for the pant and shirt, there was no colors just dark. I forgot to mention the bigfoot I saw was around 100 yards away so the first time I passed it not seeing it, and when I stopped to back up with the tractor It must have thought I saw it and that''s when it ran off I guess? I stopped to tell my 17 year-old son what I saw, he is 6ft 2 and slender. He crossed the fence where I saw it and stood there till I walked to the place I had seen it and I knew it was much taller than him! We found no hair or foot prints just cow and horse. And one horse hair. I am a christian man.  would not lie and tell this occurrence of my life if it was not so. That image is burnt in my mind till the day I die! I would have to say it was around 7 foot tall! And fast!",

    " On a hot summer evening between July-August 2006, I had the window of the bedroom open. I heard \"very close\" moaning or howling from our open bedroom window of our home around 3:45 in the morning. The howling and noise woke me from a sound sleep. I could not get my husband awake who was sound asleep at this time, I tried quietly. The howling or moaning at first sounded like that of another type of animal in pain (more like a large pig or cow at first) but changed to sound like something \"very large\" in size and getting very upset (VERY deep, angry tone growls). <BR><BR>I did some research before contacting you and I have heard what bear sound like on various recordings. As well as, other type of animal recordings. This animal in no way sounded like that of a bear or anything else I have heard in the past. Finding your web site and listening to the recordings of moaning and such brought chills up my back!!! They sound so familiar to that night but I still cannot be certain. We have a small spaniel mix dog that sleeps in our basement garage area located under our home. Upon hearing the howling outside that night, the dog moved to the garage door area located directly under the bedroom window and barked like being startled from sleep three times. I could tell, the creature I had heard moaning and howling moved to the garage door under our open bedroom window (which is two stories high) and growled \"very deep\" at our barking dog while \"striking or smacking\" above the garage door. The dog STOPPED barking! Then I heard nothing out of our dog or from the animal outside the window again that night. <BR><BR>I was too frightened to move and look outside. For a long time prior to this I had a strange unexplained feeling of \"being watched\" while being outside on our homes patio. This patio faces pretty dense wooded area on three angles back there. Something just made me feel uncomfortable even in daylight hours out there that I had not felt before since moving here. Although a bit odd, I no longer have this same feeling. <BR><BR>On two different nights prior, I couldn''t sleep and heard what sounded like small rocks hitting the brick outside of our home close to our bedroom area. I assumed it was just the home settling while the temperature was cooling down in the late evenings. We live in a pretty dark (not much light in this area at all) heavily wooded and somewhat quiet area just outside of town. We have several deer, turkey, rabbits, squirrel and other small game that roam throughout our woods and property.  ",

    " I live in a very rural area of McDowell Co. West Virginia. It is not unusual to see bear, coyote, deer, etc. on a weekly basis around my home. I am an avid hunter/outdoorsman, and I have seen and heard (up to this incident) everything the woods of West Virginia have to offer. <BR><BR>On July 23, 2009 I was setting on my front porch area of my residence (I had built a fire) at approx. 11:30p.m when I heard a loud \"scream\" from 150-200 yards away. My dogs immediately began barking in the direction of the noise. I assumed it was a mountain lion. I listened intently for a few more minutes but I heard nothing else. After about fifteen/twenty minutes, I heard something walking through the wood line directly across the road from my house. <BR><BR>The crashing brush led me to believe that it was a large animal, possibly a bear. At exactly 12:15 a.m (fifteen minutes after midnight) I heard a loud roar or moan come from across the road from my house, approximately 300 yards from my house. The animal then proceeded to moan again, however this time, I also heard a growl. After the second moan, I then heard what I can only describe as a series of moaning howls. <BR><BR>The howls sent a cold chill up my spine. I am avid hunter, and I know that the animal responsible for these noises had to be extremely large, at least 800-1000 lbs. I went inside and locked my doors. I am confident it was not a coyote, bear, mountain lion, cow, etc. This animal had a distinct, powerful moan that could never have been made by any of these animals.<BR>",

We had thought we saw someone else that was hunting coming our way from the direction we couldn''t be seen but the closer it got the more unusual it got. <BR><BR>It was walking about 50 yards below us and when we finally got a good look at it we could see it was a bigfoot. It was about 8-10 feet tall, fur from head to toe, and was extremely thick and muscular. We watched in amazement as it walked for about 100 yards until it was out of sight. <BR><BR>We told all our friends about it and got interest from them as well. We went back the next weekend with 6 of us in total at about the same time we saw it. We went to the same path it was travelling and kept hearing something in the distance on the same path ahead of us so we decided to try and track it in two separate groups. On the path we found 2 separate footprints that were human like but huge. We also kept hearing something ahead of us the entire time. We got to the top of the mountain ridge when the sun was starting to set and while we were talking all 6 of us saw the bigfoot heading down the other side of the ridge. <BR><BR>",

    " My wife and I were taking an evening drive on Highland Scenic Highway 150, from US 219 near Slatyfork, WV, to the Cranberry Glades area on Tuesday evening 9/6/16.  We had been stopping at the scenic overlooks taking pictures, and had just left the Williams River overlook, and headed south on 150.  There was a stretch of highway that was very straight and a downslope of about 4-6% about 1-2 miles south of the Williams River overlook.  As we were driving down, we both noticed something in the weeds between the road edge and the bank leading up to the woods on the west side.  At first I thought it was a deer, with its head and neck stretched up above the weeds.  It was about 300-400 feet ahead, and while we continued towards it, it spun around, similar to an about face, but with the head dropping and a semi-crouch as it was turning.  It jumped up onto the bank, reaching for a branch to aid in pulling itself up.  By the time it jumped, we were within 80-100 feet of it.  By the time we got to where it had been standing, it was nowhere in sight, and we could hear no sounds of running or branches breaking in the piney woods along the road.  We both noticed that the weeds at this point and all along the area, were even with the hood on the 3/4 ton Chevy pickup we were in, making the estimate on the height of the creature at about 7-7 1/2 ft tall.  The creature was a mix of brown, and brown gold fur, longer than deer hair, but not as long as collie fur.  I have never discounted that Sasquatch could be real, but this firsthand experience has removed my doubt.  As we left the area, my arms and neck were covered in goose-flesh, and we were both speechless for about 10 minutes.",

    "We have talked to many locals in the area. Most people keep to themselves in these parts. I can understand this.One lady we met did not know our story and we asked her if she had ever seen anything strange in the area. She said that she would walk her dogs around the same lake in the mornings after her husband went to work. Both dogs are large and not afraid of anyone. As they walked near the picnic area she noticed a figure at the edge of the woods. It was summertime and the figure was covered from head to toe in dark fur. She knew then that it was not human. Both of her dogs were terrified and would not bark, and they tried to hide behind her. She backed away and it disappeared into the woods. Since then she will not go back. Another incident was told to me by my parents, who were skeptical about my stories. They were camping last Fall and there was only one other man camping there. They jokingly asked him if he had seen any bigfoots lately? He got quiet for a moment and told them that a few nights before he had been camping outside the campground in a roadside spot. He had a small dog with him. Just before midnight he turned off his lantern and was going to bed. His dog had a certain bark for people he knew and one for strangers. The man told my dad that the dog almost ripped the blinds off of the camper and was barking frantically at something outside the camper. He knew something was wrong so he grabbed his pistol. When he went to the door, he saw a very large black shadow walk between the fire and the camper. This made his hair stand on end. He left the next day. I would love to go and spend more time in the area and show someone what I believe are hotspots. After the first sightings I have been convinced \"THEY DO EXIST!!!\"",

    "Yes... after this I have been very curious as to what this could be. I have spent a lot of time camping in all seasons including winter here. While free-diving I found numerous large tracks crossing shallow areas of the lake in water up to 8 feet deep. Most recently in the winter of 2005 my wife and I camped for 1 month in this area looking for clues. In late December we went back for a few days in the snow when there was no one else around, this time however I think it found us! All that night we heard loud knocking in several locations, one not far from our tent. It was almost as if they were signaling each other from across the lake. This was so loud I believe you could hear it for miles. My 3 dogs were extremely frightened and very quiet. Normally they would be barking.",

    " Many years ago while camping in Monongahela National Forest in the fall with my family, my son and I decided to walk around part of the lake at night time. It was a beautiful bright night. the temperature was in the 50''s. We came upon a marshy area just off of the trail. <BR><BR>There was a meadow at the edge of the lake. We heard a loud commotion, and sticks breaking. We stopped to look thinking that it may have been campers looking for firewood. I saw two very large black upright creatures ripping branches and bark from the trees. It appeared that they were eating the bark. <BR><BR>My son and I were about 125 feet away at the most. I was so scared and in disbelief, I quietly told my son (he was 10), to move slowly down to the ground. We crouched behind a rock and watched over 15 minutes. I have never sweat like this in my entire life, I was so frightened. <BR><BR>The smallest of the two had a arm reach about 10 to 12 feet. The larger of the two was several feet higher. All of a sudden, the two stepped back into the darkness of the woods and a third one stepped out. This one was unbelievably tall. We only watched a few more seconds and I told my son \"We have to run\". <BR><BR>We ran nonstop back to my family''s camper. My dad did not believe us. He thought it was a bear. I told him that there was no way it was a bear. Even a grizzly was not as tall as the smallest ones arm reach. I grew up in the area and I spent alot of time in the woods and it takes alot to frighten me! <BR><BR>The next day I went to the same spot and found several feet of tree branches and smaller limbs at the base of several trees. The trees had been stripped of branches and bark. Through the years I stopped talking about it because I felt like no one believed me or my son.",

    " It was the summer of 1983 or 84 and I was working for a company during the summer months trying to pay my way through college.  I worked 58 hours a week so I had little time to do anything else besides work.  I had purchased a tent and decided to go camping one Saturday night (it was in August as best I can remember).  Because of the hours I worked, this was the only night I could go camping (I also went to church on Sundays but I had plenty of time to get up and make it to church  service did not start until 10:00 AM).<BR><BR>After arriving home from work on the Saturday (date not known exactly) I planned to go camping on, I packed my backpack with all the necessary items for the short stay including my new tent.  I left the house and hiked the mile or so to the area where I planned to camp.  Also, my dog accompanied me.  He was a fairly large collie dog weighing about 80 pounds.  This dog was very intelligent and to my knowledge was not afraid of any animal (this is an important fact to this incident).  I had never seen him back down from a fight.    <BR><BR>The area was forest (a mix of pine and eastern hardwoods) and consisted of 1,050 acres.  I knew this area well because I had hunted it for approximately 4 years.  I also hunted a farm directly adjacent to this property which consisted of 450 acres.  This area is surrounded by old farmland as well as other stretches of forested land.  I made camp on top of a ridge that was relatively flat for the area.<BR><BR>After setting up my tent and camp, I made a fire pit (It was the dry months and I did not want to start a forest fire) and started a small fire to cook on. At approximately 9:30 PM I turned in for the night.  At around 10:00 PM I was awakened by an animal call I had never heard before.  I can only describe the sound by saying it was big and had the lung capacity of a lion or an elephant.  It literally shook the forest and my chest.  <BR><BR>I have pretty much heard everything there is to hear in the eastern forests (life long hunter and geologist  I have literally spent years in the woods) and this was so completely different there was nothing at the time I could compare it to (recently, I heard the male gorilla recording that was posted on the BFRO web site and it sounded eerily similar).  <BR><BR>At first I was unsure of what I heard because I was half asleep.  The first time I heard the call it came from about 20 yards off to my left.  15 seconds later I heard the same thing directly behind my tent still about 20 yards off.  By this time I am setting up putting on my pants and boots.  Again, about 15 seconds later, I heard the same call off to the right of my tent about 20 yards off.  My hair was literally standing on end.  At this point, I was somewhat concerned that I was not hearing my dog bark or growl.  He was sleeping outside the tent and appeared to have left.  I grab an eight inch hunting knife and a wimpy flashlight I had with me.  When I pulled the tent flap back to shine the flashlight on whatever was making the noise, I noticed my dog backing up with his tail between his legs, the hair on the nape of his neck sticking straight up growling just barely audible.  <BR><BR>He could see what was making the noise but I was unable to make out any thing besides trees with the flashlight I had.  Whatever was out there, the dog kept his eyes on it.  I believed to this day that dog would have protected me to the death.  As I have already stated the hair on my body was standing on end and I was extremely afraid (I am 6 1,  220 lbs and dont scare too easily).  I believe whatever was making the sound was doing so in a threatening manner.<BR><BR>I left all my gear and only took the knife and flashlight for protection as I hiked the mile back out of the woods.  My dog constantly looked back.  He walked beside me the whole way out and would not leave my side.  I had to cross a couple of fields and I never saw anything following us but there were also stands of trees that ran beside the fields in the direction my dog was looking.<BR><BR>After church the next day, I went back and got all my gear and it was exactly like I had left it.  There was also food that was left untouched.  I scouted the area for tracks but found none.  As already stated, I was in thick woods and there was a heavy covering of leaves and such.<BR>",

I saw this large creature moving about the tombstones as if to be pacing back and fourth. It would stop sometimes as if to dig at a grave. It was very large, dark hairy appearance, ape like movements, shrugging of the shoulders and sometimes a hop to its step. It finally saw me and seemed to get upset when it started its shoulder movements and hopping motions, and it seemed to start toward me as if to run me away.<BR>It worked!  ",

    " It was back in probably the early 1970''s, Spring time, late at night (around midnight).  I was out riding down this road that had a farm on one side and an apple orchard on the other.  As I was driving there was some movement about two hundred yards in front of me going across the roadway from the farm to the orchard.  When the object got to the middle of the road it turned its head and looked in my direction, at this time I got a real good look at it, about 8 to 9 feet tall very heavy build, long lanky arms, long dark red hair, very long stride (about two and a half steps to cross road).  If I was to guess his weight, it would have been around 4 to 5 hundred pounds.  I was on a road with very little traffic (I was the only vehicle on the road at that time).  I got to admit, I was not a bigfoot believer until that night.  I didn''t tell anyone about this because I knew they would not believe me.  I was one of the chief officers in our local fire department at the time and I didn''t want people to think I was nuts.  Oh by the way, I did get close enough to see what it was or wasn''t.

The most recent sighting was 10-8-2006 and I''m telling you it was 7\"2 and huge, with big yellow eyes. It was watching my husband put our puppies in the fenced in dog pen. I just grabbed my 3 year old son and slowly walked to the porch. My husband didn''t even know at that time that he was being watched. Later on that night he seen something very big and he heard it walking closer to him.... He ran inside and we locked the door. He advised to me that it was no bear that could stand that tall, walk on hind legs!<BR><BR>The time we had seen 3 of them was at the beginning of September. I left rotten chicken outside and from the look of the leftovers it couldn''t be a small animal. The next morning about 5:00am we heard something big walking on the porch. then we heard the van door slam. My husband loaded the gun. We looked out the window, very quietly opened the front door. we heard a yelling noise and footsteps. There up in the woods across the road was 2 of them. they we''re standing side by side. one looked young and scared and hid behind a tree but the older one looked viscous and not afraid. He stood out in the open. my husband did fire a shot in the air to scare it away, which worked because  they ran.<BR><BR><BR>",

    "     In the fall of about 1960, while coon hunting with my grandfather and friend named Bill, we had an encounter with what I am now convinced was a Bigfoot. We had left our house, which sat atop a ridge and went down into our hollow.  We had planned to go down the creek about a mile to the next hollow, turn right up this hollow, follow it all the way up, and climb the hill back to the top of the ridge. We would then have an easy walk home on a gravel road, which was the main road in the area at that time. We were about three miles from the nearest blacktop road, which was WV RT2 running beside the Ohio River.<BR>    All was normal down the first hollow, but when we started up the second, the dogs returned in an agitated state, and began to growl and raise the hair on their backs. They refused to go up the hollow in the lead as they normally hunted.  Instead, they stayed close to the light, which was a kerosene lantern that lit a circle only a few feet wide. We also had a two-cell light, used sparingly to conserve batteries, and a six-volt spotlight, which turned out to have a dead battery.<BR>     No amount of encouragement from my grandpa could get the dogs to go do the job they had always done so well.  Another hundred yards or so up the hollow, they were even more nervous and sniffed the air with long, deep breaths. They stared intently into the darkness in the direction we were moving, and would not get more than a few yards away, all the while growling, acting in a way we had not seen before. Their actions were really beginning to annoy Grandpa and he was trying to let them know his feeling with a verbal assault on them, their ancestors, and their species in general, but they were unfazed and were staying just out of range of the toe of his boot. We were walking single file through briars and brush with Grandpa in the lead, and then me, with Bill bringing up the rear.\t\t<BR>    When we reached the point where the terrain started getting steep, somewhere from eighty to one hundred yards straight ahead, there came the most bloodcurdling sound I have ever heard. After another forty or so years of life this sound is still very clear in my mind. It began as a deep bellowing roar that went higher in frequency and ended with a very high AHH EEE EEE EEE as best I can describe it. It lasted six to seven seconds. The hardest thing is to try to describe the volume other than to say it could have been heard for miles, and I know of no known animal anywhere that can howl, yell, scream, roar, or trumpet that loud. Whatever made this sound had to be huge. It seemed as if my hair stood up and I had a bitter taste in my mouth, I suppose from adrenalin.<BR>     We froze in our tracks for a few seconds then instinct or reflex made me turn to run, but Bill was blocking the path. Grandpa, who was hard of hearing, turned and said, &#8220;What the hell was that?&#8221; He was born less than a mile from this exact spot and had spent his life hunting, trapping, and just walking these hills. He was the best woodsman I ever knew, so if he didn&#8217;t know what it was, I sure as hell didn&#8217;t know. It would be several more years before any of us ever heard of Bigfoot. Bill also was a true woodsman, who had gotten game and herbs from these hills all his life. I was about fourteen and had been hunting with these men since I could walk well enough to follow them.<BR>     By now all the dogs except one were nearly under our feet, making it difficult to walk. We were hunting with four mature plot hounds, weighing about seventy or eighty pounds each. Also along was a half grown pup, having fun and learning his trade. He was also the one that showed no fear, and took off in the direction of the scream. A plot hound is a large breed used in our area mostly for coon and groundhog hunting, but is also used for bear, boar, and mountain lion as well. Plots are usually known as a bold and totally fearless breed, but not this night. The dogs were a sorry sight, cowering beside us with their tails now tucked, except for the pup, who was now going full bore to investigate the scream.<BR>    We stood there and just listened for quite a while. There was only silence, except for the pup trotting up the hill. The leaves were very dry and we would have heard anything move, as we could now hear the pup moving towards the source of the sound.<BR>     Grandpa and Bill now started talking about what to do next. Just seeing these big dogs this scared made me want to go back the way we came, but the men I was with were not used to backing up, and this time would be no exception. The sound had come from directly in our path, and after ten minutes or so we started on up the hollow, my vote hadn&#8217;t counted. Grandpa had now adjusted our course a few degrees to the left, which would take us to the top of the ridge, but on the other side of the gully. This would be a steeper climb, but would allow us to pass while staying several yards away from this animal. I always thought Grandpa led us on up the hollow so he wouldn&#8217;t look scared, but adjusted course a bit, because he wasn&#8217;t stupid, and had no desire to have a face to face encounter with what ever this thing was with a single shot 22 rifle and a pack of scared dogs as our only defense. I still had a lot of boy in me and could be as scared as I damned well pleased, and I wanted out of there real bad.<BR>    As we climbed the hill, we would stop occasionally and listen and could plainly here the pup in the dry leaves and knew he was getting near the source of the sound.  When we were nearly at the same level on the hill as this animal and maybe fifty yards away, we heard a deep-throated growl that lasted about five seconds. Shortly afterwards the pup returned, wagging tail as if he had had a great time. This growl was so low in frequency that it might better be described as a rumble, and was very similar to the low frequency sounds elephants use to communicate. I have since wondered if Bigfoot families could use this form of long distance communications. If they did, we probably wouldn&#8217;t be able to hear them very far. Had this growl been any lower in frequency, I don&#8217;t think a human could have heard it at all. <BR>    When we got to the top of the ridge and therefore out of the hollow, there was another scream that lasted about four seconds. This one was high-pitched and not as loud as the first. We were still within one hundred yards or so of this creature. The dogs now became much more relaxed, except for the pup, who thought the whole night had been great. We then went home without further incident.<BR>    I&#8217;ll never know what this animal was thinking when he bellowed and growled, but it could have been, &#8220;I&#8217;M here. YOU need to be somewhere else&#8217;&#8217;, because they seemed like warnings to me. I am now about the age my grandpa was at that time and have spent thousands of hours in the woods. I have never heard another sound like that. I am sure I will never hear an animal sound that loud again unless I once again run onto the &#8220;BIG GUY&#8221;. In my life time I have thought I was in danger several times, knew I was a few times, but have never been that scared again, but what the hell, I was still a boy!!<BR>",

    " We were riding our 4-wheelers in Mason Co WV, We were off of Greer Road on a friends property and stopped to get something to eat. This area we were at is not populated at all. I went over and sat on a log to eat and my husband asked me what kind of track was by my foot, When I looked down I was astounded! My husband wears a size 13 boot, And this was in cold weather so the thick boots make his foot look even bigger and this footprint made his look small! it was atleast 16 to 18 in long and 6 to 8 in at the widest point.There were about 3 or 4 more footprints leading down to the creek. I walked up and down the banks looking for more but I couldn''t find anymore. I am 5''9\" and have fairly long legs and I could not put my foot beside one of the prints and reach the other one. This was one of the most amazing things I have ever seen! Regretably none of us had a camra, but there were aprox 15 of us who seen these. Everybodys first reaction was that it was a hoax, but in my opinion if someone was going to fake this they would have done it in a more populated area. Our friend Jack , whos property we were on called the Department of Natural Resourses to ask them about this, they sent one truck down to look at the print. This truck left and came back with about 5 more trucks. They told Jack not to come back there while they were there. After they were done one of them stopped and told Jack that it was only a black bear print, I am no zoologist but I have seen black bear prints, and this was not one. There were no claw marks, but there were toes. And if that was a bear, and it left tracks that big, I wouldn''t want to meet it! This happned in winter of 2001, I have not told very many people because the ones I have look at me like I need to be locked up! I am very glad to find this site, and to share my amazing experince with people who understand! ",

    "A number of incidents over the years, but until now seemed unrelated. We''ve heard the sounds of \"screaming women\" and thought it may be a \"pather\" several times over the years. \"Whooping\" sounds, which we thought were owls. A dog returned home from fighting with something that had torn him with cuts pretty badly. A dog was found dead in his wire pen enclosure, and an impression of a large animal having \"caved\" in the wire. The dog had no marks on him and seemed to die of fright. One early morning hour last fall I was awakened by something pounding on the wood siding of my house, almost like an open hand or fist was smashed into it. Also, I was awakened in the late summer or early fall of 2008, with something very large (it sounded like a man walking) on the metal roof of my house and when \"he\" leaped off it seemed that he didn''t clear the edge and slipped nearer to my window which was on that end of the house. Very nearly scared me to death! I live in a modified A-Frame house, this was on a room addition which juts out toward a heavily wooded hillside. There are only a ten homes in this little valley that lies between two heavily wooded hills.",

    " Just two nights ago,( 2/16/09) my brother who lives up the hollow from my house called a little after 8 p.m. to say he had seen something outside in his yard. It seemed to be turned in the direction of his chicken house, at an angle to him, where it could keep a lookout both toward his house and the driveway which passes on up further into the hollow where there is another house. I have another brother that lives right across the driveway from the first brother. This brother says that two nights (2/14/09) before my brother saw what he did, he thought he saw something standing at the end of my 1st brother''s screened in porch, my second brother was smoking on his screened in porch, and when he opened his screen door to get a better look, my 1st brother''s pole light (which has a short in it) went out, and he couldn''t see anything at all in that direction then. A few years ago, a third brother and neighbor to these other brothers, was walking in the dark without a light to my 2nd brother''s house, and something screamed like a woman at him, and terrified him. This is a man standing 6'' tall and over 300 lbs. My 1st brother is also 6'' tall and over 300 lbs, and the creature he saw was taller and weighed more than he did. But he said it didn''t seem to be fat. It had reddish brown fur-hair. He did not see the facial features due to the profile stance the creature was in and he said that it seemed to be aware that it, my brother yelled out loud, \"What the heck is that!\" and ran toward his front door that opens to his screened porch, he said that he felt the creature heard him and knew it had been observed and when he went to the front door and stepped out on the screened in porch, it was gone. The dogs didn''t show up until my brother yelled for them. I myself have had a couple of things happen to me, that at the time they happened were unexplained but now I wonder if they are not related. Last fall my daughter and myself were leaving her house, she lives at the bottom of my hill near the creek, when something that screamed like a women terrified us. Then I heard what sounded like someone hit the side of my house under the breezeway where my bedroom is located, and I have had what sounded to me like a man walking across my house again over where my bedroom is located and in a minute or two it retraced its steps. I was very frightened to say the least! ",

    " My sighting occurred while working as a security guard on top of a mountain in Logan WV. I was working the graveyard (11pm-7am) shift on top of the mountain at a strip mine that was closing. The company was in the process of moving all of the expensive equipment to another site. I had a little trailer as an office and several large pieces of equipment and machinery surrounded the trailer. The location was sort of in a sinkhole that had been created at the top of this mountain..due to blasting. <BR><BR>I had just made a tour of the area,checking the equipment (probably 200 square yards total) and scanning the woods that surrounded the area. It was around 3am. I found nothing unusual and went back inside the trailer and turned on the radio to listen to a talk show that I had been listening to each night. I started to put on a pot of coffee when I realized that there were no filters. A little building outside kept all the cups, filters, coffee, condiments,  etc., so I walked out to the building and grabbed a bag of filters when I heard a rustle in the brush about 20 yards behind the trailer. I went inside the trailer and grabbed my flashlight and went outside to check out the sound. At first I saw and heard nothing. Then to my right was the sound of something taking off and running through the brush toward the mountain.<BR><BR>The beam of my flashlight caught sight of what I thought, at first, to be a black bear which are quite common in this area. However, as I looked closer, I saw what appeared to be a large bi-pedal animal squatting behind a large thicket about 25 yards from where I stood. The beam from my flashlight raked across its body. It shielded its face with huge hands and then ran off into the night. <BR><BR>Thirty five to forty minutes later, while sitting in the trailer (with the door firmly locked and pistol in hand..lol)  looking out the window, I heard what can only be described as a scream that absolutely chilled me to the bone. I have goosebumps now just thinking about it. <BR><BR>This was about 16 years ago. I have tried many times to convince myself that it was a bear. Deep down I know what I saw that night was not a bear or any animal that I have ever seen or heard, before or since. I really do not know what it was that I saw that night..and have never told anyone until now because I know that most people will just think I am crazy. I don''t make any claims as to what it could be but since then I have researched the \"Sasquatch\" legend and read many books and features on the legend itself. <BR><BR>The only thing I can tell you is this; when listening to a sound recorded in Ohio (I think) it sounded almost identical to the sound that I heard that night. The sound, more than the sighting scared me the most! It was like nothing I have ever heard before or since, except the recording from Ohio. After about another hour on the hill, I got up the nerve to jump in my car and get the hell off the mountain. I never went back to work there again. <BR><BR>I talked to a guy that worked that area for years and he said that he had never seen anything but had heard some very strange screams, he attributed them to mountain lions or bobcats what I heard was no feline. Anyway, I am glad to see so many others have had similar experiences. Keep up the good work. Maybe someday we will find out just what it is that roams our mountains and forests. Who knows?<BR>",

    " I''m a 65 year-old physician living in Ocala Fl. I grew up in Huntington WVa. When I was 14yo I was with my best friend (Bill Roberts) also 14yo and we were walking in the woods behind my grandparents'' dairy farm. We had a 22G rifle with us and we had been roaming around for about an hour when we came to a clearing at the top of a hill. We suddenly saw an animal neither of us recognized. When we first saw it, it was bent over doing something with its upper extremities. We were mesmerized for several minutes and did not move. It then seemed to become aware of us....what happened next really freaked us out. It stood up on back legs and looked right at us. we were terrified...it was very tall...blackish colored hair..also was skinny in appearance with a tapered face. It was standing at the edge of a pine thicket. It turned away from us and jumped over a barbed wire fence. Even though we had a gun we ran as fast as we could back to the farm house to relate the story to my grandfather. I know this description is somewhat different from what you''ve probably heard, but we saw an animal I''ve never seen before or since. S*******  P**** M.D.",

    " It was the summer of 1975, and I was about to enter the eighth grade at Stratton Jr. High School. My best friend had moved away from our neighbor hood in Beckley to Stanaford Acres in the spring. He had invited me to come out and spend the weekend with him in hopes of planning a fishing adventure down to Piney Creek. On Saturday morning, he and a common school friend of ours, and myself ,left out on foot at approx. 7:00am. With fishing gear,lunches and other necessities in hand, we made our way through the woods, past Kliningsmiths Pond, and over to the branch that would lead us to down to Piney Creek which was about a 3 mile hike. After spending the day fishing and doing things that teenage boys do we began to head back up the mountain. As we walked and talked, moving along the rail road that snakes its way through the gorge, it became apparent to us that we may not have been alone. Eerily we all had the feeling that someone, or something, was watching us, and following us from a distance. Paranoia began to set in, and we began to pick up the pace. By the time we reached the branch that we we''re to follow back up the mountain,time was slipping away, and the thought of getting caught in the dark became apparent.After an hour or so of hiking up the branch, the sun had lazily rolled over the mountain top, and although it was still early, it was begining to get a little dusky in the hollow. We had just stopped to take a breather when we heard rustling on an old logging road about 300'' feet above us. I had an old Red Rider BB gun with me, like it would have done any good, and it was rattling in my hands has they trembled. Maybe someone was watching us. Just in a matter of minutes, large boulders, the size of a washer or drier, came down, one after the other, headed right for us. We froze like stone statues, scared to death. After regaining our composure, we let up that hill side as though our feet were not even touching the ground. Thats when, against my better judgement, I turned to look back, just in time to see a large black shape disapear over the hillside. We ran all the way to Sams house, which was still a good mile and a half away. As the years went by, we looked back on that day and laughed at one another, joking about how scared each one of us were, and tried to come up with a reasonable explaination. I don''t know if what I saw was a Big Foot, or a figment of my imagination. But to this day, any time I''m hunting or fishing, on or around the New River Gorge National River,you better beleive that I''m looking over my shoulder.",

The Bigfoot blinked twice while looking at me and then stepped back behind the tree..I viewed it for about 20 seconds while it was looking at me..my mind just couldn''t figure out what it was and I knew what it wasn''t..I had no desire to shoot it and very well could have but my mind and body almost seemed to be in a state of shock while viewing it..I had to cross near the location on the trail out if the woods and I was F''n terrified even with a loaded deer rifle..my hair stood on end when I realized that I would have to go towards the location to get out of the woods..I called my uncle as soon as I got to my jeep and told him..he believed me..I am a VERY honest man and would never lie about this..the thing is though..I never heard it run away or move through the leaves..and you can hear movement from 200+ yards off in these woods..it''s like it just disappeared..I came home very shaken from the experience and it changed my life..now I know that it is out there. It was very cool looking..about 7ft tall, it had very dark large pupils and around the pupils its eyes were almost owl like..it had brownish blond fur and it had a visible face..it almost looked like the troll faces that you used to put on your pencils as kids..really..but, it was very clean looking and not what you would expect..its fingers were long and thick with no fur and it had dark fingernails..I had my scope on 9 power and it was equivalent to being about 30 ft from me visually..it was real and I would take a polygraph and swear on my life.",

It was very still and quiet out until we heard a few coyote''s howl followed by some frogs croaking. <BR><BR>Across the creek was thick with brush and small trees, there was a path that looked like led down to the water. While sitting on tailgate, we started to hear a sound of something walking down the side of the creek. You could hear it slowly taking what sounded like a two beat step. Too heavy for a deer, and too small for a coyote/cat. It hesitated at the pathway, then continued on to the left of us. It then made a loop to the right and came back up only farther away from the bank. Then we heard a hoot owl like sound very close to where we first heard the brush cracking. Then another hoot farther to the right as we could hear the footsteps fade in the distance. Then, about 5 minutes later, we heard a tree fall to the right of us across the creek where we heard the footsteps and hoot sounds.<BR><BR>After all this the frogs started croaking again.

    " I saw a dark shadow and at first thought my eyes were playing tricks on me but when I looked again I saw the outline of a Large man, but covered with hair. It was standing near the edge of the woods and at first I thought it was a statue. When I slowed down and looked closely it started to move backwards taking small steps, this really frightened me bacause even though I was in a car and it was moving away, I realized then what it was and that this thing was very much alive. The only way I can guess its height was buy looking at the pine trees he was standing near and I would say this creature had to be about upper 6 foot, maybe close to 7. With the broadest shoulders I have ever seen. If it was someone in a suit it was someone that should be playing pro basketball, not standing along the edge of the woods. I was close like 50 feet away from this thing at one point and it was early in the morning. I watched until it went so deep that I could not see it anymore, it turned around though and started walking at a better clip after I slowed down and watched for a while. I have not told anyone and never reported it, but when I was younger I believed in Bigfoot, but now I am 26 and was very skeptical the last few years knowing that this thing if it existed would need hundreds of square miles of remote area to be out of sight of people and I did not think anything in Ohio could accomadate that. Maybe out west it''s more thinkable, but Ohio does not even have a resident Black bear or Bobcat poppulation. Could this mammal be so intelligent and elusive that it could remain in our modern world? Does it bury its dead?....I mean somebody find out whats going on with this. Because not all these reports on here can be fake, I know what I saw! <BR>",

    " My sister Mary and I were heading to work at an early morning hour driving northeast on County Road 19 out of Calais, Ohio. My sister was lying back in the passenger seat when I noticed in my car headlights on the left side of the road the head of an animal in the creek bed. I said out loud what then heck is that? My sister became aware that I was looking at something and starting looking too. As I slowed down to see what it was, it came out of the creek bed on two legs and it ran right towards our car. It then ran along the side of our car (five feet away) for a few seconds. We noticed its brown shaggy hair all over its body and its immense size.  Being very scared, we sped off as quickly as possible fearing the animal was going to jump on our car. When we told people what we had seen, they said all we saw was a horse or a large dog. We both know that whatever this thing was, it ran on two legs, had brown shaggy hair, and was extremely large in size.  We estimate that this thing was close to eight feet tall and over 500 pounds in size. It was hard to get a good look at the face because of darkness and it being so close to the car.  There is no way it was a bear or a person.  ",

    " I grew up in the outskirts of a small town of Wellsburg, in the northern part of West Virginia. In the northern panhandle, ever since I was little we would ride our dirt bikes in the old strip mine, that was called center hill. Well years passed and that old mine was reclaimed, well we would still ride over there even though we were not allowed. It was summer because we where out of school. Id say it was probably 1989-1990, me and a friend went trail riding. <BR><BR>There was a flat area, and along the trail was a high wall, on the other side was a drop off, and a road. We would ride that trail to the gas line and cut up over the gas line to the road and go home, or we would turn around and go back through the trails. On the way through the trails there was a pit, we called it the sulfur pit, because it would turn your clothes orange, the color of the water was orange and deep on one side and shallow on the other side. It was like the rest of the trail it butted up against the high wall. <BR><BR>On the day I''m talking about,  I was on my bike and my friend was on his 4 wheeler. We went through the pit and was playing around. We ended up getting the 4 wheeler and my bike stuck. It took a long time to recover the machines. <BR><BR>Later that day we saw something walking on the top part of the high wall. It was not walking on the edge it was walking like along a tree line. We stopped and watched this thing walk to a tree and crouch down. I dont think it knew we were there until we yelled out at it for help. <BR><BR>The guy I was with said it was a friend of ours but we were out there where no one would be walking, even during hunting season. I think he said that so I would not flip out. You dont just walk out that far even during hunting season, cause if you get something there is only two ways to bring it out, up over the high wall or down the high wall. <BR><BR>Im getting nervous just writing this... We continued to yell out to this thing with no response back from it. We yelled out the name of the person that he thought it was several times.. no answer. We even yelled out if it could come down and help us. We did not know what it was.. So probably a good hour went by, and we were still trying to get his 4 wheeler unstuck, the next thing we know this thing gets up and walks the same way it came from. It was big and had long arms down its side. Walked upright like a person. <BR><BR>We watched this thing the whole time it was there, and it watched us working. We did not know what it was or what was going to happen. We did not know what it was going to do.. After it was out of sight we went back to getting his 4 wheeler out. Finally we got his 4 wheeler unstuck and my bike and got out of there. We had to ride the same direction it had walked. A couple days later we saw our friend that was supposed to be over there and he said it was not me. After that nothing else was said about it. We rode and hunted over there a few times. I stopped riding there when I started racing. <BR><BR>A couple years later (1991) when I was a freshman in high school, I took my girlfriend at the time over there. We were just out walking, and a hill that you had to go up to get to the path that went up into the woods. We got to the top of of this hill and heard the brush move, then a grunt noise, and a growl. I turned to her and told her to walk down the hill then run. We left there as quick as we could. <BR><BR>At one point I remember being at my friends house (the same one that got his 4 wheeler stuck) and we were talking with his mom. She said to me  you know there''s a Bigfoot over in the strip mine. I said No, really?!\" She said that her son saw the foot prints. I hunted that area a few times, rode dirt bikes over there and always felt like I was being watched. I have never told no one, just in the past year I told my girlfriend of 8 years. This is the first time I have come out and told anyone my story of what I saw that day, and the other time I was over there. ",

    " It was a warm June afternoon when my dog Sadie and I went for a walk back in the woods on our property. After we walked threw the woods on our property i decided to take the gravel road the mile or so back home instead of traveling threw the woods again. I got a half mile away from the house when i kept hearing something like a rock or a branch hitting against a tree. At first i thought it was just animals or my husband goofing off in the woods to scare me. When i reached where i thought the noise was coming from i stopped and was looking up into the woods, but i couldnt see anything, so i proceed to yell, ha ha very funny because like i said i thought it was my husband. Well the banging got louder then stopped completly. I got the feeling something was watching me so i told Sadie lets go girl and started to walk a little faster. Just then a fairly sized rock came whizzing out of the woods and just missed me. I stopped looked in the woods because i couldnt believe what just happend, but i still couldnt see anything. So, i really started to pick up the pace just then another rock came flying out of the woods and just missed me. By the time all this happend i was at the bend in the road and i looked up in the hollar where the last rock had come from when something i can not explain let out the awfulest low growl then scream i have ever heard. It scared me and Sadie so bad we took off running and i dont think i felt the ground under my feet i was running so fast. I told my husband about it when i got home and realized it was not him he had been there the whole time. A few days later he convinced me to take him back where it all happend and along side the road was a foot print that was fairly large but shaped different. I have not adventured back there since then and really dont care to.",

The pond is located well over a mile behind a gated forest service road off of a gravel county road that runs deep in the national forest above the Cranberry River.<BR><BR>It was likely the summer of 1985.  My best friend, Mark, and I decided to hike back to the pond to go bass fishing and camp for a couple days.  The weather was very nice and the first day had come to an end.  I had caught a bass and it was on a stringer staked to the bank of the pond.  We enjoyed a big fire (started with the aid of a Zippo can of lighter fluid), nice meal and good conversation at our own private paradise buried deep in woods.  The day ended typically with not another soul in sight.  <BR><BR>It was not long after we had lain down to for the night in our sleeping bags that we heard a bizarre howl or yell a good ways up the mountain above us.  It was like a woooooooop, woop, woop, woop sound.  It was a strong, very substantial sound.  The call was repeated a few times and then all became silent again.  We looked at each other, lightly illuminated by the campfire through the tent, and said, what was that?!  Even though we both grew up in the woods camping, hiking biking, hunting, and fishing, neither one of us had ever heard a sound like that before.  Unnerved, we eventually calmed down enough to start to fall off to sleep.  <BR><BR>Then, just inside the woods behind the tiny clearing where we were camping, we heard the call again.  It was jarring!  At a distance of less than 50 feet, the call of this creature blared though our tent!  WOOOOOOOOOOP, WOOP, WOOP, WOOP!!!  We both about died right there.  The sounds being belted out were not from an owl or fox or bobcat or any other creature we were familiar with.  Plus, this thing obviously had big with powerful lungs!  After the first couple calls, I decided that I wanted to see what was going to kill us instead of lying there like a sandwich in a wrapper.  So, I started to reach for my flashlight.  As the nylon of my sleeping bag made a slight sound, Mark clamped down on my arm like a vice grip and firmly whispered through his teeth, dont move!  I told him I wanted to see it.  Again he firmly whispered, dont move!<BR><BR>After a few minutes of bone chilling monster calls being directed toward us point blank range, all became quite again.  Eventually we felt comfortable enough to talk and could not determine what we had heard.  The only thing that we could think of was Bigfoot but the thought of it made no sense.  It took us a while, but we somehow eventually fell off to sleep.<BR><BR>The next morning we awoke in disbelief.  We reviewed our mental notes and realized that we had not shared the same nightmare but rather the same reality.  We had certainly heard something that we could not even begin to rationalize.<BR><BR>As we made our way out of the tent, the world looked the same.  It was a nice morning.  We decided to start a fire and fix some breakfast but our can of Zippo was not readily available.  Then we noticed a small pile of stones where we had left it.  Underneath the rock we discovered our lighter fluid.  Neither of us had covered the can up, and yet, there it was, covered neatly with a pyramid of rocks near the fire pit where we left it.  This was really odd since we were alone while camping in a place that is not readily accessible during the day, let alone in the night.  Plus, the covering of the can would have had to happen in the middle of the night since we were up half the night scared for our lives while the devil himself yelled at us.  We could only guess that a bigfoot had become offended by the smell of kerosene and covered it up himself.<BR><BR>A short time later we made our way down to the pond to do some fishing.  The first thing I did while down there was to check on my catch.  However, my fish was gone, stringer and all.  We each know that losing a fish and a stringer is not uncommon.  However, combined with the event, we thought that a bigfoot could have made off with our fish.<BR><BR>We each left there that day convinced that we had encountered a bigfoot at Glad Run Pond.  We have told this story over and over through the years and it still gives us chills.  My eyes even tear up a bit when I make the woooop sounds.  We each are still avid outdoorsmen.  The hours we have spent in the woods hunting and fishing and camping are substantial.  We even had mules for many years that we used for long multi-night camping and hunting trips into the WV wilds.  We still go to Glade Run Pond from time to time.  However, we have never heard that same sound or had a similar experience again.  Whatever happened that night will never be forgotten by the two of us.  We will be telling this story to our great grand children!<BR><BR><BR>",

I took a short cut through Cranberry Ridge that comes out in Camden on Gauley to get home. It was midnight (12:03 to be exact.) I was almost to the Webster County Line when I saw what I thought at first was some idiot in a monkey suit in the middle of the road in front of me. I beeped my horn at it.He started to run very fast, in long strides and then I realized it wasn''t a man. He wasn''t wearing shoes. His feet looked hairy. He was covered in reddish brown hair and about six feet tall. The hair was all even in length. He ran about quarter of a mile up the hill in front of me then tore through some elderberry bushes and disappeared down the mountain. I only got a really quick glimpse of his face so I can''t accurately describe it. The next day I went back and looked at the spot where he ran through the bushes. There were some kind of prints in the mud holes in the road and the elderberry bushes were broken and bent where it went through.<BR>",

On a mid-summer night around probably 3am, I had driven home, which was about a half hour drive. We had no neighbors and there were no lights on as I pulled up. I parked with the left side of my vehicle facing towards the wilderness line which was about 100 feet uphill. I got out of my car and closed the door. Immediately after my car door closed I had the loudest, most intense scream I have ever heard in my life call out from near the wood line. I ran for the door of the house and once inside I grabbed a shotgun, floodlight, and went back to look outside for it, from inside the screen door of course. I never saw a thing or found a sign of anything. This was the first of three times this happened to me, my mother who lived there as well and also worked late had it scream at her several times(she said 4 or 5) as well, and my brother had it scream at him once.",

    " I was alone, driving after dark from Belington, WV on US 250 North (two lane highway) toward Philippi, WV. About a mile out of town, I had just passed a small group of houses on the right. The highway curves to the right; there is a long guard rail on the right side of the road. As I was coming around the long curve, my headlights caught something up ahead, standing on the white line on the right side of the road. <BR><BR>At first I thought it was a very tall, lanky human, at least 64, with long reddish hair and a long beard, but as I got closer, I realized there were no clothes, just reddish brown hair over its entire body. The hair length and texture reminded me of a horses groomed mane, the hair was smoothed and not matted, and my impression was that it was a very tall monkey type animal. I did not see eyes, I got the impression it had closed its eyes when it was startled by my headlights. It stood frozen as if surprised by my headlights, very stiff, with extra long arms down by its sides. As my car went by it, it did not move, but was so close to my car I thought my right side mirror would hit it, but it did not. The incident lasted only about 10 seconds. My first thought was that it was a skinny Bigfoot, but that those things dont exist and if they do exist, they are not in WV, they are in the Pacific Northwest. <BR><BR>I kept going, as it really scared me, and there was no way I was going back to see what it was. I shook all the way home, I think because it resembled a human somehow, and because it was unlike anything I have ever seen, except in a zoo. When I got home, my daughter and her husband were visiting, we also had family from PA there. I told my family about it privately, they were skeptical, of course, and laughed about it. My husband does believe I saw something, but doesnt have any ideas about what it could have been. <BR><BR>I decided to look this up on the Internet and I saw there were incident reports and even expeditions for WV --- and that there is an incident reported for Barbour County! I almost had a heart attack when I saw this report was in the same area as my incident. I considered reporting it to you then, but was first discouraged from it by family.<BR><BR>I believe what I saw was some sort of animal, and I reasoned that it obviously isnt hurting anything or anybody, and I wouldnt want it hunted down.

    " I was hunting West Virginia''s late antler-less deer season in the Canaan Valley National Wildlife Refuge when the sighting occurred. I had gotten to the area shortly after 3:00pm that evening, and after parking my vehicle in the \"Camp 70\" parking area I hiked up what appeared to be an old logging trail directly behind the parking area. I had already gotten a late start and wanted to get afield as quickly as possible, so I decided to stalk along the logging trail until I got further into the river bottom. After hunting the trail for roughly 30 minutes I was able to see a long distance in the river bottom to my right, so I decided to move into the bottom in hopes a deer would emerge from the thick along the river at dusk. I came across another \"road\" after leaving the logging trail, so I started walking further into the valley on it. The road was frozen and crusted over due to the cold temperatures, which made traveling quietly impossible, so after a short distance I found a small group of trees a few yards from the trail and set up in them. Shortly after arriving I heard what sounded like brush breaking 150 - 200 yards below me, towards the river. I readied myself in hopes it was a group of deer moving into the flats to feed, but nothing appeared. A few minutes passed by and I heard the sound again, and again, nothing materialized. I decided to move closer, and positioned myself in another group of small trees 100 yards or so below my first site. I had been in this grove of saplings for 5 - 10 minutes when I caught movement in a cluster of trees that was about 80 - 90 yards below me and to the left. I could see the movement with my naked eye, and immediately upon seeing it I scoped the group of trees and to my surprise saw nothing. A few minutes went by and I caught the movement again, I quickly scoped the trees, and this time I was shocked by what I saw. At first I thought it was a large man, as the first thing I saw through my scope was a vague silhouette, but when my eyes focused I could see what appeared to be a primate-like creature standing upright and staring directly at me. It only broke it''s stillness to slightly move the upper portion of it''s body in an up and down motion. It would bend it''s knees as if it was going to sit down, then immediately straighten back up. This went on for what seemed to have been over a minute, then the creature exited the group of tree''s and moved to my left (the creature''s right), towards the mountain behind me. It walked across an expanse of river basin that I would guess to be 70 - 80 yards long before entering the timber and exiting my field of view. It kept watching me the whole time it was walking, only breaking it''s stare on me a few times to look directly ahead of it. I initially thought of attempting to locate it''s track''s, but my nerves got the best of me and I started moving towards the parking lot as quickly as I could. Though the creature never actually made any threatening movements, I didn''t feel safe enough to continue hunting and remain in the valley any longer after the sun went down than I had to. I immediately left the area and had no further incidents on the way to my vehicle.",

    " In June I was backpacking the Allegheny Trail going south bound. I had hiked up the trail following the yellow blazes. As I got to the top and started the trek along the ridge line I noticed some of the blazes getting harder to find with what looked like attempts to scratch them off. I say this because I would find the paint chips and bark at the base of the trees. It was raining on and off with a strong wind blowing West/Northwest. The trail had quit a few blow-downs and up-roots but I also would come across smaller trees broken off or up-root laying across the trail opposite the wind direction. I was hiking toward a shelter along the trail using my map book and came upon it late in the afternoon. The following morning I was awoken by a loud noise nearby. At first I could not identity the sound but then I realized it was to Flat Creek, stones being \"clacked\" together. The sound would at first be close by and then a few seconds later would be repeated farther away until it was almost out of ear shot and then it would return getting louder and louder passing by and diminishing in the other direction. It was in a north to south direction back and forth several times and then it stopped. Soon after that I felt and heard movement on the outside of the shelter and something stepped heavily on an old plastic tarp that was left spread out along the side of the shelter at that point I yelled \" get out of here\" and I did not hear any thing more. It was very unnerving.",

Well as I got to the end of the drive way the bus came and stopped and I went across the street to get my little girl off the bus and I turned around and at first was talking to my daughter I didn''t look straight ahead in front of me but when I looked up I noticed a very large brown figure standing below my porch which was second story and as I walked up holding my daughter''s hand it just stood there staring at first I couldn''t figure out what it was I have been in WV all my life and had seen many bear, bobcats and even a cougar. So I knew this was not any of these and it was standing at least eight foot tall with man like features it had kind of a flat nose its eyes were shaped like an owls and it blinked several times it didn''t move the whole time we were walking to the other side of my porch to go up the steps. In fact we even looked down on it from the upstairs porch.

    " A friend and I were out training my red-tick coon hound on Saturday Aug. 2, 2008. We drove up a familiar dirt road. We drove to the end and were on our way back when the dog had struck out of the back of the truck. I got out, turned on my mining light, and walked to the back of the truck.<BR><BR>I opened the tailgate and let the dog loose. I stood beside the truck watching the dog sniff around in the road for a minute or so. I was shining my light around in the woods around me, when I saw a set of eyes looking at me. The eyes were a bluish green color and appeared to be 5-6 foot off the ground. I stood and watched it for at least 2-3 minutes wandering what it was. I hollered at my friend who was still sitting in the passenger side of the truck to come and look and tell me what he thought it was. We both stood there watching it, trying to figure out what it was.<BR><BR>The creatures eyes would blink every now and then but it did not show any fear toward us or the dog. It was about 40 yards or so from us just enough so you could not see its body. We wanted to get a closer look so we decided to walk toward the creature. <BR><BR>We only had 1 flashlight and for us to get closer we had to cross a small ditch and a broken down fence. I was trying to hold the light on the creatures eyes, and hold the light so my friend could see so he did not fall. As we struggled to get across I noticed the eyes disappeared. We hollered for the dog to come with us and we walked approx. 40-50 yards to where the creature was standing but did not see anything. <BR><BR>We stood there for about 5 minutes talking and letting the dog sniff around, but he acted a little nervous. We started walking back to the road. When we got back to the road we were about 60 yards from behind the truck. As we were walking back to the truck, I was hollering for my dog to come on, and I shined my light up in the woods where we left from, and the set of eyes returned.<BR><BR>We looked at it for about 15 seconds then noticed a second pair of eyes this time, The second pair of eyes were orange- red color and seemed to be taller than the first set. At this time we were spooked and made our way swiftly to the vehicle. When we got to the vehicle, we got inside and I shined my light out the window and both sets of eyes were staring at us blinking and showing no fear. <BR><BR>I started up my truck and hollered for my dog to come on let''s go. The dog jumped in the bed of the truck, I jumped out, ran to the back, and hooked the dog up. I ran and got back in the truck, I shined the light out the window on the creatures, still staring at us, and my red-tick coon hound seen the creatures standing in the woods and started barking with every breath.<BR><BR>The creatures continued to stare at us blinking and showing no fear. We decided it was time to get going. We started driving down off the hill. We drove a couple hundred yards and the dog was still barking with every breath. From the way the dog was acting, I felt they were following us. I shined my light uphill beside me and sure enough, there they stood. I watched both of them follow us for about 1/2 mile.<BR>",

    "  There is a church where I attend services. We were practicing our Christmas play on the evening of November 12th 2001. It was about 8:45 p.m. when we finished practicing, when myself (age 17) and 3 other teenagers (15, 14, and 16) decided to go for a walk, while the adults stayed inside to talk.<BR>My cousin ran ahead and hid behind a pine thicket. These pines are in someones yard, they are probably about 12 or<BR>13 ft. tall, and they are all in a row and real close together. Myself and the other two decided to turn back and head toward the church, not realizing that my cousin was not with us. We were to the end of the pines and starting up the church driveway, when she came running out from behind the trees screaming at the top of her lungs and stating that she had seen something.<BR>Just as I turned around, I saw a Very Tall and muscular looking figure walk out from the trees, and cross the road. It was about 7 to  7 1/2'' Tall and slightly hunched over swinging it''s arms well below it''s thigh area, almost to the knees. It turned it''s whole upper torso area and glanced at us while it was walking up the hillside. After we got into the car my cousin, still very petrified, stated that when she was behind the pine trees, something about 5 feet away from her pulled<BR>back a branch on one of the trees as if to get a better look at her.<BR>She stated that it''s eyes were very far apart and sunk deep<BR>into it''s face. She said the hand was 3 times the size of my uncles hand,(he is a large man, and he is her step father). She said that the hand was covered on top with coarse looking hair and it had black fingernails. She said she didn''t smell or hear anything.  She said the reason was, that her face was so cold and her nose was plugged up and she couldn''t have smelled nothing anyway. She said the creature was very tall about 7''-7 1/2'' tall and very muscular. It''s forehead was sloped and the top of its head looked like it had tufts of hair coming into a peak.<BR><BR>Note; (This is exactly the way she described it to my family and hers.)<BR><BR>",

I''d go onto the place after the workers left for the day at 3PM.<BR><BR>It was rather hot and plain nasty so I usually headed out after 4 -5 PM. This day they were at the far end of the valley (or \"holler\" as the locals call it-I''m from CA originally). I was armed as there are wild dogs, bears, and a black panther running round back here.  Walking to the far end there are two smaller branches off to your right, the first is shallow and only extends a few yards.<BR><BR>Every time I walked to base of the hill before, I felt like I just didn''t want to venture into the woods. I had found another way onto the ridge above on the right a few months before-but I also got pretty badly spooked and kind of stayed away.<BR><BR>I had trails and just went wherever-until the loggers hit this patch. The past few weeks before this I had roamed all over the logging trails and as soon as they got back there I began to feel very uneasy. Walking alone, I decided to keep looking around staying extra cautious.<BR><BR>This day I went left and followed a trail that took me to the ridge top which is dead center of the valley. I also had a very \"something is watching me\" feeling so I wasn''t what you would call happy, just taking note of where things were and enjoying the view.<BR><BR>The trail followed along this ridge and would take me near where I had all the strange feelings. I stopped as the feeling of being watched was getting a bit too much when I heard a tree fall, just on the other side of the ridge not more than about maybe seventy yards away. I was wondered just why in the hell would a tree fall but something told me not to investigate and to get off that hill.<BR><BR>I decided to turn around to call it a day. I walked maybe ten yards when something loped between two trees on the ridge to my right. My first thought was some loggers or forestry guys were still on the property. It looked to be wearing Carhart brown clothes. I went maybe twenty more yards and then it hit me: I had been on that ridge a few days before, I knew where those trees were and if, IF it was a man he had to be around seven to eight feet tall.<BR><BR>A day or two later I went back to the ridge where I saw the thing and took a good look. I never felt any real strangeness on this side and didn''t then, but I did confirm that whatever I saw was very big. I also could swear I saw the right arm and leg but not the head, thinking back it was kind of leaning forward as it walked along so the head was behind the tree when I noticed it.<BR><BR>",

    " There are three encounters that I have had not in the physical or in another words I did not have a visual sighting but had heard weird behavior in the woods.<BR><BR>To begin with I am a 40 year responsible adult male and I have not told anyone about these encounters or experiences that I have had for fear of being ridiculed and/or being labeled as loony by my friends, family and the community. I found this website many years ago on my own by accident and was surprised to read about others who had the same experiences as I had. I finally found the courage to tell you what had happened to me.<BR><BR>I have been in and lived near the woods all my life. In my family hunting is a tradition. All the animal noises and natural sounds of the woods I know and am familiar with and have honed over time a very acute sense and perception that most hunters have or any outdoors man would have honed. <BR><BR>I would go sqirrel hunting often after work along some railroad tracks that ran just a quarter of a mile from my home at the time. One late fall afternoon I was just walking with my .22 mag rifle at the ready quietly along the tracks when I heard a noise or a rustling of leaves in the woods when I suddenly stop and stood motionless while I scanned the woods with my eyes looking for the source of the noise thinking it my be a large gray or fox squirrel. After awhile I did not hear nothing more so I moved on.<BR><BR> Now I have hunted alone many times and had never been afraid of anything but just after I had moved on I began to hear what sounded like foot steps in the woods just behind me and parelling me 50 to 75 ft. away. At first I thought of deer or a dog or a person walking up in the woods and after a few minutes I decided to call out to who ever may be there and let them know that I was where I was there for safety precautions. Well there was no reply and I called out a couple more times just to be sure. No reply. So as it was about 1/2 hour before sunset I was compelled to call it quits for that day and head back to my truck which was parked about a mile back near the RR. <BR><BR>Whatever it was proceeded to follow me keeping pace with me at a parallel distance of 50 ft. It became more and more clear that what ever it was was heavy and big for several times along the way back I heard loud heavy branches breaking and heavy footfalls that I know could not have been a deer or bear (there has not been a bear seen in the area that I was hunting for as long as I can remember nor have I had ever found any sign of one in that area.). Every time I would stop it would stop and when I moved it moved this when on until I came to the area near where my truck was parked and was an opened field. Whatever it was followed me right up to where the wood line was about to end and the field begin. <BR><BR>The other encounter happened in the same area only a year or two later and this time the unknown animal was shadowing me on the other side of the tracks between the tracks I was on and the river. There was a heavy growth of rhododendron bushes that ran the entire length of the shelf of land that was about 50 yards wide from the river to the tracks. <BR><BR>There is an embankment that is an accent of 75 ft. from the rhododendron bushes to the tracks above where I was at. I could see the wake that this thing was making from time to time through the rhododendron bushes for it was right in the middle of them as it was keeping up with me, which was remarkable to me how it did that without exposing itself in some manner, but again I thought through all the possibilities of what it could be for there are few animals that would follow you for a mile stopping and starting in sync with your every step. <BR><BR>I never saw any part of it as it moved through the brush and even though I could see a wake made by the branches as it moved through the thick brush it was only here and there, mostly it was if a large contortionist where moving through the heavy with the brush with the utmost of ease. <BR><BR>The third time was near spruce knob in Pocahontas County, WV while on a field trip for a summer class I was taking in the spring of 2003 some of my fellow classmates and I were outside one night trying to call in Bard Owls. After some minutes later we heard a few in the pine trees near our camp returning our calls. <BR><BR>We were having fun with our success with calling them in and after 30 minutes we had called in 4 or 5 more in the pine trees that bordered the road across the road from our camp. Then all of a sudden while in the act of making more calls we heard a huge commotion up on the hill about 75 yards. from us it sounded like a couple of huge guys romping around and making the Bard Owl call, we all stood there trying to make out what it was but could not see anything. Someone shined a flashlight in the direction of the sounds and they ceased immediately. <BR><BR>We did night hear anything more on that hill that night. I do not know for sure what it could have been but would not rule out that it could have been a bigfoot. ",

Then we saw its side arm move and it looked like it was below its knees.

    " My older brother and his son decided to try and get a picture of this creature.  They took their 4 wheeler back to the second field that is just behind the one it has been seen in.  The waited for it to walk in.  After some time of sitting they started to smell a horrible stench. My brother stood up to look in the woods behind them and he saw the creature squatting down behind a tree.  My brother then moved to get a better look at it when it stood up and left.  He then went to look for it and saw it foot imprint on some leaves on the ground, he said they weren''t very good but he could see that its foot prints where about 5 feet apart. <BR><BR>My older brother, his wife and 6 year old son were riding on their 4 wheeler back in old 93 hollow.  It was between 7:00pm - 8:00pm when they saw what they thought to be a black bear walking on its hind legs.  They stopped the 4 wheeler and turned off the engine to watch it. When they did this the creature also stopped and was watching them.  My brother and His wife saw the creature and they looked at each other over a distance of around 200 feet for about 2 minutes.  My sister-in-law described it to me this way.  When it turned to face us, I could see through its legs.  Its legs were not touching together.  Its arms hung down its side just above its knees, and its shoulder and mid drift were real broad.  It had fur from head to toe.  <BR><BR>Two minutes later the creature took off into a stride across the field with its arms swinging at its side and a slight bend to its form.   At the end of the field it turned and went into the woods.  At that distance they could see it as it walked through the woods.  They figured it to be about 8 - 9 feet tall.  They said it could not have been a bear walking on its hind legs covering the distance it covered in the short time it covered it.   They watched it enter into the woods and then went home.  When they got home their son, scared from what he had just seen, started crying.  He swore to his mom he was never going to ride his bike or motor bike in that hollow ever again. <BR><BR>The next day my brother took my younger brother and my uncle back in the hollow with him to see if they could find any tracks this creature had made.  They searched but did not find any, it was over grass and it rained most of the night.  So my older brother gave up and went home leaving my younger brother and my uncle in the hollow.  Shortly after my younger brother and uncle saw the creature.  They were in the same location as my other brother was the night before.  They watched it come out of the wooded area about 400 yards below them and cross the road.  It went down the a hill into a valley where they couldn''t see it.  Then suddenly it came up on the other side of the hill and walked along side the edge of the field and entered the wooded area where it did (or another) the night before.  My brother got to see it through his binocular and said it looked like a pro basket ball player but much more muscular with fur from head to toe.  He said all he could see was its back side and it wasn''t anything he had ever seen before.  My brother also said he yelled at it but it didn''t faze the creature at all. <BR><BR>Two days later, in the morning my older brother and his wife went to the same area to go mushroom hunting.  They were in the power lines when they heard a loud knocking on one side in the woods, like someone hitting something on a tree.  Across on the other side, where one old dilapidated house was, they heard something screaming.  My brother described it as a high pitch hunting dog scream.  They said this went on continuously.  My brother started to walk down toward the house to see what it was.  The closer he got the more it spooked him, so he went back and got on his 4 wheeler leaving his wife on top of the power lines.  His wife said when he started up his 4 wheeler and headed down the road toward the house the knocking got louder and the screaming got louder and more intense.  She said the one that was in the woods knocking started crashing through the woods in the direction that she was in, then stopped when it heard the 4 wheeler turning back.  My brother, who turned around because the screaming was so loud he heard it over his loud 4 wheeler, then got his wife and left the area shaken up a little.  They didn''t think the creature would be there in the morning, they thought they slept during the day or something. <BR><BR>They and other people have gone back to the same area in the two days since the last encounter and nothing was found or heard. <BR><BR>",

    " On Nov. 24th 2015 I was hunting deer during FIREARM season back on the hill behind my house...I am going \"bonkers\" for lack of a better word, trying to process what I saw that day. I was walking up an old dirt road, the ground was wet, leaves etc. so I was very quiet. I reached an area where I was looking down into the forest , I raised up my binoculars because I, at that moment, was expecting to see a smaller black bear...as I was looking at its back I noticed a very thin white hair line running down the middle of its back...I thought that''s a strange marking for a black bear...I continued watching this \"creature\" for quite a few minutes...I wanted to see its face...slowly it turned its head and as if it were looking into my eyes through the binoculars. Its face was solid black of the blackest night, very shiny, looked almost like black leather stretched tight, its nose was very wide and had huge nostrils, it seemed to be hunkered down by an old fallen tree and it was in the sunshine that was beaming through parts the forest, it had no hair on its face..everything was black ..its face looked human, I could see ears like mine only black its hair on its body was a lighter black than its face and somewhat thin (compared to a black bear''s) and it wasn''t dirty or mangled, it looked clean. In the mean time as I was steadily watching it, small sandstone rocks were coming down by me from the road above I didn''t want to turn and look, I was watching the creature below me and figured it was chipmunks running around behind me causing small rocks to fall but after seeing that face I had to look...I saw nothing behind me...when I returned to using the binoculars and looking for it ...It was gone... no sound what-so-ever. I now feel that something behind me was trying to get my attention so it could get away. Someone said that it was probably a man in one of those strange looking suits to hunt in...my reply was \"he needs to get mental help immediately for the fact that everyone on this mountain this week are carrying high powered rifles\". (I never once felt scared or threatened, all was calm) I saw no limbs arms legs.. I was focused on its head... It wasn''t huge like the width of it...as I stated before from behind looked like a small bear (except it had a human like face)... I would appreciate any feed back. (forgot to mention that in October and part of November during bow season I heard some very strange sounds during 3 of my hunting days up there...I call them \"jungle sounds\" ooh ooh ooh aah aah aah woooo repeated at a fast pace)",

    " It was Thanksgiving night of 2003 at around 11:30pm. I had taken a friend of mine home and was driving back on route 50 near Burlington, WV (that''s in Mineral Co.) I came around a turn and slammed on my brakes to avoid hitting what I thought might be a very large dog. <BR><BR>I barely missed hitting it and as soon as I stopped I realized that this was definitely not a dog. It was too big. It was on the right side of the road, crossing to the left. It was black and walking on all fours, its front legs were longer than the back legs. I was petrified. I had no idea what it was. <BR><BR>When it got to the left side of the road it turned and looked at me, its eyes were glowing orange in my headlight. I couldn''t even scream. I had chills all over and tears were rolling out of my eyes. I sped home which was about 4 miles away and ran into my house. I was hysterical and crying and I woke up my mother and told her about it. She believed me. <BR><BR>Other people didn''t believe me and I was made fun of. I referred to it as a \"black demon\" basically because I didn''t know what it was. I can''t drive by that place in the dark to this day without thinking of that creature and praying that I never see it again and if I do that someone will be with me. Seeing a picture of the Jacob''s Creature on MSNBC tonight prompted me to check out your website. It looks exactly like what I saw that night<BR>",

    " Around 1:00 am on October 1st, I got up out of bed to get a drink of water and was having trouble falling asleep. As I walked by my kitchen window, I peered out and noticed three pairs of red eyes walking single file about 20 yards up in the woods. I''ve been a hunter and outdoorsman since I was 6 yrs old and have seen many animals and eyes at night so I wasn''t all that surprised. But what really had me perplexed was the height at which the eyes were above ground level. I would estimate that the eyes were hovering around the 7 ft mark at least so that rules out any wildlife that I''m familiar with. The intensity of the glowing red was also unlike anything I have ever experienced or seen before and the creatures appeared to be walking with comfortable balance and agility. It was pitch black and could not make out any silhouettes except a few branches moving. There is 4 miles worth of wilderness behind my house and most of it is government land. I have no idea what I saw that night but am open minded to it being a sasquatch or another creature that I''m unfamiliar with. Have not talked much about it to other people and am afraid people will think I''m losing it but I can''t stop thinking about what I saw. Thanks very much!",

    " So much time has elapsed since this incident, so I am not sure of exact dates and times, so those aspects will be approximations.  However, I DO remember EXACTLY what I saw.<BR><BR>It was approximately 9pm, and it was dark and cold.  I believe it was around Thanksgiving.  My girlfriend lived, at that time, on Green Mountain, about 6 miles outside of Keyser, WV.  The area is hilly to mountainous and I will enclose a mapquest picture of the area (although it has changed a bit since the picture was taken).  It is technically Rt. 46/4, and the sighting occured along this route, what is  now known as Green Mountain Road locally, but older maps may list it as \"Hoover Hollow Road\".  <BR><BR>I was returning home after dropping her off.  I was alone and beginning my descent back down the mountain, at approximately the halfway point.  <BR><BR>The road changes levels several times in a short distance at this point; many dips and slight rises before the meat of the descent begins.  I was in this section and on one of the rises when something on the left side of the road caught my attention.  There appeared to be someone sitting on a log on the bank above the road; the \"person\" looked at me and I realized it wasn''t a person at all.  The motion of the creature-- for lack of a better term-- indicated that I had startled it-- very sharp, quick movements.  The eyes glowed yellowish/amber as my lights hit them; the being had long brownish fur with strands of white (maybe) through it; it appeared matted, or dreadlocked; the feature that struck me most was the size of the thing-- I can''t even imagine the actual numbers but, I have a 300 pound Brother-in-law and a 6''3\" tall Brother and they both would have been dwarfed by this guy, both in height and weight.  I would conservatively estimate the creature to have been at least 400lbs and every bit of 7 feet tall.  Upon seeing my car, this creature stood up and jumped from the bank, landing somewhere near the middle of the 2 lane road, and began to run from left to right, into a deep pine and laurel thicket.     <BR><BR>I do not know why, but I stopped near the point that the creature entered the thicket and turned my vehicle off.  My windows were rolled down slightly, so I could hear the thing running through the thicket-- the sound receded quickly, as if it was moving with considerable speed.  I listened for mere seconds, before recognizing the stupidity of my actions forced my hand and I continued on.  <BR><BR>As I drove on, I saw what appeared to be a fire burning directly ahead of me.  The road bends to the right and the fire was actually on the same side of the road as the point where I observed the creature.  Around the fire, I saw several people.  They were talking and partying.  To me, it appeared that the spot where the creature was sitting was a PERFECT observation point for the happenings at the campfire.  And, I remembered him (I say \"him\" because I got the distinct impression of masculinity from this enormous creature-- barrel chest, thick arms and legs and just a \"maleness\" to it''s movements) turning his head to face me and it turned in a way to suggest that it was looking TOWARD the clearing where the fire was burning.  I remember thinkin, \"Huh...  He just wanted to see what they were doing\".<BR><BR>I immediately called my girlfriend after observing the campfire.  I told her that I think I just saw a Bigfoot, and I related what I saw.  She panicked and told me to come get her, but I was too spooked by then to turn around.  ",

    " August 1974 I and my three friends Tom, Byron, and Jay went camping with their parents who slept inside their camper while we slept on the ground with a plastic tarp draped over us.  It had been raining the day before.  Around 2 am I was awakened by an eerie screaming.  It sounded like a woman was being murdered.  It freaked me out.  The screaming was across the Stillaguamish River which was about 50 meters from where we slept and into the forest on the other side.  Across the river was a steep incline into the rustic forest and beyond that was nothing but wilderness all the way into Canada.  The screaming became louder and louder as the thing that was screaming was getting closer.  I heard it walking down the steep hill on the other side of the river, and then I heard it walk up and down the other side of the river, screaming all the more.  It was very loud and very scary.  It gave me the impression that it was angry.  Angry at us for being in its area and it wanted us out.  That was my impression.  I was scared to death and I did not know what to do.  Then, suddenly, the thing walked across the river towards me!  It came to my side of the river and began to walk up and down the river bank screaming all the louder.  Then it stepped on a fallen tree that was on the river bank and I heard a snap as the weight of the thing broke the log as it stepped on it.  Then the thing walked up to me and my friends and came within 10 feet of us and screamed some more.  I thought it was going to kill us.  Just then I noticed the terrible odor that this thing had.  It was overwhelming!  It was so strong it made my eyes water.  I was petrified.  I was too scared to move, to speak, to do anything.  I really thought it was going to kill me.  It was lasting forever!  This thing was standing over top of me, screaming, smelling horrible, and scaring me to death.  Then he started to simply walk away.  It went back to the river and walked across it to the other side.  Then it climbed up the steep hill and into the forest screaming all the time.  The screams became farther and farther away.  When it was a good distance away I started to believe that it wasnt going to kill me.  I then asked my friends, Tom, Byron, Jay, did you guys hear that?  They all three jumped up and yelled at me yes what the hell was that?  It seems they were just as terrified as I was and were frozen stiff with fear.  The entire episode lasted for approximately 25 minutes.  What did I see?  I saw nothing because it was pitch black dark.  I heard and smelled everything.  It was as real as it could possibly have been and we are convinced that it was some kind of monster.  It walked on two legs just like a human.  I have been shot at, artillery shelled, sniper shot at, have had a hand grenade tossed at me, survived an ambush, and IEDs while in combat.  I have been attacked by a 12 foot shark while scuba diving.  I have been face to face with three adult man eating lions that were pets of Saddam Husseins son.   Nothing can compare with the fear that I felt this day.         ",

I know the story of course but never payed any real attention to it until I came home from the trip.<BR><BR>We arrived at the campground late.  There was only 1 other camper there with a RV.  We started into the woods around 5pm.  The terrain is extremely rugged and steep.  As we were hiking we noticed that it was very quiet.  Not a single bird call, or anything.  It was an eerie feeling.  We set up camp about 3 miles on the path that led up to the observation tower (High Knob).  We had dinner and got into the tent around 9-10 pm.  Around 11-12 pm my brother and I heard a very odd howl, it lasted for around 10 seconds.  It was not a dog or bear or anything I had heard before.  I thought it was strange but assured my brother it was nothing.  Around 2 pm my friend woke me up and pointed at his ear, signaling me to listen.  I paused and listened.  To me I heard what sounded like someone  slowly walking up to our tent, choosing their steps very carefully.  I whispered to him its a deer to calm his nerves.  But all three of us listened as the steps got closer.  The steps were heavy but slow.  My brother said to me \"Get the shotgun.\"  But not in a whisper.  The steps stopped and sounded like they went the other direction.  I got out of the tent and saw nothing, it was too dark.  The next morning we continued up the hill.  At the top of hill .5 mile from where we camped there was a large pile of feces with acorns in it.  Possibly bear, not sure.  My brother was in poor psychical condition and could not continue so we decided to leave.  <BR><BR>When I got home I decided to see if i could find an animal call matching the sound we had heard.  I looked up a lot of different animals, from cougars to foxes.  Nothing matched.  Until I found a bigfoot website with sound recordings.  The first one I clicked was it.  I called my brother on the phone and said recognize this?  Played the recording and he said \"Hell yeah, that''s what we heard in the woods.\"  <BR><BR>I''ve done a lot of research on Bigfoot since that trip and I''ll be going back there this November, I''ll try and do a few calls or knocks and see what happens.<BR>",

    " On August 30 2012 between 9:07-9:45pm. I was traveling to my father''s home in the Moyers area of Pendleton county, WV. I decided to stop along side of a small road, county rt 25 Moyers Gap rd. I stopped half way up Hoover mountian when I heard an unusual howl sounding like three woops (I''m pretty certain it was three). Being familiar with both wild animal sounds and those of farm animals I was startled because I immediately thought of sounds I''ve heard Bobo make on the show. I cupped my hands around my mouth and attempted to recreate the sound i just heard. I gave three loud woop sounds in medium tempo. After about 5-10 seconds I heard two woop sounds coming from the same direction as the first down over the mountain to my left. Again I cupped my hands and let out two loud woop sounds in about the same tempo as i had just heard. This time I heard a sharp crack of wood and a different type of howl, it sounded angry or frustrated maybe? to me. Unfortunately, a white gmc pick up truck began coming down the mountain. The loud crack and howl were the last sounds I heard that night. I waited for about 45 minutes in the truck I was driving, several times I attempted to get responses by making woop sounds none of my calls were returned again. I was so excited by this encounter. I will never forget it",

    " A buddy of mine and I had wanted to hike and camp in the Dolly Sods Wilderness in West Virginia, in the Monongahela forest. Basically, it was a weekend camp, hoping to spot game and look for trout water. Any thoughts of Bigfoot, (there had been previous reports) were largely in the back of my mind, although the prospect of possibly encountering or seeing evidence was exciting to consider. <BR><BR>The area is quite remote, and the terrain fairly rugged. We had parked the truck on a forest service road, and hauled our gear into the woods. We spent the early afternoon scouting about, after pitching our tent in a small glen surrounded by pine trees. We spotted some deer and raccoon tracks along an adjacent small stream, and looked for whatever sign we could find, then headed back to camp. As we sat there, the atmosphere of such wilderness led my thoughts to Bigfoot. To amuse myself, I got up and started to peruse the woods a bit. About that time, I heard footsteps behind me and turned to see a couple of men walking down a trail carrying garbage bags on their backs. They stopped at our camp and my buddy and I talked with them a few minutes. They had been collecting ramps. Ramps are like wild onions. And they had a good haul, about 40 lbs worth between them. Half jokingly and half serious I asked them if they had heard tales of Bigfoot in the area. Their eyes kind of flew open for a second, then they gave me a look like I was crazy. They didn''t say anything for a few seconds, then looked down at the ground, kind of averting their eyes. I quickly told them about the reports I''d read, but they seemed like they didn''t want to discuss anything. We talked a bit more about ramp selling and Appalachian festivals and such; and I asked them where the ramp patch was and they told us it was on the backside of the hill fronting our tent. Soon they had to leave, but curiously enough, as they were walking away, one of the men turned and said, \"Y''all watch fer them Bigfoot now!\" in a matter-of-fact kind of way. Well, after awhile, my buddy and I decided to take a little foray up one of the trails, and had an enjoyable time--spotting hawks, many birds, bobcat sign, squirrels, and even a Great Horned Owl. We also heard a Barred Owl. We sat in the woods and talked, and planned to do some predator calling after nightfall. I think it was about six o''clock by this time, so we headed back to camp get something to eat. We rustled up some food without cooking anything and the sun was lowering, the night was soon to be coming on. We were debating where we should go try to predator call. Not long after, I head what I can only describe as howls and chatter-like sounds emanating from behind a hill. My buddy had gone back to the truck to get a flashlight we had left behind. As I listened, I could differentiate three separate sources for the sounds. It seemed like they were near each other, not calling to each other from a distance. I also noted that hound dogs were barking off to my right and in behind me from maybe a half-mile away. The howl-like sounds lasted only 30 seconds or so. I just sat there astounded. My buddy soon showed up, and I asked him if he had heard anything. \"Hound dogs\" he replied. I didn''t say anything more to him about it, because I thought he might think I was gettin''nervy. Anyhow, I was primed for excitement that night. After supper, we sat up until late listening to the sounds of the night. Nothing unusual happened. Finally, went to sleep, but I''ll admit I was catnapping most of the night. The next day passed much as the previous one, spotted wildlife and nice hike up to the \"plains\", and then back to camp. We milled about the camp area, and planned to predator call that night....After predator calling, without much response except for two owls, we cooked up some ramps and potatos and talked ''til about midnight. We never bothered to make a fire. After the day''s hiking, a good sleep was welcome. About 2:30 a.m. I was awakened by the sound of our cookware being rattled. I lay there listening, and heard a buck snort. Then he stamped several times. The buck was after the ramps we had leftover from supper. Alright, I thought, back to sleep. I lay there waiting to drift off, listening to the buck mill about the camp. Then, I heard the buck snort loudly. Suddenly, I got an innate sense that something sizable was peering at the tent...I felt a presence there in the pines, which were about 15 feet away. The buck, after slowly moving away, finally bounded away from the glen. I fumbled around for the flashlight, not wanting to awaken my buddy. I couldn''t locate it. Of course, I was still listening intently for whatever was there in the pines. I heard no movement. But that feeling of being scrutinized was raising the hair on my neck. I deliberated what to do. I had no weapon, except a machete. No means of startling what I felt had to be Bigfoot. It was just standing there, there was no discernable movement. I was ''paralyzed'' as to what to do. Finally, I decided to do nothing, just lay there. I''ve had bears sniffing my tent and checking out my campsites before, and found that not confronting them is a good policy. I lay there waiting to see what would happen next. Maybe five minutes later, I heard tree branches moving and a few twigs snap. Then, nothing...I drifted off to sleep. Next morning, I awoke eager to check out the pine stand and campsite. I told my buddy about the buck visit, and decided to tell him about the strange presence lurking in the pines. He listened without saying anything. I wanted to look around, and evidently my buddy''s curiosity got the best of him, and he joined the search. After a few minutes, I found a footprint. It was about 16 inches long and maybe 5-6 inches wide. The big toe was quite clear, and the other ones just slightly less defined. The big toe was maybe two inches wide. The soil where the footprint was dry, kind of grainy not loamy. It was hard-packed and there were pine needles surrounding. The footprint was visible but not deep in the soil. My buddy was quite intrigued by the footprint. We talked about what I had experienced, and dawdled over the footprint. But, it became evident my buddy didn''t believe tht Bigfoot had made the footprint. Or better stated he wouldn''t accept what he was looking at. He even smudged the toes to make it undiscernable. Of course, I was caught off guard by that and made somewhat peeved.<BR><BR>Further thoughts: In retrospect, I feel kind of stupid for not having tried to look at the creature. At the time, I thought I was doing the right thing, it could have precipitated an attack. However, I could sense the largeness of what had to be Bigfoot. *I noticed the breathing,the inhalations of the creature as well, which further informed me of its size. ",

The funny thing is that they appeared ape like but the fur was short and I am really serious that these two creatures did not run they took a big head first dive into those bushes.  I did fish the next day but as far as camping that was a big OUT, NO WAY on this trip.                  ",

    " I didn''t actually see the creature, but was riding in the car with my boyfriend when all this occurred.<BR><BR>We were coming back from a trip to Ohio with a detour to see some friends in West Virginia. Instead of taking interstates home to Virginia, we took US 33, a very twisty mountain road, heading east. I was dozing in the passenger seat when I was startled by my boyfriend yelling \"what the hell was that?!\" I sat straight up, and noticed that whoever was in the car behind us suddenly hit the brakes and flashed up the high beams. We were only going about 30 anyway because we were rounding a curve, so he got a pretty good view of whatever it was. His first description was \"some guy was walking on the road in a tree costume.\"<BR><BR>After he told me a few more details, I yelled, \"Sasquatch! That''s what you saw!\"<BR><BR>I immediately took some notes.<BR><BR>This is what he says that he saw: human-like figure, at least six feet tall and very bulky, with very long hair (\"the hairiest thing I''ve ever seen\"). It was a mossy grayish green color. It was walking along the side of the road upright like a man, but slightly hunched over with knees bent and elbows sticking out (\"an ape-like walk, definitely not human\"). It had no distinguishable facial features, because it was so hairy. He says the arms were six to eight inches wide and the legs were wider, at least eight inches. The creature also did not react to the sound and light from our car or the one behind us. He says it was absolutely not a bear, deer or large dog.<BR><BR>Without our headlights, it was completely dark with just a little moonlight. The creature had no light source, and if it was a man (in a pretty elaborate costume), it was on a heck of a walk because there was not anything within reasonable walking distance, especially with no light.",

    "Nothing else noted at that specific location, but some years later a caver from the same group was with me at another bizarre event. About six miles to the south west of this camp location we found an unknown cave in a remote grazing area. The entrance was partially blocked by breakdown (boulders) but enterable on hands and knees after climbing over the rocks. Just inside the entrance there''s a low room with a stream in the floor that flows into passage heading down stream, deeper into the mountain. Blocking our way was the carcass of a large white tail doe. Something had been feeding on the carcass, as the entrails and soft tissue between the rear legs was pulled out or gone. Deer hair was also strewn about the floor and walls of the cave passage. We had to crawl gingerly over the carcass in order to push farther into the cave. It was relatively fresh (maybe a few days old) but odor had begun to kick in. Downstream of the carcass we noticed a red tinge in the water, blood was staining the stream. We had enough then, turned around and left the cave. My friend wretched once we got to the surface. We both wondered what kind kind of animal had the motivation and strength to haul a large doe up and over boulders and through a narrow entrance before stashing it. We assumed either bear or coyote and decided to come back well after the carcass would be gone. We''ve yet to return.",

    " On November 5th, 1994, I and six other cavers got together to do some ridgewalking and camping along several miles of limestone exposed on the east side of Seneca Creek, in the Seneca Creek Back Country. This is a remote and heavily forested section of the Monongahela National Forest, and lies on the western flanks of Spruce Knob, the highest point in West Virginia.<BR><BR>We planned a through hike, so I pre-positioned my vehicle down stream at the public parking area near the intersection of White''s Run and Seneca Creek. Then we drove around and upstream to the ****** trail head where we started out. Hiking along or off to the side of the trail we passed the entrances of a few caves that were located on previous trips (we''d been working this area for a few months already). The area is heavily forested with second growth hard woods that have grown up since the virgin timber was clear cut in the 1890-1912 logging era. We worked our way north toward and through a region known for a series of large, open meadows in the forest, left behind by homesteaders in the early part of the 1900s. We eventually found a number of small caves in that area, but none large enough that we could easily enter them (most would require some digging).<BR><BR>About halfway through these meadows we left the trail completely as it wandered up the mountain and away from the limestone. We continued north and across the last of the meadows, then into the trees. We crossed a couple more ravines and finally, at the end of the day, found a nice flat bench on a remote ridge to set up our camp. We were six or seven miles in from the trailhead and still had five miles to go before reaching my SUV at White''s Run. It was four miles or so as the crow flies to the nearest houses, on the far side of a big mountain. We were about as remote as you can get in that area.<BR><BR>That night we built a small fire and sat up to about 11 p.m., talking. The night was dark, clear skies but the moon had set, and not much starlight in the thick forest. We all backpack light so our light sources were no more than our head lamps and the firelight. The camp was dim. It was around 10:30 when I had just finished telling something of a spooky story. Everyone was a little keyed up I guess.<BR><BR>About 30 seconds after I finished the story, a single scream rang out from the woods behind me. It sounded to be 200 yards or more north, across the next ravine and on the next ridge we would head for the following morning. It was loud, but not incredibly so. It was unlike any cry I''d ever heard in the woods, and didn''t sound like a bird call to me. More like a mammal, reminiscent of a woman''s scream (but nothing like a cat''s scream). It started low and rose in scale, lasting about 3 to 4 seconds.<BR><BR>It really caught our attention since we were all on edge from the story I''d told. It caused a bit of nervous laughter and discussion, and some of us decided it must have been some kind of screech owl. (I''ve bought land in that area since then and hear screech owls all the time. They sound nothing like that scream.)<BR><BR>We never heard it again, and by 11 p.m. we were all sacked out. The next morning we got up and decided we had ridgewalked enough. It was Sunday and we had 5 miles of rough terrain to hike before getting to the car, then a long drive home. So we never visited the area from where this sound came. Instead we dropped down off our ridge to the trail following Seneca Creek, and back to my car.<BR><BR>I''ve not been back to that particular spot since, and would never have thought much more about it. But the event has stuck in my mind for fourteen years. When I found the BFRO website this year, read reports about screams in the night, and then noted how many sitings were occuring within a 10 mile radius of this area, I thought it might be worth mentioning. Certainly not a strong report, but possibly more evidence in the growing collection for that region of Pendleton County.",

    " Actually, I didn''t make anything of this experience until I began watching the show on OLN \"Mysterious Encounters\". That''s when the excitement of possibly having an encounter of my own hit me.<BR><BR>I was traveling up a very steep and rocky ridge about 2 hours before daylight one Saturday morning. I was packing a tree stand and my bow. It was mid-october, and daylight would bring the opening day of bow season. I was on a very rugged ridge in Pendleton county; and I had taken several deer in the area in the past. After ascending the first half of my climb, I heard russling up the ridge in front of me. I shined my small mag light in that direction. There, about maybe 60 yards in front of me were about three or four sets of (Yellow) eyes. I noticed the one set of eyes go vertically several feet, still looking in my direction. Keep in mind that our deer are about 3 feet high at the shoulders at best. Plus, the encline was about a 1:1 ratio (or steeper than the nose on most peoples faces). I also noticed that two sets of eyes were very close together, and that one of those sets of eyes didn''t loose contact with me when they run off. I kept anticipating a white tail as they moved off, or at least a snort. This is very common in our deer, even jumped up in the dark. This whole scenerio took maybe about 3 or 4 seconds. <BR><BR>About 15 to 20 seconds after they had moved off, I remember something rather heavy falling near me. I just assumed at the time that it was something falling from an oak tree or something. I now think that it was instead something thrown at me. Another very short time lapse revealed some rather peculiar \"deer vocalizations\". By this time, the creatures of source at moved across a very deep/steep hollow from me. I remember thinking to myself that those sounds couldn''t be coming from a deer or any other wild animal I have ever encountered. That included my hunting travels east and west. That''s when the cold sweat broke out on me when I heard something very similar on the T.V. show.<BR><BR>I would like to add that the area that I was in was in close proximity to where the encounters occurred at Dolly Sods. There is probably about a two thousand feet difference in elevation at where I was at; but it is only a few miles traveling across the Allegheney Mountains. <BR><BR>If these creatures are known to eat white-oak acorns and wild fox grapes, then they would have been in business at that time of year, as they were fairly plentiful in that area.<BR>I also remember the skunky smell where I think they were bedded down. Several emotions come over me now when I think about it and relive it. ",

    " It was in January 2006 when a good friend, my 26-year-old nephew and I went camping on some private land in Stokes County near Pilot Mountain. <BR><BR>This private land operates as a summer camp during the summer and hosts small retreat groups during the fall, winter and spring months. I attended this summer camp for many years as a youth and then lived and worked there during the off-season as an adult. In addition, I have been camping at this very spot a dozen times within the past few years.<BR><BR>In the summertime, the woods at night are alive with the sounds of nocturnal animals, crickets and frogs. During the winter months when all of the leaves have fallen off of the trees, the woods are dead silent at night. The only sounds you can hear are the wind and the occasional dog barking in the distance.<BR><BR>So after we set up camp, we ate dinner and sat around the campfire for a while. We climbed into the tent and went to sleep around midnight. <BR><BR>I drifted off to sleep and was awakened at about 2:30am by my nephew tossing and turning. He told me that he had indigestion from the dinner we ate and he asked if I had any antacids. He asked my friend too and we both indicated that we didnt pack any. He then said that he needed to get up and walk it off. My nephew then proceeded to unzip the tent flap and go outside by the campfire. <BR><BR>By then the fire had died out and I could hear him scratching around in the ashes looking for hot embers and cracking small sticks to build the fire again. Soon, I could see the light of the fire flickering against the side of the tent and hear the crackle and pop of burning wood.<BR><BR>It was at this time that the most unusual sound pierced the silence. <BR><BR>The sound came from the woods immediately surrounding our campsite and it could only be described as a loud yelp.  In all my years spent camping on this land, some in this very spot, I have never heard a sound like this one.<BR><BR>The souund was very similar to the yelp recorded on your website except that it was slightly higher pitch and was much closer. There wasn''t any echo.<BR><BR>Immediately after hearing this sound my eyes shot open and my nephew who was still cracking sticks around the fire froze in silence. My mind was racing to think of what could have made this sound when I heard the tent flap quickly unzip, my nephew tumble inside and then quickly zip the flap back-up again.<BR><BR>The three of us immediately whispered to each other and then lay silent. <BR><BR>The next morning and every time weve been camping since weve always had a good laugh at my nephews expense. After listening to your sound recordings, Im just in total shock at what it could have been.<BR>",

    " dear sirs,<BR>26 years ago myself, a cousin and a friend were getting ready to camp out here in a little town called mocksville nc, about 25 miles from winston salem nc.we were all teenagers enjoying the summer, after we pitched our tent, which was in a field about 200 yards from my friends house, the woods were about 100 yards away from us. As we were starting a fire, we heard something running in the woods, it was heading toward the edge of the woods at an incredible pace, when it was almost through the woods we took off running toward [friend''s] house, we were running down a old motorcycle path, it was running through the knee high weeds, it still almost caught up to us, as we looked back it was standing in the fire throwing the logs out, it was at least 8 foot tall, very hairy, we ran to [friend''s] house and told our story to his mom, now [friend''s] mom had lived on a farm her whole life and wasnt easily scared, she laughed at us, and went outside to get some clothes off the line, a few minutes later she came running in scared to death, she said she had seen something unlike anything she had ever saw, it was huge she said, looked like a monkey of some kind but big, at least 8 foot tall, all that night we could hear it circle the house, it even came onto the porch a couple of times , we were all terrified, to scared to look out, and no phone to call for help, eventually daylight came and it was gone. after we got up we looked at the edge of the woods where it had came out, the branches were broke off up to about 8 feet, after that i read every book on bigfoot. and it made sense, the strong smell of urine, which we smelled before it came out of the woods, and the figure we saw, ive never told this before except to family but it is true and i have no doubt it was bigfoot.",

    " It was a few years ago on a cold, early winter morning.  There was snow on the ground and it was freezing outside.  My mother has a habit of looking out the bathroom window early in the morning.  On this cold winter morning, with the landscaped dressed in a blanket of white and without any visible signs of being touched by human or animal footprints, she saw what looked like 3 very large humanoid footprints. It was so strange that my mother made me get up to take a look.  We put our coats on and went outside to investigate.  We couldn''t believe our eyes.  There in the snow were 3 very, very large humanoid footprints.  We couldn''t figure out where they came from or where they went.  It literally looked as it came from no where and went no where, because the footprints did not leave a trail.  The footprints were so large I could almost stand in it.  You could literally see the 5 toes with foot and toe imprints in the snow.  We couldn''t believe what we were seeing.  Who or what has a foot that big and who or what would be out in this weather barefooted.<BR><BR>",

    " I haven''t told many people about my experience because of alot of non-believers.The year was 1976, I was 15 years old. Snow was on the ground and a couple of friends and myself were snow sledding on my Dads farm. It was around 7:30 that night. We had a fire built at the bottom of the hill. We had just slid down the hill and were making our way back up the hill when we heard something making alot of noise and commotion to the right of us out beyond the light of the fire. We didn''t stay around long enough to see what it was. I ran hard as I could to the house and told my parents about what we had heard. We went back to the hill the next day to see if we could find anything. When we saw the tracks in the snow we knew what was there at the bottom of the hill that night. The tracks were at least 18 inches long and 5 or 6 inches wide. No doubt in my mind what was there that night watching us.The tracks came from out of the woods that were near by and when it left, it went back in the woods the same way that it came. We didn''t actually see the creature that night but we heard it and saw the tracks. That was almost 30 years ago and haven''t seen or heard anything since.",

    " the morning of april, 24, 2007. it was around 330-345 am. i was getting ready for work. after getting dressed, i took the dog out for his morning walk. it was a very still morning, no wind or any other noises to notice. it was unseasonably cool. the dog always has his normal routine, walk out the door, go to the edge of the driveway and use the bathroom. about the time he was making his way toward the end of the driveway he starts growling towards the treeline in front of the house. i was very attentive to him as he had never done this before. i stood there for about a minute trying to see into the darkness of the trees. as i was starting back to the house with the dog by my side. i heard a bone chilling howl and something that sounded like wood being hit on the trees. the sounds were, or it seemed only a matter of feet away. i quickly turned in the direction that i thought the sounds to be coming from and for a moment thought i caught a glimpse of something standing beside a tall tree along the treeline. i stood there for just a minute, but never noticed any more movement. after going back inside, i finished getting ready for work, went outside, as i was walking to my suv i could here twigs breaking from the footsteps. after getting into my vehicle, i put it into reverse and i could have sworn i saw something huge walk around the fenceline, up the adjoining driveway, around a pond that connects the two properties. at lunch when i returned, i noticed what looked like distured leaves on the ground in the area where i had seen and heard the thing. my dog to this day still will not go to the edge of the driveway without me. the howls sounded just like the ohio howl.",

    " This happened around 2014 in the Thickety Creek community of Montgomery County, south of the county seat of Troy. A friend at church asked me if I could come down and check his creek for gold. He knew I liked to do some gold panning as a hobby. We never settled on a day or time, I just told him I would come by one day when I got a chance. I ended up getting off work early one day and decided to run down and wash some rocks. So, I parked at his gate and grabbed my backpack at gear and walked about 200 yards from the road. To my left is the creek with about 4ft banks and a steep mountain to my right. I walked down looking for a place to easily get down into the creek without lots of brush. This area is well known for huge Timber Rattlers. <BR><BR>So I find a spot next to a huge flat rock that I end up using as a work station. After a couple hours of panning I stopped to take a break. I always freeze a 2 liter bottle of water and drink it as it melts. Im standing there drinking the water and I hear something fly through the trees above my head. My first thought was Ive never heard a bird fly through the trees and hit limbs and leaves like that! Why is it doing that? So as I stand there puzzled and confused I hear more commotion coming through the tree tops! This time my eyes focus on the sound and I see a rock about the size of a Jr sized football flying over my head and on the bank on the other side of the creek! As I stand there stunned, racking my brain try to make sense of it, I unsnap my 9mm and shout in that direction You stay over there and Ill stay over here! Needless to say I packed up and left, feeling like Im being watched the whole time! I threw my stuff in the back of my truck and hauled buggy out of there! I dont know of any animal in the woods that can throw a rock that big that far! I was so effected that I gave up gold panning and hunting for the most part! I never told the land owner or anybody else for that matter for a few years. I still dont tell many folks. I feel like I have to keep inside or people will think Im crazy. ",

This past winter I experienced the same strange occurrance on two different occasions in the same spot at a primitive campsite our group had scratched out along the Super Tree Loop in the Woodrun area of the forest.  During the wee hours of the morning in Dec. and once again in Jan. I''ve heard footsteps crunching through the heavy layer of dried leaves on the forest floor.  This \"person\" was buswhwacking and not walking along the trail.  \"It\" also came from the direction of deep woods just behind my tent and not anywhere near the main trail.  Both times it crossed over the trail and continued on bushwacking through the woods in an easterly direction.  I have to admit I was a little nervous about even moving around in my tent because I didn''t want to attract attention.  I laid there frozen both times until the thing was gone and didn''t get a look at it.  Both incidents happened on especially cold nights in Uwharrie (mid to upper teens).  Hunting season was long over as well.  Whatever it was did not use a flashlight and walked through the dense woods of this area smoothly without missing a step.  The last thing I expected to see was a person out there in that weather at that time of the night with no flashlight.  On another occasion in Jan. My co-leader had the exact same experience.  He never looked to see what it was either.  ",

    " it.started about june of 1997 with a loud wistleing at night.i kept trying to figure out what kind of bird or animal was i have never heard anythang like this before.shortly after i started hearing the noises at night i found some strange feces at the edge of the woods about 100 yds or so from my house .i have never seen any like it before. it looked sort of human but i could tell what ever it was it had ben eating leaves and grass. idont remember quite but it was about aug or sept the whistleing stoped.i figured what ever it was had gone. in oct two of my brothers came over and we went squirrel hunting.on the way back to the house we walked close to the area where i saw the feces. one of my went one way and me and my brother made circle came back around and met our other brother.when we got back around to where he was he came running up to us all excited saying did you see that did you see that i said no i didnt see anything. he said it must have ran rite by you. i ask him again. what did he see. he said i dont know it was gray and ijust saw back of this thing. he said it didnt a deer or dog or any animal. after that i didnt think much.but about 1 month later i dont remember the date but it was november 3;oo in the afternoon i looked out the upstairs of my house and mabey a little over 100yds away at about the spot where i saw the feces i saw these two cretures they were gray. they were standing side by side sort of swaying back and forth.i watched for about 10 sec. and then i done someing i souldnt have done i ran down stairs as fast as i could to try and get a better look. when i got out the back door they were gone. its hard to say how tall they were mabey 5 ft mabey 6 ft. they were taller than any 4 legged wild animals that lives around here.that was the last i have or heard from these things. some time after it was all over i remembered something that happened before all this started. i am not sure but i thank it was in the spring of 97 just through the woods a short ways from where the feces was there was an old barbed wire fince. in the top strand of this about 4 ft off the ground was some long gray hair. it was about 4 mabey 5 in of hair on each side of the barb. and i remember thinking at the time what kind of animal around here has hair like this. 1997",

    " It was the first week of December 2002. I was camping with my friend [edited], in Macon County, North Carolina.<BR><BR>We had been there 2 days. We decided to take one of our usual late night walks. Because of the weather we were one of only three sites occupied. There was an icestorm on the way and we were planning to leave early the next morning. We had crossed the river and walked about 200 yards to the gates when we were startled by a scream that made the hair on my neck stand up. <BR><BR>I have spent my entire life in the outdoors, much of it in wilderness areas and I have never heard anything like this in my life.  I was carrying my sidearm and immediately drew it and aimed my maglite in the direction of the scream. The next thing we knew,several rocks were thrown in our direction. TO say we were frightened would be an understatement. We went back to camp and left early the next morning.

    " I was about ten or eleven years old. I was traveling with my mom and younger brother in a car on a rural road near Rocky Mount, N.C. in 1979. It was at night. We spotted a tall hairy figure crossing the road ahead of us. It was close enough to see in the headlights. (I am remembering all of this through a child''s eyes but my mom remembers the same accounts). We slowed down, almost to a complete stop because the figure stopped right in the middle of the road. It turned and looked at us with it''s body still facing in the direction it was originally headed. It was extremely tall, had hair all over it''s body and it''s arms were really long. It suddenly ran with super fast speed and jumped the ditch and was gone. It was like nother I had ever seen before or have seen since. I have been an avid outdoorsman...I hunt and fish and camp all over NC, SC & VA. I have seen bears in their natural invironments. I have seen them stand to look at me and then run away, but they always go back down to all fours to do that. I am convinced that what I saw as a child was in fact, a Bigfoot or sasquatch.<BR>Not only that, but a cousin of mine was driving near the same area in which we saw the Bigfoot about ten years ago. Which would be about twenty years after our sighting. I had never told him of our encounter. He was driving alone and at night and had almost the same sighting that we had had years earlier. He was terrified and when he got home told his mom about it while almost being in tears. She reluctantly told me about it after it happened a few days later, thinking I would laugh at was he had told her. I told her that I completely believed what he had seen!  ",

    " Date: Oct. 2000. Location, lower Sol Duc River, FS Marker D2000, north of Hwy 110. <BR><BR>This event happened during one of my many fishing trips to the Olympic Penninsula.<BR><BR>I traveled this forest service road D2000. This is an off road private forest area owned by Rayonier. I fished the first turn out many times. Often at the first turn out, which is pretty isolated, I would hear big thuds when I would be outside my vehicle working on my fishing setup. It sounded like a huge rock bouncing back and forth, starting slow and then speeding up only to then abruptly stop. If I could describe it, I would say it went, Thud (2 seconds pass), then Thud (two more seconds would pass) then the thuds went quicker. Overall, it was Thud...Thud...Thud.Thud.Thud.Thud.Thud. Then it was silent. I thought it was odd, but I was armed with my Colt .45 and fearless. I was alone as I often was in those days. So that day I decided to go further down the trail, proud of my 4x4 and it''s capabilities I reached the end of the road that had a 4x4 trail that ultimately ended near the river. When I fish I''m stealthy. I''m real silent when I approach the river. So after I parked and walked down to the river I started casting. I fealt kind of odd and frightened and I shrugged it off as just being alone in the woods. <BR><BR>After my second cast I decided to have a cigarette. Dang nicotine! As soon as I used my lighter I heard a large crack in the bushes across the river from me. This was probably a distance of 40 feet. I looked up, startled to see the thick bushes moving alot across the river, but not too worried because I had the river as a safety buffer. It was thick brush and I thought it was an animal sleeping in the bushes. I saw a big brown figure moving in the bushes but I couldn''t make out any details. The bank where the bushes were had a slope above it that was probably a 30 degree angle. This posed an uphill path for the figure in the bushes. Then, the next thing I know I see a tree, in the brush, probably two feet in width (not too big, but not too small)that suddently cracked and fell up the hill! It was apparent that whatever I saw had run into the tree, probably startled by my presence because about 10 feet away from that tree was another tree, that cracked and fell up the hill in the path of the brown creature hastly departing the bushes.<BR><BR>After that, the creature was gone into the deep brush and forest adjacent to the river.<BR><BR>I was convinced this was Bigfoot. Never in my life had I experienced a tree cracking and falling up hill or the sight of something that large that had moved so quickly.<BR><BR>I immediately pulled out my gun and ran back to the truck. I drove very quickly out of the area with my heart racing.<BR>",

Anyway, we got to the spot at about 6:00am still dark, we sat in the truck till it got light enough to see better. We were at the start of the spur truck not running, windows down. We were talkin when I noticed a loud sound on my side of the road, it was stick beating. <BR><BR>There were loud 7 slams in a row. It stoped for maybe 5 seconds  then 7 more from further off in the distance. This went on for aprox 8 minutes. I asked my buddy if he was hearing it and he said yes but he thought it was just a hunter trying to spook up deer. <BR><BR>I don''t think so ...  why would somebody do that back in the woods an hour and a half before daylight? <BR><BR>At one point later on a low bed truck came down the road, most likely to pick logging epuipment. When the truck got closer the driver of the truck stopped, then quickly shined a spotlight in the timber around where we heared the beating. He then took off grabing the gears fast (I know because I drive a log truck too.) <BR><BR>The stickbeating stopped after that. However, when we did hear the beating, they were very hard and heavy bangs. I''m 6''2\" 250 lbs and I tried to make the same sound, to describe to my brother in law what I heard.

    " September 14<BR>My adult son, daughter and her son and I all hiked into Twin Sisters Lakes from the Deep Creek Campground around 1 1/2 to 2 miles. My son and were planning to spend 2 nights and daughter and her son, just for the day. We set up camp, ate lunch and just enjoyed the day at the lake and surrounding area. Many hunters were leaving due to it being the last day of Bow season for Elk so we watched them being packed out by Mules and Horses. <BR>Beautiful day in the low 80''s I would say. My daughter and her son left around 3:30 so it was just my son and I and the 2 dogs. He fly fished and I just relaxed and read at camp.<BR>At dusk we started a fire, ate and had a glass of wine.  I did a couple wood knocks but did not hear a response. Around 9:00 we went to our tents with a dog in each for the night. At 1:30 in the morning the dogs needed out to do their business so we did also then back to bed. My son snores terribly so my sleeping was intermittent. Our tents were between two trees about 8 feet apart and a foot from each other and the trees. I awoke sometime in the night and raised up because I heard the dog moving around. He was staring out the window towards the Lake. He did this several times that night, didn''t bark or growl. I heard nothing that night except my son and the dogs snoring.<BR><BR>September 15<BR>Awoke early and we decided to take a hike to Blankenship Lakes and Meadow. Spooked a Rough Grouse on the way and met 2 Bow Hunters on the trail. They had no luck but said where they were camped at Blankenship was busy with coyotes during the previous night. When we reached the Lake one of the dogs Maggie would not leave Bob''s side so we continued on. Got back to camp around noon.<BR>When dusk arrived we made a fire and I decided to do a call, one loud Whoop and immediately across the lake we got a return whoop and Elk on both sides of the lake started bugling back and forth to each other. Also a coyote yip then it was quiet for awhile and then more Elk bugles and a loud knock on the hill behind our tents.<BR>By this time my son was wide eyed and couldn''t believe what he was hearing. I had told him of all of my expeditions and reports from others so he was a believer but had never experienced it for himself. We decided to go to bed and he immediately went to sleep snoring right away. I on the other hand was awake and listening when I felt something heavy stepping on the side of my tent where my arm was lying , I slowly moved my arm not making a sound because I didn''t want whatever it was to know I wasn''t sleeping. I felt my head being pushed down also as it went by and a loud swoosh on the tent fly. I was petrified and tried to call out \"Go Away\" but nothing came out. I was mute, but continued to try and say something to wake my son up. He and both dogs were snoring. After it passed my tent I continued to hear soft bipedal footfalls around our camp. I did not sleep all night. Around dawn I heard another wood knock. We got up , packed up and left. Very memorable trip for us, shook me up but I still want to have a sighting and will keep doing this.<BR><BR>Note: Actual names edited by the investigator in order to protect the identity and privacy of the witnesses.

    " One morninig after leaving the camp ground in the national forrest to get a biscuit me and my father saw something big walking across the road.<BR>I couldnt identyfi it. it was walking then stoped looked at us real fast and steped off the road into the woods. their was a road sign when this thing walked in front of it it completly blocked out the sign. I asked my dad if he had seen what I had seen and he said yes. Isaid thank god I thought I was going crazy or something. We pulled up to where the thing steped off the road and looked around nothing nothing at all the brush which this thing had went throught was not even moving. we got back in the truck and started driving my dad said what in the world was that. We tried to rule out every other possiblity but big foot but they didnt work out to good. First Isaid it could have been a bear or some one riding a horse. But my dad said if it was a bear it wouldnt be walking upright unlees it was thratened or try ing to reach for food and it wasent presnt,and bears arent around the stanley county area.Then my dad said maybe it was a horse because there are horse riding trailand a horse camp in the national forrest,But theres one problem Something as big as a horse or a bear should have upset the brush and it should have been moving but it wasnt. Some thing very fast and very smart had to have steped over te brush. After all this did only happen in 30 secs while we drove down the road. And Iprety much Agree with my dad. Thanks for your time. Ps I couldnt spell the name of the national forrest its one of those native american words I always have troble with those.",

    " I live on 1010 Highway near the Johnston County Airport. Its kind of a country road , couple swampy areas and such, a good hunting area you could say. I was on my way back from the beach at my dad''s house, my sister was with me. I''m 24 she''s only 15. Anyway, I just turned out of the local BBQ place for some food (White Swan open 24 hrs) to head home. I got past the local livestock building, and turned onto 210 Hwy, drove about 3-4 minutes, turned onto 1010 or Cleveland Rd. There was an old car parked on the side of the road, so I could hardly see to turn left, so when I did, I drove for maybe 10-15 seconds when I saw eyes in front of me (it was about 9:15 in the PM) I turned lights on bright and I thought it was a homeless man walking along the road, but seeing someone walking down here when its dark is unlikey, I slow down ,I didn''t know if it was gonna cross the road , I was driving about 35  in a 45 mph zone. As I got closer I noticed it was not a man, it was something else, like a bear walked up right with long legs and arms longer than a man, had dark hair, I couldn''t really see the color very well. He was about as big as my grandfather and he is 6'' 11'''' . I was speechless, and my sister was scared to death because our house is 1 minute from where he was at. That night I couldn''t sleep and the next morning I got up and went back there, no foot prints or anything because it is so dry here from no rain.I haven''t seen it since but it''s only been a few days ",

I threw my headlights on bright and turned the wheel to the left and drove streight to it. I was sideways in  the road. As I neared it I stopped and I had a clear view of it.  It was so tall that I had to lean closer to the steering wheel to look up into its face.  I could see him (clearly a male) from just above his knees to the top of his head.  I looked streight into his eyes.  He seemed to be comunicating with me though his eyes.  He let me get a good look at him and then he gave a nod and I knew I was to go. He was at least 7ft tall or more with silver and black hair some of it at least 4 to 5 inches long and dark outdoors type skin (where it was exposed. His eyes resembled that of a dogs and were the color of a alaskain husky and wide flat nose and a wide thin mouth like a mans. He never opend his mouth. Just stood there and looked at me and blinked some and make jesters with his head and eyes. When he knodded at me I knew it was time to leave so I turned the steering wheel very slowly ( I felt dazed) and drove on down the road.  I estimated the time I set there about 15 to 20 mnutes.

    " Last  September a friend and I went to scout a place to deerhunt up close to the Pee Dee River.I am disabled from a heavy equipment accident and i needed to kill deer to feed my son and me so we were trying to find a place that i could hunt and be comfortable and not too hard for me to access.We noticed a strong smell and my friend has hunted this place 30 years and i ask him if he had ever smelled anything like it and he said no.Opening day of regular gun season on October I parked my truck at the gate and my friend went by boat to his stand.As I was going in I noticed that stinking smell again as I got to my stand it sounded like something was following me the whole time on the way in there and it sounded like someone hitting trees with baseball bats.I hunted there everyday a lot of times by myself one day going to my stand I saw one just one track about 23 inches long and it was compacted in the ground about 2 inches I weigh 300 lbs. and my track only went down about half an inch. I contacted John Shaw with the N.C Wildlife Resource Commision he a Biologist he came down and met me and i showed him the track he said he could see what i was saying but the track was contaminated so we left it at that. About 2 weeks later i was hunting a stream right down from this spot and heard a huge splash in the water and i thought it was a deer so i waited,but never saw anything about 20 minutes later I went up the creek a few hundred feet and in a place in the creek I saw 1 track again on a rock bottom creek very hard my track didn''t show up when i crossed the creek but this track 20 plus inches was down about an inch into the hard rockbed bottom of the creek since it was only one track again I didn''t bother calling the biologist back,but i saw other signs like stick formations,large patches of vegetation that looked like it had been rolled over by a steam roller,several tracks in the leaves with long strides about 4 feet,found where 2 animals had been killed looked like something put a deer up on a big limb about 8 feet of the ground you coud see the deer hide all over the limb and found where an animal had just been freshly killed one day hunting in there was only person up there that day and something killed an animal near the river it looked like a pile of manure had been steamed rolled into about a four foot wide area on the road about eight feet long and a lot of blood on the ground but no guts and no corpse and that strange smell was there every day.I have hunted a lot of places since i was 5 years old I am 44 now,but this is the only place i have ever hunted that gives me the creeps,I know of a few sighting close to this place,it''s not far from the highway 220 incident yall reported and not too far from where the one in Montgomery county was spotted.I don''t care to be interviewed by the media please but i believe I can show you where you can actually find Bigfoot ",

I followed it with my eyes and as the sun reached in front of my tree stand a small, 3 ft., black, furry creature reared up from a sleeping position and ran away from the sun. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up!!! I don''t know what it was. I have been hunting since I was 15 and have seen plenty of wild life in my time. I had a 30-06 semi-auto rifle and I was frozen stiff. Needless to say, I got the hell out of there and never went back. After all of these years, I now believe it was a \"child\" bigfoot.",

    " I was spending the night at a friends house, after a day''s hunting in the nearby woodlands and swamps. It was about 3:00am in the morning, when I awoke to a ''howling'', or ''wailing'' sound  just outside the house, coming from the direction of the woods. This lasted for probably 30 seconds to a minute. My buddy, sleeping on the floor a few feet away, was not awakened by the sound. I was frightened, so I did not get up to investigate. It took my at least an hour to fall back asleep. <BR><BR>I never associated this sound with ''bigfoot'', until now. I downloaded the \"Howl.wav\" (http://BFRO.net/AVEVID/MJM/ohsket.htm) file from your web site. It has a eerie howling sound, with dogs obviously reacting to the noise. I had chills when I heard this, because it was very similar, if not identical to the sound I had heard that early morning. I have played it over and over again. <BR><BR>I am a hunter and outdoors man, and I had never heard an animal make this sound before. It was definitely ''organic'' in origin. I never thought about Bigfoot living in this part of the state, because the surrounding areas are somewhat populated. There are, however, lots of rural swamp lands and forest areas. <BR><BR>Although I have no further evidence to back up my claims, I thought this would be worthy to report. I''d be interested to know if Bigfoot really could exist in a coastal woodlands area, rather than the mountainous regions that the creature is normally associated with. ",

    " In early October 1983 I was recently married and stationed at Camp Lejeune, NC.  Neither my wife nor I had ever been to Wilmington, NC before so one Saturday we made a day trip to Wilmington.  We saw some sites, did some shopping, had dinner and went to a late movie.<BR><BR>While driving back to Camp Lejuene on US-17, just north of the town of Holly Ridge I noticed a very large figure on the right shoulder ahead.  It was walking upright and I assumed it was a bear. I slowed down in order to avoid hitting it should it go down on all four legs and flee.  I was going perhaps 10 MPH or a bit less when I finally realized that what I was approaching was not a bear.  The creature I saw was massive; maybe 7 to 8 feet tall and I''d estimate 600 Lbs or more.  The hair was a lighter brownish color and appeared long in its length.  I could see its face very clearly.  <BR><BR>What struck me at the time and even to this day is that the creature appeared to be oblivious to his surroundings and seemed deep in thought.  It never gave any indication that he was aware of the car approaching nor did the bright headlights seem to cause it discomfort.  It just kept moving along at a slow pace looking straight ahead.  I finally passed the creature at nearly walking speed.  I assumed I had to have been mistaken or could not have seen what I thought I had so I stopped the car.  I looked back out the rear window and could see the creature still walking southbound in the glow of the stop lamps of the car.<BR><BR>I woke up my wife and had her look.  She did look but said it must have been a bear.  At that point I let it go and resumed my northbound trip back to Jacksonville.<BR><BR>One other thing to note is that my impression was that the creature was clean in the sense that its hair was not matted nor in tuffs.  The hair was straight and laid flat against its body and seemed to vary in length from a couple inches to maybe 5 inches.  There was no hair on the face which was a bit lighter in complexion than the fur surrounding it.",

    " I have never told this to anyone because I didn''t want to hear the jokes, but it was mid July 1987.  I was heading toward the beach in my sports car, top down music blasting.  It was around 8:45 pm so it was still light, sort of dusk dark.  I had my headlights on cruising about 60 mph  when I rounded a corner and there in the road stood this large hairy thing.   I slammed on brakes and swerved around it, but I must have glanced it because it bounced over the passenger side of my car.   I slid the car around and stopped where my headlights were about halfway on the thing.   It got up and came at me.  I was about 25 feet away from the thing and the smell was horrible. It hung in the air like a wet blanket.   It was about 7 to 7.5 feet high, reddishbrown matted looking hair,  its face was hairless and he looked ticked.   I put the car in reverse, backed up and threw the car in drive and took off.  As I was spinning around I looked in the rearview mirror and it was right on my cars rear end.  I heard a loud bang. About that time my car caught traction and took off.  I left the creature running down the road after me.  I have never been so scared in all my life.  After I got to my destination I checked my car.  The passenger rear quarter panel  was dented in with hair on it.  And my rear spoiler was shattered where he had hit the rear of my car.    I told my friends, family, police and insurance that I had hit a stray cow.  But it took weeks to get that smell off of the outside of my car and the inside still had that smell.   It was a under smell, like sewage and something else.  I was 27 then, I''m 38 now.  I have not been down that road since.   I will drive 45 to 50 miles out of my way not to go that route.",

    " I experienced this incident while living on a military base in North Carolina.  I was approximately 14 or 15 years old at the time, I am fifty now, however the incident is still fresh in my mind.  At that time there was nothing for a young boy to do so my favorite pastime was wandering the military reservation and search for discarded C rations as we never had enough to eat in the house.There was 8 people in my family.  One day I had skipped school to go C ration hunting.  I never will forget that day, it was very warm and sunny, which for North Carolina is not unusual for a fall day.  We used to call it indian summer.  I had been wandering the deeper recesses of the reservation and was quite proud of the fact that not only had I stumbled across old farmsteads that the Marine corps had condemed in order to take the land but had a pretty good supply of discarded C rations.  Realizing it was getting late and I had better get home, I hit a tank trail made by the marines for thier vehicles to use.  I was getting closer to home so I decided to leave the trail and short cut it through the woods.  I knew this particular area and always avoided it because it was known as a pocosin, which in local terms meant an area that is real dense and swampy.  As I made my way in to the pocosin something really seemed out of the ordinary, all day I was used to hearing the sounds of the forest, birds, frogs squirrels chattering and what was great not seeing another human being. Now it was so quiet it didn''t seem natural.  Something made me stop and to this very day I am perplexed about this I don''t know why because at that age you have no fear as you think you are going to live forever.  I had no fear this time either however I felt that I was being watched.  I have never had this feeling again.  I slowly started to turn my head to the right when I caught a glimpse of brown.  My first thought was oh its only a deer.  I stood stock still and kept looking at the brown patch and it didnt move.  It was in a VERY dense part of the pocosin and my second thought was maybe its not a deer but possibly a discarded marine corps field jacket.  Now that would be a treasure, as I started to go towards the object I seem to hear the crashing of brush first then that brown patch moved, only it moved higher.  I  estimate a height of between 8 and 10 feet.  As it grew in height it also grew broader exposing more of itself.  I never saw its head or any real features other than the long fur because that thing was moving so fast through that pocosin that I was amazed how any animal that size could do that.  The crashing of the branches and underbrush was loud and I all I could do was stand there.  I don''t know how long I remained in that position, all I rememeber is the sounds of the forest returned and thats what snapped me back to the present.  I have only recalled this story once and was told never again to repeat it to anyone or go back in those woods.  I have never returned to that area.",

    "Around the same time frame I''ve had several occurances at my residence. There were 2 large Forest fires in the area. The first incident was in my garden. I have 2 massive garden areas, a mulch pile and compost piles. My mulch piles were ripped apart. The fish carcasses were gone and the melons had been bitten in half. All his vegetables in the garden were stomped down. I found 2 sets of foot prints; one was very large and its stride was approximately the size of a large man in full splits. The second set was smaller the size of a girls foot print. One week ago my dog; a rat terrier, started growling and its hair was bristled and would not come out of the closet. This happened once before. My dog has chased bears, but whatever was outside scared my dog. Last Wednesday (Aug. 10, 2011) my dog woke me up again growling and in the closet and at that point something bumped against the trailer and shook it. Also the next morning (Aug. 11, 2011) I noticed my 5gal. barrel had been moved from the front of the trailer to the backyard. It had water and shrimp hulls in it. It had been dumped out and the shrimp hulls were gone. Not just turned over, but like some one picked it up and turned it over. This Wednesday (Aug. 71, 2011) at approximately 2:30am I had gotten home from work and stepped out on his porch to smoke a cigarette and heard something howling for about 10 seconds; then stop and start up again. It went from low to high pitch howl. The sound came from the NW direction the same direction I saw the creature on Monday. One more thing; I have several deer, an opossum and raccoons that would visit my yard, but in the last 2 to 3 weeks all the animals have disappeared; especially the deer. No one around his area have seen any deer lately. No road kills; nothing.",

The road was straight for 3 miles, it has forest on one side and swamp land on the other side.  Approximately 5/10ths of a mile South of Harris Road on Highway 53 a bipedal creature bolted in front of my cab less than 50 feet ahead of the cab''s headlights.  The creature was at a dead run and didn''t look towards the cab.  The creature was a crimson rusty brown in color with matted hair, very muscular, 6 1/2 to 7 feet tall and approximately 400lbs.  The arm facing the cab headlights hung knee length or longer, had human hands and black fingernails.  The creature took about 4 strides to cross the highway.  It seemed to have no neck just a head; sort of like a caveman.  Another vehicle was behind me and traveling very fast, but slowed way down when the creature appeared on the road.  That car was approximately 1/10th of a mile behind my cab.  ",

    " I was deer hunting off of Highway 24 near Rhodestown, NC, right outside of Jacksonville, NC. I had been in my stand since about three that afternoon. It was close to dark and I saw a deer walking along the edge of the clearing I was in. It kept looking into the woods like it was curious of something. The deer got closer and I took the shot. When I did, it took off running and hit some brush and fell down. I waited about 30 minutes and it got dark. I got out of my stand and went to get the deer. I got my things together and started dragging my deer to my truck that was about a quarter of a mile through a thick part of the woods I was hunting in. I was carrying my rifle, backpack, the deer, and a flashlight in my mouth. So I could pull the deer by its leg, and hold my rifle and backpack straps. After walking through the thick part of the woods, it was a straight shot to my truck. I dropped the deers leg to get situated and get myself altogether to continue my walk out, when I looked up with my light still in my mouth. I saw two eyes looking back at me. They looked wider than any animal I had ever seen at night. I have been hunting all my life. I have seen everything from deer to coyote to bear. These set of eyes were about my height, I am 5'' 10\". The trail I was on slightly went down hill. It stared at me long enough for me to put my rifle and backpack down. I had a 9mm Glock with me and I pulled it out, I shot once into the ground next to me to get whatever it was to get out of the trail I was on. It did not move or flinch, it just simply looked to its left and looked back at me. I looked down to take a knee, because I was getting worried. I got on my knee, looked back up, and it walked off to it''s left, into some of the thickest woods I have seen. I grabbed the deer and continued dragging it towards my truck. When I got to the spot where I thought I saw the eyes, I looked to both sides of the trail and I could smell a musky foul odor, and where it had walked off the trail, tree limbs and trees were pushed over as if something huge had just barged through the thicket. I went to my truck, cleaned the deer out there in the woods. Like another post on here that I read, I felt like I was watched the whole time I was cleaning the deer. I left the rib cage and spine of the deer I cleaned out there, along with the hide. When I came back to the same spot, the spine had been drug off about 300 yards from where I left it. It was one of the strangest and creepiest nights I have ever had in the woods by myself. ",

    " I have always wanted to tell this story to someone and after reading report #1939 I finally have the nerve to tell it. I live in Carteret county and at the time worked in Sneads Ferry (Onslow County) and the commute to work everyday took me through camp LeJeune via the back gate. As I made the turn onto Hwy. 17 off of Hwy. 172 I noticed what I thought was a bear sitting  down under a huge pecan tree on the right. Since there was about 50 or 60 feet distance between me & \"the bear\" I decided to pull of to the side of the road & watch him for a minute. It was a warm July morning & I had the windows of my truck rolled down as usual and noticed the most ungodly smell I had ever experienced. It was kinda like rotten eggs mixed with sewage & sulfur. As I sat & watched I quickly realized that this was no bear as the creature stood up from the croutched position walked over to the pecan tree & began shaking it.<BR><BR>I was floored by what I was watching. Understand that this tree is immense & the creature had no problem shaking the pecans from it. Pecans that are still in the green hulls by the way. I wanted a better look at it since the whole sighting was with it''s back to me so I put the truck in 1st gear (ready to bug out if need be)  & blowed the horn. It suddenly stopped & just completely froze still with it''s back to me. it stayed like that til I layed down on the horn about 10 seconds later & it slowly turned & looked right at me. Thats when my heart decided to do the 50 yard dash in 2.3 seconds. I couldn''t see it''s face that well but it stood about 8 - 10 ft. Tall & it''s hair was very long & matty. It stared at me for what seemed an eternity & made a loud screaching noise & tore off into the woods. The sprint from the tree to the woods was about 30 yards or so & it took him no time to reach them. I''m talking split seconds!<BR><BR>On my way home that day I decided to stop again and though the creature was gone I could still smell that ungodly mix of stinch. To this day when I pass by that pecan tree my heart races.",

    " The only thing about my sighting Im not 100% sure of is the month. and distances and Heights but I feel Im pretty close.  <BR><BR>On or around July or August of 1992 I was working at a Chinese Restaurant in town. I was supposed to be heading for work, but had made my mind up earlier that I was going to layout. So that I   wouldnt be caught by my Grandparents and or Father for being a slacker I needed a place to hide/something to do. Well not having any money I chose a place that A. gave me cover and B. gave me a place to kick around and explore. Near where we use to live (and still near today) near the Yadkin River they use to hold Tractor pulls, singings (John Anderson sang there once before he made it big) etc. It had gone out of business quite a few years back but there were still some dilapidated buildings still standing and some bleachers. I parked my car underneath the bridges that the interstate ran across and hopped over the DO NOT ENTER signed cable barrier. I followed the dirt path that led to the remains of what was once called The River Run. The path ran parallel to the river, but turned away from it roughly two hundred yards from where I hopped the cable. I reached the Remains and kicked around, I looked in the old Bathrooms (basically a Pee stall) checked under the bleachers for change or dollar bills that may still be there, of course there wasnt any. And little did I know before I got there that a crane they had recently (couple months) been using to dig out sand from the river (for what I do not know) was still there. I of course looked it over, crawled in the cab, looked for keys etc. Well, not only was I getting BORED quickly, it was getting hot. It was a hot summer and having been indoors WORKING, like a good boy the whole summer until then, I hadnt realized how hot it got at around 11:00 am. So I decide that there had to be a better place to chill. I headed back down dirt path. The areas that the Buildings were located were Roughly one hundred and fifty yards away from the river. As I was heading back I noticed something that appeared to be sitting on the riverbank; I first assumed it was a dog. I whistled, yelled here Boy and all that and it didnt respond. As I got closer I realized it wasnt a dog and felt stupid, cause there were weeds and such growing at the bank and I just figured I was Whistling for WEEDS to come to me. As I got closer and closer it appeared to be a very Unkempt, long haired hippy of a man. But the Funny thing was I could only see the Bust of him (chest to top of head) so then I just assumed it was a Bum standing on a ledge in the river looking over the bank watching me. So I kept walking, actually strutting to let this Bum know if he tried to mess with me, he was going to get his ars whipped, but good. As I kept walking and not paying any attention to the Bum a strange sensation came over me (to this day I cant explain it) I looked up and thats when I realized it wasnt a bum, it was something else, what, I do not know but it wasnt human. At this point I was roughly 50 yards away, my mind was racing and my heart was beating, here I was almost face to face with a Big foot? So I did the only rational thing I could think of at the time, I ran towards. I know that, that doesnt seem to be the brightest thing to have done BUT in my mind and with the MILLION things running through it the one thing that didnt go through my mind was fear, NOT one ounce. UntilI was, at this point, roughly forty yards away and the closer I got, the doubts, if any that this THING was not human was completely gone. At about some thirty yards away I took my eye of it for just and I mean JUST a split second and it was gone and that is when fear struck me. I halted quickly. I dare say now I was 25 yards away from where IT was. I was petrified, I stood there for what seemed like hours, while I was standing there it was the first time that I really had the chance to reflect on what I just saw, and all I can remember thinking was. A. Why did it look like Chewbacca from Star Wars minus the black nose? B. Why did it have very light fur almost dirty strawberry blonde? C. Why no smell, dont they always stink? D.Why did I wuss out and get scared? I finally Talked myself out of being a big wimp and decided that if it was what I think it was I need proof. I BABY stepped looking left and right as quickly as my neck could turn the whole time I was walking to the river bank. I reached the River bank and scanned the River and River bank like my life depended on it. I roughly stood there for 15 minutes looking at the Highest point to where IT could have been standing looking over the River bank at me. I looked for tracks but all I found was sand slid into the river, I looked for hair and nothing. I even sniffed around and couldnt smell anything but what smelt like fish. I then jumped to the highest point  to try a gauge how tall IT was. Im 62 and have a reach of 76 and I had to bounce a little (not a hard jump) but bounce nonetheless for the tips of my fingers to be even with the River bank from the highest point IT could have possibly be standing.  I know I had to bounce at least 6 inches(any more and Im sure I would have slid into the water, so that puts the river bank height roughly 8 feet  and I was seeing ITS Bust so IT was (and its a guess) roughly 93 95 or more . I finally climbed out of the riverbank, walked to my car peering and alert to anything jumping out, but nothing eventful happened. Got in my car drove home, no one ever asked me if I laid out of work cause no one EVEN NOTICED!!! Needless to say I never laid out of work again., well not  without a good reason. <BR>",

These tracks were seen within a 2 mile radius in the northern mountains of North Carolina in a town called Glendale Springs, off the Blue Ridge Parkway. They were observed by several individuals including park rangers. Photos were taken by a resident of the town. These tracks seemed to cross over a split rail fence in one stride.

I think that this creature was probably searching for food in the deepest snow in these mountains in several years.<BR>",

    " On Sept. 9th I took my seven year old son trout fishing after school, around 4:00 in the evening. We had fished for probably an hour with no luck at this one big long hole with the front of the hole water moves swift and is 5 to 6 ft. deep. The back of the hole is shallow and slow moving about 15 or 20 ft across. So we decided to fish down to the next pot hole, and as we walked beside the creek I noticed across the creek there is sort of like sand bar where the water has eroded it off to a drop off not like a flat beach. In the sand bar I noticed the sand had been walked in and the sand had fallen of in the creek like an animal had forded the creek their.  On our side of the creek the bank is very very rocky with a lot of big rocks as big as cars and smaller line the creek and the surrounding area . About 15 ft below the sand bar on our side I was walking across some of these big rocks to fish this next hole.When I looked between the rocks and saw one BIG foot print in the wet creek bank sand. I dropped down in  between the rocks to look close at it .I am convinced that is was to wide to be a man or woman''s . I put my boot beside it and I wear a size 10 an a half and this was probably a 15 0r 16 and and about 2 inches wider than my boot. It had undoubtedly crossed the river from the sand bar to this spot. The other side of the creek is rock cliffs an straight up no way to explore any direction.",

    " While on vacation, my family and I were camping at Linville trailer lodge and campground in Linville North Carolina. On June 15th, 2010 we were all sleeping in our pop up camper. At 2:00 am I was woke up by the sound of an animal to the south east of our camper. Its calls were 4 short whoops followed by 1 double whoop. After listening to that for a couple of minutes I heard another one calling from the North West. Its call was 3 short whoops followed by a double whoop. While listening to that one, another from the North West started calling. Its calls were 2 short whoops followed by a double whoop. After a couple of minutes I could hear them calling and moving towards the north east. It sounded like they were with in 100 yards of our camper but I was the only one that got woke up. On June 17th we got ready for bed about 9:00 pm. around 9:30 pm I could hear the same calls as the second and third animals from 2 nights before, they were much further away this time. My 8 yr old daughter heard them also and asked what kind of animal makes that sound? I did not answer her. After we got home I got onto your web sight and played the whoops and knocks from the Sierra Nevada Mountains, my daughter came running from her bed room and said that is what I heard the other day.

    " I was sitting at Popular Crove Church waiting on my girlfriends parents to go to work so I could see her. I started walking up the dirt road then I cut up on Roten Creek Road still walking on a dirt road. When I was walking I had a funny feeling and the hair on my neck and arms stood up. I passed by a local old lady''s house, and saw car lights coming down the road from a distance so I ran down, to my left, and into the corn field. I squatted down and was waiting for the set of lights to come down the road, and as they passed, I saw another set of lights coming down the road, which was my girlfriends parents leaving.<BR><BR>I was still squatting when I smelt a sudden (bad) odor (like mildew). I looked to the left then I looked to the right and I didn''t see anything til I looked directly behind me. At the edge of the mountain where the cornfield began, there Bigfoot stood about 30 to 40 feet away from me.<BR><BR>He was starring at me with big dark eyes. He had an oval pointed head. I''d say about 6-8 foot tall and as wide as a refrigerator. His arms were down beside him. He had big fingers, and hair 4 or 5 inches long all over his body. He had a bow in his back. He just stood there. He didn''t show any teeth or anything. I remember trying to get my legs to start running but it was like I was frozen.<BR><BR>It took me about 10 seconds to start running (NOTE: there was lights coming down the dirt road the whole time all of this was going on but we were both out of sight.) I started running. I ran into a barb wire fence getting to the road, then went running up the road hollering. I told my girlfriend about it and told her not to tell anybody.

On October 18th 2013 around 5:45 pm, I left to meet her and her nephews to take them to a Haunted Trail (For Halloween) after she got off of work.

About 30 seconds after I pulled out of the driveway, onto the road, I looked into an open field on the left, they sell muscadine grapes (there is a dirt road that leads into the vineyard area) and about 30-40 yards off the road, and about 15 yards off of the dirt road/path there what at the time was a bear sitting on its butt, I saw it only for about 4 seconds while passing. I got down the road about 1/8 mile and turned around in a local church parking lot, when I got back, there was another vehicle turned into the dirt path, I slowed down and rolled my windows down, and the lady asked me \"Do you see that thing?\" which I didn''t see it anymore, she then pointed, I looked, and it was walking on two legs into the tree line. We then spoke for a few more minutes, before I left. I told her I turned around to get another look. I knew then it was not a bear after I saw it walking on two legs like a human.

    " I live near Asheville NC. I own a landscaping & Irrigation company. I grew up about an hour east. My parents had 30 acres that was surrounded by 6,000 acres of game land. I''ve played in the woods, hunted, and camped my whole life. Plus my business also allows me to be outside year round. <BR><BR>I was starting up a irrigation system in a large gated & wooded golf community in the mountains of Arden NC basically 15 mins from Asheville. This community joins Pisgah National Forest, approximately 300 square miles of forest. <BR><BR>This was around April or June of 2016. I was standing in the back yard facing the control box which is attached to the house. So my back was to the woods maybe 25 to 30 yards to the tree line. And I hear this large crash. The same sound a large tree makes as it falls through other tree limbs when its falling. I turned quickly to see a massive Beach tree rocking back and forth. Leaves were floating down but no tree was falling. <BR><BR>I''ve been in trees this size. I''m 6''2 250 pounds. There is no way I could make this tree rock like this. But i didn''t see what did it. So watched for probably 30 or 45 seconds. Nothing happened so turned to finish my work. Then it happened again but a different tree. This time I knew something was up. Bears don''t jump from tree to tree like that. So I walked to the edge of the yard and watched for a few minutes. No movement in the trees. The canopy is really thick here. The only way I could have really seen anything that was hiding would have been to walk to the bottom of the tree and look up. But I wasn''t about to do that. So after a while I walked back to the control again but I walked backwards. Seems silly but I felt whatever it was it was watching me. <BR><BR>When I reached the control I turned to face it. Then turned back to the woods again quickly to see if I could trick it or catch it jumping. But nothing happened. So I started working again assuming the show was over. <BR><BR>Then it happened again, a third big tree was rocking after the loud crash. At this point I was freaked out so ran to the truck and left. Rescheduled the job. <BR><BR>I''ve been in the forst my whole life. I''ve never been afraid in the day time. Bears don''t do that. They climb up and down. Cats don''t make loud crashes if they would have they would have run after the first one. What ever did this has to be huge. I couldn''t make those trees rock if i wanted to. Plus it was watching and waiting for the perfect time to jump so I wouldn''t see it. Bears here aren''t that worried about being seen. They know they can''t be hunted in those developments. You have to make them leave. This was something different. I wish I had the balls to walk to the base of the trees. But I don''t. I was afraid. I''ve been training to handle myself. I always carry a gun. But this wasn''t something I could handle. I just know . ",

We had a cat that wasn''t supposed to be in the house, so when he ran inside and hid under our bunk beds I had to go and get him. I bent down to pick him up from under the bed, and as I stood back up, I looked out the window that was right in front of me. As I looked out at the starry sky I was shocked, if not terrified, to see the dark outline of a strange figure walking past the window. <BR><BR>Because of the tree tops, I could only see the top half of the body, but I would estimate it to be at least seven feet tall.

I told my husband that it is a Bigfoot!!! <BR><BR>In a panic I drove away and my husband insisted that we turn around and go back. I was in tears from the fear, but we found an area to turn around and I do so.  As we approached that area, we saw it on the side of the road watching us. He was HUGE!!!! My husband got out of the car to get a better look and he couldn''t believe what we were looking at. It had to be at least 8-9 feet tall, covered in long black hair all over it''s body. It was massive. We were about 100 yards away and nothing was obstructing our view.

    " Shortly after laying down for the night during a backpacking trip in the Nantahala Wilderness, we heard a howl that lasted 10-15 seconds, with a change of tone for the last few seconds. This howl could not have been mistaken for any other animal and sounded very similar to recordings of other howls. In the next 2 hours we both heard random whoops also.  The next day while hiking we came across several very interesting signs along the trail. The first was spotting what looked like a game trail that crossed the hiking trail. Upon closer inspection, the tracks in the well traveled trail clearly were not made by bear or any other four legged animal.  The footprints on the trail had left deep impressions where the heel contacted the ground and footprints much larger than my foot were also seen.  The distance between the tracks was approximately 5 feet on average and the depth of the tracks where the heel had sunk down was 3 plus inches.   The ferns and weeds in the trail that had been pressed down were still green and flat which made me think the tracks had been made within the past couple of days. I followed the trail in both directions for approximately 150 yards and the footprints remained consistent in both directions.  After traveling the hiking trail further down the ridgeline for close to mile I spotted another trail that crossed the hiking trail. The footprints here were identical to what we saw at the first trail. I took pictures to gauge the depth and length of the prints.  I found a stick on this trail that had blood on it.  I regret not keeping it for evidence to see what type of blood it was.  The location of both trails had some similarities: both were located in gaps along the ridgeline and there was an unusually high amount of limbs and trees wedged in tree forks at both sites.  One other strange observation made along the trail was finding 3 large white mushrooms placed upside down near the trails. One of these was on a rock and another was found on the trail while following the footprints.  The area where we found these signs was the direction where we had heard the howl the night before.  <BR>",

    " I am a BFRO investigator in the mountains of Western North Carolina. Having lived in the mountains all of my life, I have enjoyed hunting, hiking and mountain things since I was a boy. So, I am very comfortable with being in the woods and for years have taken late night drives to see wildlife. For the past few years, I have been taking late night drives to my research are on good weather nights. It was Tuesday June 23rd, 2015; the weather was good and I decided to take a late drive to my research area. <BR>I was still on the main road taking my time and within 5 miles of my destination. I was not really thinking about Sasquatch but just enjoying the late night drive and some music.  As I was rounding a slight turn on the road, I saw a coyote on the right side of the road. I slowed slightly as my eyes panned back to the road and I then saw to my left the creature just off the road and behind the guardrail. My trucks side lights hit it just briefly where I could get a good look at it.<BR>My sighting was brief but I did get a good look at it. I could not believe what I saw! I went up the road and turned around as it caught me off guard I did not think to stop.  I was trying to talk myself out of what I saw. \"Could it been something else?\"<BR>The area on the left was very green so I thought I might have seen something else, maybe. As I approached the area I stopped and searched up and down for anything looking reddish/brown in color. Since it was June in the Mtns., everything was very green but nothing was brown at all. Bringing proof to me that it was a creature I saw.  It is very hard to describe the feeling I had at the time of the sighting and after. I was feeling very strange and could not believe what had just happened.<BR>This is what I saw.  Just past the guardrail and slightly off the bank of the road (this bank is very steep) I saw a reddish/brown upright figure. It had it''s back to me and I could see from the back and upper legs behind the guardrail. I am very sure it was on two legs with a most impressive width. The shoulders were very large and the head was slightly forward with a no neck type look.  The waist to shoulders made a very impressive \"V\" shape larger than any man I have ever seen. The hair was slightly long and had another color of gray/white underneath it with a main coat color of reddish/brown. Some of the back hair was shaggy looking. The left shoulder was slightly up and the arm was curled. The sighting was brief but I got a very good look at it. I could tell it was very tall. I did a sketch.<BR>After turning around and checking the sighting area from my truck, I pulled off about 150 yards below on the side of the road.  I got out of my truck to listen for about 10 minutes and then did a \"Howl Call\". I immediately got a response from a pack of coyotes. They were very close and below the road about 150 yards away. (This would be the side of the road the creature was on.) I tried driving back up the road to see anything and about 100 yards above where I saw the creature I saw a Wild Boar feeding on the side of the road. Later on I stopped at an overlook about 1/4 mile past the sighting and made another \"howl call\". I got an immediate response from an owl behind me close to the parking lot. Then just after this response I heard another owl call in the valley below me towards the sighting area. It was the loudest owl call I have ever heard! I have heard many different owl calls but this one was very strange. The volume of it was very strange and loud.<BR>I stayed in the area for 4 more hours with nothing more happening.  The next afternoon me and friend went back to the general area of the sighting and looked for tracks. We could only see disturbances as the ground was very rocky, steep and hard.<BR>I cannot fully explain my feeling after the sighting. I really noticed I was feeling strange when I had gone to get a drink a few miles away in a store. I notice I was sweating and feeling very odd. I think that I was slightly in a state of shock. I feel like this was due to me seeing something I had not seen ever before and something that was hard for me to process. I have been hunting and in the woods all of my life. I have seen every animal in our area in many situations. Trust me, I have never seen anything like this before.<BR>Important footnote:  This sighting happened just within about 6-7 miles from another reported incident that I investigated. BFRO report 49148 happened on June 29th, 2015; 6 days after the sighting I had. I feel like this is more than a coincidence. ",

I turned towards the figure but couldnt see anything. It was entirely too large to be a black bear and definitely wasnt an elk. I havent seen any at all this weekend. The figure was very black.
