There was snow on the ground and it was freezing outside.  My mother has a habit of looking out the bathroom window early in the morning.  On this cold winter morning, with the landscaped dressed in a blanket of white and without any visible signs of being touched by human or animal footprints, she saw what looked like 3 very large humanoid footprints. It was so strange that my mother made me get up to take a look.  We put our coats on and went outside to investigate.  We couldn''t believe our eyes.  There in the snow were 3 very, very large humanoid footprints.  We couldn''t figure out where they came from or where they went.  It literally looked as it came from no where and went no where, because the footprints did not leave a trail.  The footprints were so large I could almost stand in it.  You could literally see the 5 toes with foot and toe imprints in the snow.  We couldn''t believe what we were seeing.  Who or what has a foot that big and who or what would be out in this weather barefooted.<BR><BR>" 1, " April 29 2006 about 630pm I just left the Livingston mall and was heading home but got all turned about since I don''t go up that way very often. Anyhow I was figuring that I was north of rt 78 and just kind of \"Lewis and Clarked\" it toward home via the mirror compass in my car and made the first left southbound that I could once I realized I was heading west and didn''t recognize any landmarks. <BR><BR>I turn down this road and notice some construction equipment not far off into the trees on the right side of the road. I was driving slower than normal being unfarmiliar with the area and since I kept peeking at the compass to make sure I was still southbound (looking back it must have been overcast since I would have just used the location of the sun as a reference to direction).<BR>As I was driving along I caught movement out of the corner of my eye and saw a young deer (judging by size) bolt out of the trees across the road from left to right about 100-200 feet in front of my car. I just took my foot off the gas and didn''t need to brake, then I looked left for followers and saw what appeard to be a hunter in a dark colored ghillie suit burst from the trees after the deer. I couldnt make out any details of the face feet or hands but he/it was only around 6 feet tall or so and I''d estimate the low 200lb range but was unusually fast especially for someone dressed like that. The second thought in my head since I fish and shoot a bit was that it couldn''t possibly be legal to hunt around that area since its fairly close to residential zones. Then I noticed that the hunter had no weapons in his hands. I got up to the spot where they crossed and looked right and noticed that the biped (hunter) actually closed ground on the deer and was still in pursuit. I don''t know if the deer stopped to look back at some point as they some times do but this thing was in a full tilt sprint over what I would assume to be uneven ground and didn''t stumble once. I didn''t hear or smell anything since I had my roof up and AC & radio on at the time.

There was snow on the ground and it was freezing outside.  My mother has a habit of looking out the bathroom window early in the morning.  On this cold winter morning, with the landscaped dressed in a blanket of white and without any visible signs of being touched by human or animal footprints, she saw what looked like 3 very large humanoid footprints. It was so strange that my mother made me get up to take a look.  We put our coats on and went outside to investigate.  We couldn''t believe our eyes.  There in the snow were 3 very, very large humanoid footprints.  We couldn''t figure out where they came from or where they went.  It literally looked as it came from no where and went no where, because the footprints did not leave a trail.  The footprints were so large I could almost stand in it.  You could literally see the 5 toes with foot and toe imprints in the snow.  We couldn''t believe what we were seeing.  Who or what has a foot that big and who or what would be out in this weather barefooted.<BR><BR>" 1, " April 29 2006 about 630pm I just left the Livingston mall and was heading home but got all turned about since I don''t go up that way very often. Anyhow I was figuring that I was north of rt 78 and just kind of \"Lewis and Clarked\" it toward home via the mirror compass in my car and made the first left southbound that I could once I realized I was heading west and didn''t recognize any landmarks. <BR><BR>I turn down this road and notice some construction equipment not far off into the trees on the right side of the road. I was driving slower than normal being unfarmiliar with the area and since I kept peeking at the compass to make sure I was still southbound (looking back it must have been overcast since I would have just used the location of the sun as a reference to direction).<BR>As I was driving along I caught movement out of the corner of my eye and saw a young deer (judging by size) bolt out of the trees across the road from left to right about 100-200 feet in front of my car. I just took my foot off the gas and didn''t need to brake, then I looked left for followers and saw what appeard to be a hunter in a dark colored ghillie suit burst from the trees after the deer. I couldnt make out any details of the face feet or hands but he/it was only around 6 feet tall or so and I''d estimate the low 200lb range but was unusually fast especially for someone dressed like that. The second thought in my head since I fish and shoot a bit was that it couldn''t possibly be legal to hunt around that area since its fairly close to residential zones. Then I noticed that the hunter had no weapons in his hands. I got up to the spot where they crossed and looked right and noticed that the biped (hunter) actually closed ground on the deer and was still in pursuit. I don''t know if the deer stopped to look back at some point as they some times do but this thing was in a full tilt sprint over what I would assume to be uneven ground and didn''t stumble once. I didn''t hear or smell anything since I had my roof up and AC & radio on at the time. All of this happened I would estimate in less than 20 seconds total." 1}, :cardinality 99}, :environment {:data-type "string", :distinct 482, :group-by? true, :commons {nil 15, "wooded area" 3, "Mountain ridge" 2}, :cardinality 96}, :fixed_year {:data-type "string", :distinct 66, :group-by?

Anyway, I found a report from Belchertown, MA and I lived a rural part of Belchertown for several years when I was in college. <BR><BR>This was sometime around 1997-1998 in Belchertown. My housemates and I were out on our porch which faced a 2-3 acre meadow. This open meadow and the porch were on the east side of the house. The entire area past the meadow to the East was wooded with houses and cabins here and there for about a mile until you hit a lake. Behind the house was abput 10-20 yards of woods with a walking trail and then another 10 yards past was a train tracks running East/west then more woods. <BR><BR>Anyway, my housemates and I were out on the porch when we heard the sound of a tree crashing to the ground.  About 19 seconds later while we all were kindve shocked there was an enormously loud and guttural growl/scream/roar.  In all my life I have never heard any animal sound that could match it in intensity, volume, and it just sounded plain angry and vivacious. It is hard to describe just how loud it was and how stunned we all were that this was coming from an animal just inside the tree line.  There were coyotes, owls, foxes galore back there and the sounds they made were a world away in comparison.  <BR><BR>We all immediately looked at each other, got up and went into the house as fast as we could without saying a word. <BR><BR>Everyone assumed it was an animal but after reading about and hearing recordings of presumed Sasquatch scream and howls it brought the memory rushing back because it is so similar to what we heard. <BR><BR>Anyway, just wanted to send this in as I saw there was another report for this area. <BR><BR>Best regards ", :environment "The property was about 7 acres. Most of it a meadow but wooded in front of the street with a small creek near the road. Woods surrounded the entire property and behind the house there was a public trail and a train track running parallel East/west behind the house.
