     {" This was at Davison US Army Airfield, Ft Belvoir Virginia. This was a while back so please hang in there with me.<BR><BR>From late 1977 to Dec 1979 I was assigned to Davison as a Military Policeman. The airfield is not that large and I am pretty sure it''s still an active military installation even now. The airfield is pretty much surrounded by a wooded area and part of the airfield is on a small swamp. When I started working there I was chided by other MP''s to be careful of the so called \"DUSAA Swamp Monster\" it was called. <BR><BR>We had to have a walking 2 man patrol a couple times a night walk the perimeter fence inside the field area. There were countless times while on those walking patrols that I occasionally made, where sounds were heard not only from the swamp area but also the wooded area along the south perimeter fence. By sounds I mean you could hear branches breaking, not small branches mind you, but I mean a VERY LOUD audible CRACK, you''d hear dogs barking in the distance and occasionally some kind of animal - which after hearing recordings on the net of a Squatch - they sounded AWFUL familiar! <BR><BR>Randomly I also had to pull guard at the main gate which is right there on Route 1 - the main entrance to the airfield. I''ve had the crap scared out of me more than I like to think about at that gate at night - you''re there all by yourself in a small wooden gate shack with 1 street light right above you and that''s it. Anyway, to the south in the woods I''ve heard bangs (what you all call knocks) and animal noises, I''ve seen deer running like all hell and jump the fence on to the air field in the middle of the night getting away from something and only 1 time, and it was 1 time way too many, when I saw a deer following the fence at about 2 AM one night and I heard something in the woods, I yelled out and I saw the red reflection of 2 eyes staring at me back from the blackness just inside the trees just out of range of the street light - I still see those eyes when I think about it and it''s been what... 34 years!!!  <BR><BR>One night, about 10pm, or there about, I had a civilian motorist come to the gate off highway 1 and ask me to call the State Police, I asked why and he said this big BIG hairy thing... yup he said thing ... walked across the road in front of him and headed onto Ft Belvoir property and he almost hit it. He thought at first it was a man in a gorilla suit but it was way too tall to be a man. This guy was shaking like hell too. I told him that it''s probably gone by now and the [troopers] probably would not find it. I had heard of other reports by motorists and even the State Police about sightings along Route 1 between DUSAA and Ft Belvoir.  This happened year round, almost any month of the year."

      " This happened tonight.<BR><BR>I had gone outside on the porch to have a cigarette about 9:00 pm and my two German Sherpards went out with me. I was outside about 2 -3 mins. when less then 100 feet from me just at the woods edge I heard a very loud yell/scream.<BR><BR>My two dogs immediately jumped off the porch and took off towards the sound and I ran inside to get a shotgun and light.<BR> The dogs where running around sniffing the ground frantically but staying in the yard and not going into the wood. With my flashlight in one hand and gun in the other I went out into the yard and was looking around for a clue as to what could have made such a weird loud noise.<BR><BR>Even though we live in the country we do have a few houses around us and the only thing that I could come up with is that it had to be some kid messing around and at that time I became mad and yelled \" you might think messing around here playing games is fun but I''ll tell you I have a gun and someone could very well get hurt messing around like this in the dark\". I had barely gotten the words out of my mouth when I would say about 25 yards into the woods came the scream again. <BR><BR>The dogs dashed into the woods and even though they normally obey me very well, all of the yelling would not get them to return to the yard for about 5 mins. <BR><BR>Two things stand out as very odd about what happened tonight. One is that it was right in my yard, granted it was at the edge but it was in the yard none the less. It made such a loud yell as though it wanted me to know that it was there! The other thing I find strange is that the dogs never once barked or growled. You would have to know my dogs to understand how strange that is. They are very protective of the yard. They will bark at a leaf blowing though, and if anyone comes up the drive, watch out! They love to hear themselves bark. They did not bark once, they just kept running around as though they had gone nuts. My wife was in the living room and heard it.  It was loud enough to hear it with the windows closed and the TV on. <BR><BR>I am 45 years old, have hunted and camped a good part of my life, spending a lot of hours outdoors and I have never heard anything even close to what I heard tonight.<BR> "

      " I was a reserve deputy sheriff for Story co. Sheriff''s office. I was employed by Houston International Minerals Corp. at Gold Hill as their on site security supervisor. I had worked the day shift. I had ran some kids out of the old mill at around 3:30pm on 09-15-80. I was showing my swing shift officer the area I had ran the kids off from. We were in the security vehicle parked on the high side of the southside of the old mill (Gold Mining). We saw that the boys, (four of them) were running back down the ravine to the creek below. it was 4:15pm. As the boys reached the creek they must have scared a group of girls at the creek bottom because they started screaming. there was a lot of noise being made by both the girls, and boys laughing, and yelling. At first I thought they had scared a deer west of them near the rock outcrops. Then I thought, no it''s too big to be a deer. I could see it moving amoung the trees heading up the other side of the ravine at a very fast pace. I thought it must be a lone mustang as I watched. My secutity officer got the binoculars from the seat and said \"OH MY GOD\" I looked closer, and realized it was not a mustang. I was looking at a large greying/ brown man shape thing about ten plus feet tall. It was obviously male. because of it''s build. As it cleared the trees near the top of the hill I could clearly see it. It was covered with hair from head to toe. Greying like a person in their fifties. It was at least three feet across at the shoulders. At the crest of the hill it turned to look back down the ravine. It was maybe a hundred yard across the ravine. I had an unobstructed view at this point. It stood on the hill top maybe a minute looking back down the hill, then turned and moved over the other side of the hill out of view. We drove over to where we had seen the thing last (about a two mile drive on dirt roads). It''s was about 4:50 pm by then  We saw no further sign of it, but was able to establish that the thing was standing next to a tree that was 11 feet tall, and it was just as tall as the tree we saw."

At that time the area was deserted my x-father in law owned 20 acres that backed up to TVA which met Duck River on the back. We were walking and suddenly 20yds or less away out of the bush in wide open there he was. We froze and we all stared at each other If he had been violent you wouldn''t hear this story. He turned made an awful growling scream and was gone. Later that day my brother and I went back and searched only to find a 4 inch tree about 6 ft up freshly took and twisted to splinters.  The farm was part of our area and since this sighting we were not scared when so many times we knew he was near, we were never attacked.  Hard for me to write disabled now."

      " Many years ago while camping in Monongahela National Forest in the fall with my family, my son and I decided to walk around part of the lake at night time. It was a beautiful bright night. the temperature was in the 50''s. We came upon a marshy area just off of the trail. <BR><BR>There was a meadow at the edge of the lake. We heard a loud commotion, and sticks breaking. We stopped to look thinking that it may have been campers looking for firewood. I saw two very large black upright creatures ripping branches and bark from the trees. It appeared that they were eating the bark. <BR><BR>My son and I were about 125 feet away at the most. I was so scared and in disbelief, I quietly told my son (he was 10), to move slowly down to the ground. We crouched behind a rock and watched over 15 minutes. I have never sweat like this in my entire life, I was so frightened. <BR><BR>The smallest of the two had a arm reach about 10 to 12 feet. The larger of the two was several feet higher. All of a sudden, the two stepped back into the darkness of the woods and a third one stepped out. This one was unbelievably tall. We only watched a few more seconds and I told my son \"We have to run\". <BR><BR>We ran nonstop back to my family''s camper. My dad did not believe us. He thought it was a bear. I told him that there was no way it was a bear. Even a grizzly was not as tall as the smallest ones arm reach. I grew up in the area and I spent alot of time in the woods and it takes alot to frighten me! <BR><BR>The next day I went to the same spot and found several feet of tree branches and smaller limbs at the base of several trees. The trees had been stripped of branches and bark. Through the years I stopped talking about it because I felt like no one believed me or my son."

     " In the Summer of 1970, I was taking my pony and dog for a walk in the thickly wooded area where my parents had just built a new house. It was at that time a very isolated area.  We had apparently disturbed the wildlife in the area as we were always seeing very large black snakes and other wildlife near the house.  I was not prepared, however, for the creature I encountered in the woods behind our home.  I looked up on the thickly wooded hill and saw a huge creature that resembled a gorilla or a bear.  It was dark in color and appeared to be hairy.  It was on the other side of an old fence from me.  I was very frightened. I fled the area immediately.  I wish I could describe this creature better.  I really don''t think it was a bear.  Bears are not usually sighted in our area and this creature was really big and it startled me because of it''s size.  I don''t frighten easily and was accustomed to living in the country with wild animals.  The one thing that does amaze m e when I look back on this incident is that my dog and  pony had no reaction to this creature.  It makes me wonder if they had become accustomed to it coming around when we weren''t outside.  I never saw it again but a couple of years later my mother saw something from her kitchen window that looked to her somewhat like a bear but she wasn''t sure as she was not close enough to it to see features.  It was on all fours and it got into the nearby stream and walked around the bend and out of sight.  The area where we had these sightings was in Washington Co. MD.  We live near a stream and a thickly wooded area.  The stream feeds into the Conococheague Creek which then feeds into the Potomac River a few miles from our home.  My parents have lived there for 30 years now and there have been no sightings of any creatures such as the ones we observed in the early 1970''s.  However, we were the first to really disturb that woods and the area is now much more developed.",

     " I am reporting this incident from 1991 because I heard of your group on the radio on the way home from work tonight, and you sound credible.<BR><BR>I served as a US Army Infantry Sergeant at Ft.Lewis Wa. for several years, I am also an alpine climber. I went to Mt Adams most of the time because it was much more private than other mountains ie: St Helens, Rainer -- to many people. I also loved the thousands of acres of wilderness area which was restricted to six or eight hearts per group and no vehicles.<BR><BR>Another Sergeant named Jim Avila, my climbing partner, and good friend, and his Golden Retriever pup were there also.<BR><BR>We were only camping and hiking around this trip, since we had the puppy with us, normally we would have camped on a snowfield above the tree line.<BR><BR>Just after nightfall we were talking and the puppy was next to the fire. The sky was crystal clear and everything \"felt\" normal. Since I spent six months out of the year living in the woods, and deserts of the western US and Europe, in the Army, the night is my ally--- I am an expert at what normal feels like.<BR><BR>I needed to urinate, so I stood up and walked to my right rear about 20 feet where a path led down to a stream, I could hear and see the slow moving shallow water in this shallow pea gravel bedded creek, I did my thing and returned to the fire.<BR><BR>We then decided to have some fun and see if we could get a coyote to howl, although we were not sure if any may have been around. We started our best howls to no avail. We continued for about five min. and then stopped. About and hour passed since my previous trip to urinate and I figured I would go again before getting in the sleeping bag.<BR><BR>Jim was across from the fire and could see my walking toward the spot overlooking the path to the creek where I intended to void my bladder, HA HA. <BR><BR>As my feet stopped I could hear footsteps in the dry gravel on the other side of the creek bed about 20'' away. When It heard me stop, it stopped a little to late and I heard it. I felt intelligence in it''s movement, not instinct, it knew it had been busted and just froze. I froze and drew my pistol Jim saw this and at the same time said the puppy flew into the cab of the truck. <BR><BR>Jim, also sensing something wrong, drew his pistol, and stood up. I was looking right where this guy was standing but could not see him because he was across the water but still in front of the opposite bank, he was still frozen like a ROCK. Jim came to back me up he did not know what in the hell was going on and instead of telling him to stop I just kept my eyes glued to the spot I knew the guy was at and he finally decided to move out.He took two strides up the bank away from me with a look over his right shoulder as he was moving away to the right.<BR><BR>His look was concern mixed with a child like fear, as if he really wanted to introduce himself in some way to our \"wolf-calling group\", Also puzzled like \"why are you indiots calling coyotes?----Your Humans, Stupid!\". The most animal like trait was a sort of a very brief mock anger face, which looked like an after-thought just before the big guy went into the woods. <BR><BR>I looked at Jim --- no words --- we threw most of our stuff in the truck and left in a big hurry. There was no way I was staying in those woods that night.<BR><BR>The big guy was huge, but slender as I recall. Don''t ask me how, but I know he was an adolesent. He was sort of like a big kid, but moved like the wind. He saw my eyes and I saw his. I did not tell Jim what I saw, I never did. I never had to.<BR><BR>Please belive me, I swear this account to be true.<BR>Thank You, and God''s Speed in your search.<BR> (non-numeric average)",

   " Hello!<BR><BR>This is something that happened a long time ago and to be honest I never thought it could be connected to Sasquatch/Bigfoot but recently Ive been reading about the topic a lot and I figured Id send it to you guys after finding your site and just checking out reports from areas where Ive lived in the past. Anyway, I found a report from Belchertown, MA and I lived a rural part of Belchertown for several years when I was in college. <BR><BR>This was sometime around 1997-1998 in Belchertown. My housemates and I were out on our porch which faced a 2-3 acre meadow. This open meadow and the porch were on the east side of the house. The entire area past the meadow to the East was wooded with houses and cabins here and there for about a mile until you hit a lake. Behind the house was abput 10-20 yards of woods with a walking trail and then another 10 yards past was a train tracks running East/west then more woods. <BR><BR>Anyway, my housemates and I were out on the porch when we heard the sound of a tree crashing to the ground.  About 19 seconds later while we all were kindve shocked there was an enormously loud and guttural growl/scream/roar.  In all my life I have never heard any animal sound that could match it in intensity, volume, and it just sounded plain angry and vivacious. It is hard to describe just how loud it was and how stunned we all were that this was coming from an animal just inside the tree line.  There were coyotes, owls, foxes galore back there and the sounds they made were a world away in comparison.  <BR><BR>We all immediately looked at each other, got up and went into the house as fast as we could without saying a word. <BR><BR>Everyone assumed it was an animal but after reading about and hearing recordings of presumed Sasquatch scream and howls it brought the memory rushing back because it is so similar to what we heard. <BR><BR>Anyway, just wanted to send this in as I saw there was another report for this area. <BR><BR>Best regards ",
   :environment
   "The property was about 7 acres. Most of it a meadow but wooded in front of the street with a small creek near the road. Woods surrounded the entire property and behind the house there was a public trail and a train track running parallel East/west behind the house. To the east of the 2-3 acre was a wooded area filled with many large Birch trees. The houses in this area are mostly in the woods.",
