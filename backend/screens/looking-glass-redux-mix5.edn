Intricate Celtic-inspired tattoos of rabbits and wilderness designs grace her neck, collarbone, and shoulder areas, enhancing her enchanting visage. Fantasy-like blue and pink lights from the forest glimmers against her curvaceous figure, amplifying her radiant beauty. She has a lush and curvy figure, and her culturally-inspired attire includes a ribbon choker and a long necklace which adds a sprinkle of glamour to her style. Playful yet sophisticated, she leans against a wall, offering the viewer a teasing, engaging glance."}},

A highly detailed, exaggerated pinup style illustration, featuring a young, powerful, and robust Scandinavian woman in her early 30s. She sports a full-face and long, flowing dark hair, buxom pinup build. The setting is in the picturesque wilderness of Cape Code America, under the teal and pink hues of a Cyberpunk-Vaporwave dusk. She stares confidently at the viewer, her allure intensified by dramatic lighting and dark makeup. A sly, playful smile dances on her lips, contributing to a mystical and alluring aura. Intricate and ornate tattoos adorn her shoulders, collarbone, and gracefully ascend to her neck, each one representing a unique story. She is seen with a rabbit pendant around her neck, and similar rabbit motifs are subtly integrated within her tattoos. The image beautifully juxtaposes the elements of wonder, mystery, and temptation in a radiant sunrise.   "}]]]},

Position at the heart of this landscape, a late 20s buxom Caucasian woman with beautifully flowing hair. Identify her with full, pouty lips and a nose that gently upturns. Her visage can be seen as a blend of delight and enchantment, while the sight of intricate Celtic-styled tattoos of rabbits and wilderness adorn her neck, collarbone, and shoulders. She possesses a magical and busty overflowing physique. Bask her in the mysterious, abstract glows of blue and pink that enhance her robust and curvaceous symmetry, buxom, burlesque, augmenting the glow of her skin. Her dark makeup a contrast to her pale skin. Complete her attire with a choker ribbon and an extended necklace as she leans against a wall, providing the observer with an alluringly playful glance."}]]]},

Centralize around a charming woman in her late twenties of Caucasian descent, with beautifully flowing hair. Detail her facial features to have full, pouty lips, and an upturned nose, reflecting a mix of delight and enchantment. Embellish her neck, collarbone, and shoulders with intricate Celtic-styled tattoos featuring rabbits and wilderness. Her physique can best be described as mystical and curvaceous. Illuminate her in abstract blue and pink lights that emphasize her form. Contrast her pale skin with dark makeup. Adorn her with a choker ribbon and a long necklace as she leans against a wall, offering an enticingly playful gaze. The scene delivers an intense feeling of a cyberpunk environment in a heavily stylized and exaggerated pinup style   "}]]]},

The painting should portray a well-built and toned, yet curvaceous Caucasian woman in her late 20s, posing as a persona based on the Statue of Liberty. She should have refined facial features, with a slightly upturned nose, and a slim yet hourglass figure. She should be holding an AR-15 rifle and standing majestically at a harbor in a scene reminiscent of American New England with boats, flags and cheering crowds, each holding their own rifles. The picture should capture her establishing eye contact with the viewer, her confidence and charm accentuated by the dramatic neon lighting that resonates with a Cyberpunk-Vaporwave aesthetic.
