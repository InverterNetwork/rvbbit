     {" My story of Bigfoot was not visual but rather we heard a scream in the deep forest that we could not explain.  <BR><BR>The location was in the area of Mono Hot Springs, in the Sierra Nevada''s in California, specifically, the John Muir Wilderness.  <BR><BR>My brother friend and I were fishing at Doris Lake near dusk.  Doris Lake is roughly a mile and a half hike from the resort of Mono.  Nothing unusual was happening and then out of nowhere, we heard a scream come from across the lake and up in the Mountians.  There were no people or animals that we could see anywhere.  We were in the proverbial wilderness.  My brother and I looked at each other, and unable to readily discern what we were hearing we continued to fish.  I did say to him, if I hear that again I am out of here. Well, a minute or so later, the same scream.  The three of us immediately reeled in and began to run all the way back to the resort, without stopping.  <BR><BR>I have listened to various recordings of alleged Bigfoot, and I am struck by how similar these recordings are to the scream that we heard.  I did not see anything, so I cant be sure, but I am fairly certian what I heard was not a human, bear or mountian lion.  So....what could it be?<BR><BR>Note:  my brother and sister worked for several years at Mono Hot Springs.  My sisters good friend who worked their as well had a horse which she kept in the summer time at the springs. While riding in the back country, she claims to have seen Bigfoot walking through a meadow below a bluff she was riding atop.    "

It was a large man-sized creature on two legs striding very fast (long strides), then it ran very fast and jumped off an embankment. It was very heavy, a lot of dust was in the air when I passed the spot where he jumped off the embankment (where he jumped off was about twenty feet from the road).

     " It was a typical winter afternoon in Humbolt County, it was raining intermitantly and the river was on the rise and becoming too turbid to fish.  But, I wanted to catch another steele before the river blew out so, I drove down to the river bar as described in the \"Where did it occur?\" section of this report.  <BR><BR>I parked about 30 yards away from the rivers edge, on a dirt road surrounded by dense willows.  I turned off the car and opened the door.  Immediatly I heard two bellows that seemed far off.  I initially thought it was local kids.  The best I can do to discribe the noise is to ask you to try and make it--- put your lips togeather as if to make the sound of a \"B\" then bellow \"Whoooooooop\", wait two seconds and do it again. This is what I heard.  <BR><BR>To this day I can physically emulate the soud. The sound was similar to the bugle of a bull elk.  I used to work as a horse patrol park ranger on the eastern slope of the Rockies in Rocky Mountain National Park, I kept visitors away from the elk.  In addition, I have frequently heard elk bugle near Oric, CA. I know the bugle of an elk.  That''s not what this was.  <BR><BR>Well, I didn''t think much of it so I got my wadders on and proceeded to the rivers edge.  I wadded in up to my thigh and began fishing moving slowly down stream.  The river was probably about fifty yards wide and nearly at bank full about ten minutes went by and I noticed a dark figure down stream an accross the river, seemingly standing behind a large root wad.  I could see what I though was a head and shoulders of a bear or something? It was drizzeling and I couldn''t focus on it at first, I wasn''t sure it was an animal I thought it might just be part of the root wad.  <BR><BR>As I fished down stream I worked my way dirrectly accross from it and looked at it again, I looked right into its eyes, they were dark, it didn''t move. I then saw another to its left, I could see its body from <BR>the thigh up, it didn''t move, it was looking slightly down stream and I couldn''t see its eyes.  <BR><BR>These things looked taller than a man, had flat faces and large round eyes, their shoulders were broad and their arms were long, they were mostly covered in hair although the one on the left seemed to have bald spots on its chest area, like mange.  They stood still, never once moved.  Ikept fising and tried to work down stream of them to a tailout wher I could cross and sneek up on them to get a closer look, the river was to high.  <BR><BR>As I worked back upstream I noticed a cacoon shaped object perched on the root wad overhanging the rivers edge.  It was shaped like a foot ball but was probably 4 feet long and 21/2 feet in diameter (hard to tell at 50 yards).  This cacoon like thing appeared to be neetly wrapped in dry grasses like cat tail or pampas grass blades.  I kept fishing moving upstream of them back toward my car, at one point I looked back to get another look anfd the cacoon like thing and the animals were gone.  A day later I drove to the other side of the river to go see if I could track um but the river had flooded the entire area.  <BR><BR>I don''t follow Big Foot stuff, but I do know no bones have ever been found.  As a scintist this encounter has stimulated me to develope a theory.. I theorize that they warn eachother with this BWhooooop sound, and that the reason we have never found their bones is that they cleverly dispose of them by waiting till the rivers are on the rise, packaging the bones, and putting them in the rivers close to their mouths so that they wash out to sea.  I''m not sure I belive in any of this but thats what I saw and heard and thats my theory.  My second theory is that it was an elaborate hoax preformed by somm sort of Big Foot fan club or somthing.  But why would some one do that on an empty river bar I was the only one there and no one knew I was going to be there.<BR><BR>   ",

Myself and a frind were fourwheeling on light, snow covered roads at about two am. we came around a corner and we both saw something run across the road.  it had very long, shagy red hair and it was running on all fours.  something like a gorilla would when charging.  we only observed it cross the road when we apperently spooked it.  we are both outdoorsman and have seen bears and the like befor.  when it happened, we both simultaneously looked at each other said \"what the hell was that?\" and then said \"we better not tell anyone or they''ll think were crazy!\"  I can''t swear to what it was, but I''ll swear it wasn''t a bear.  this thing was the wrong color to be any kind of cat and it was to thin through the torso as compared to its overall size to be a bear and i suspect bears would have already been in hybernation.  the hair looked like it could have been 18 inches long, very shagy.  its body shape was like a giant human, not a cat or bear.  unfortunately the animal never turned its face toward us at all.

     {" My story of Bigfoot was not visual but rather we heard a scream in the deep forest that we could not explain.  <BR><BR>The location was in the area of Mono Hot Springs, in the Sierra Nevada''s in California, specifically, the John Muir Wilderness.  <BR><BR>My brother friend and I were fishing at Doris Lake near dusk.  Doris Lake is roughly a mile and a half hike from the resort of Mono.  Nothing unusual was happening and then out of nowhere, we heard a scream come from across the lake and up in the Mountians.  There were no people or animals that we could see anywhere.  We were in the proverbial wilderness.  My brother and I looked at each other, and unable to readily discern what we were hearing we continued to fish.  I did say to him, if I hear that again I am out of here. Well, a minute or so later, the same scream.  The three of us immediately reeled in and began to run all the way back to the resort, without stopping.  <BR><BR>I have listened to various recordings of alleged Bigfoot, and I am struck by how similar these recordings are to the scream that we heard.  I did not see anything, so I cant be sure, but I am fairly certian what I heard was not a human, bear or mountian lion.  So....what could it be?<BR><BR>Note:  my brother and sister worked for several years at Mono Hot Springs.  My sisters good friend who worked their as well had a horse which she kept in the summer time at the springs. While riding in the back country, she claims to have seen Bigfoot walking through a meadow below a bluff she was riding atop.    "

It was a large man-sized creature on two legs striding very fast (long strides), then it ran very fast and jumped off an embankment. It was very heavy, a lot of dust was in the air when I passed the spot where he jumped off the embankment (where he jumped off was about twenty feet from the road).

     " It was a typical winter afternoon in Humbolt County, it was raining intermitantly and the river was on the rise and becoming too turbid to fish.  But, I wanted to catch another steele before the river blew out so, I drove down to the river bar as described in the \"Where did it occur?\" section of this report.  <BR><BR>I parked about 30 yards away from the rivers edge, on a dirt road surrounded by dense willows.  I turned off the car and opened the door.  Immediatly I heard two bellows that seemed far off.  I initially thought it was local kids.  The best I can do to discribe the noise is to ask you to try and make it--- put your lips togeather as if to make the sound of a \"B\" then bellow \"Whoooooooop\", wait two seconds and do it again. This is what I heard.  <BR><BR>To this day I can physically emulate the soud. The sound was similar to the bugle of a bull elk.  I used to work as a horse patrol park ranger on the eastern slope of the Rockies in Rocky Mountain National Park, I kept visitors away from the elk.  In addition, I have frequently heard elk bugle near Oric, CA. I know the bugle of an elk.  That''s not what this was.  <BR><BR>Well, I didn''t think much of it so I got my wadders on and proceeded to the rivers edge.  I wadded in up to my thigh and began fishing moving slowly down stream.  The river was probably about fifty yards wide and nearly at bank full about ten minutes went by and I noticed a dark figure down stream an accross the river, seemingly standing behind a large root wad.  I could see what I though was a head and shoulders of a bear or something? It was drizzeling and I couldn''t focus on it at first, I wasn''t sure it was an animal I thought it might just be part of the root wad.  <BR><BR>As I fished down stream I worked my way dirrectly accross from it and looked at it again, I looked right into its eyes, they were dark, it didn''t move. I then saw another to its left, I could see its body from <BR>the thigh up, it didn''t move, it was looking slightly down stream and I couldn''t see its eyes.  <BR><BR>These things looked taller than a man, had flat faces and large round eyes, their shoulders were broad and their arms were long, they were mostly covered in hair although the one on the left seemed to have bald spots on its chest area, like mange.  They stood still, never once moved.  Ikept fising and tried to work down stream of them to a tailout wher I could cross and sneek up on them to get a closer look, the river was to high.  <BR><BR>As I worked back upstream I noticed a cacoon shaped object perched on the root wad overhanging the rivers edge.  It was shaped like a foot ball but was probably 4 feet long and 21/2 feet in diameter (hard to tell at 50 yards).  This cacoon like thing appeared to be neetly wrapped in dry grasses like cat tail or pampas grass blades.  I kept fishing moving upstream of them back toward my car, at one point I looked back to get another look anfd the cacoon like thing and the animals were gone.  A day later I drove to the other side of the river to go see if I could track um but the river had flooded the entire area.  <BR><BR>I don''t follow Big Foot stuff, but I do know no bones have ever been found.  As a scintist this encounter has stimulated me to develope a theory.. I theorize that they warn eachother with this BWhooooop sound, and that the reason we have never found their bones is that they cleverly dispose of them by waiting till the rivers are on the rise, packaging the bones, and putting them in the rivers close to their mouths so that they wash out to sea.  I''m not sure I belive in any of this but thats what I saw and heard and thats my theory.  My second theory is that it was an elaborate hoax preformed by somm sort of Big Foot fan club or somthing.  But why would some one do that on an empty river bar I was the only one there and no one knew I was going to be there.<BR><BR>   ",

Myself and a frind were fourwheeling on light, snow covered roads at about two am. we came around a corner and we both saw something run across the road.  it had very long, shagy red hair and it was running on all fours.  something like a gorilla would when charging.  we only observed it cross the road when we apperently spooked it.  we are both outdoorsman and have seen bears and the like befor.  when it happened, we both simultaneously looked at each other said \"what the hell was that?\" and then said \"we better not tell anyone or they''ll think were crazy!\"  I can''t swear to what it was, but I''ll swear it wasn''t a bear.  this thing was the wrong color to be any kind of cat and it was to thin through the torso as compared to its overall size to be a bear and i suspect bears would have already been in hybernation.  the hair looked like it could have been 18 inches long, very shagy.  its body shape was like a giant human, not a cat or bear.  unfortunately the animal never turned its face toward us at all.

     {" My story of Bigfoot was not visual but rather we heard a scream in the deep forest that we could not explain.  <BR><BR>The location was in the area of Mono Hot Springs, in the Sierra Nevada''s in California, specifically, the John Muir Wilderness.  <BR><BR>My brother friend and I were fishing at Doris Lake near dusk.  Doris Lake is roughly a mile and a half hike from the resort of Mono.  Nothing unusual was happening and then out of nowhere, we heard a scream come from across the lake and up in the Mountians.  There were no people or animals that we could see anywhere.  We were in the proverbial wilderness.  My brother and I looked at each other, and unable to readily discern what we were hearing we continued to fish.  I did say to him, if I hear that again I am out of here. Well, a minute or so later, the same scream.  The three of us immediately reeled in and began to run all the way back to the resort, without stopping.  <BR><BR>I have listened to various recordings of alleged Bigfoot, and I am struck by how similar these recordings are to the scream that we heard.  I did not see anything, so I cant be sure, but I am fairly certian what I heard was not a human, bear or mountian lion.  So....what could it be?<BR><BR>Note:  my brother and sister worked for several years at Mono Hot Springs.  My sisters good friend who worked their as well had a horse which she kept in the summer time at the springs. While riding in the back country, she claims to have seen Bigfoot walking through a meadow below a bluff she was riding atop.    "

      " I didn''t get out of my car. I didn''t have my camera with me. I noticed a movement on the right of my car ahead of me. It was a large man-sized creature on two legs striding very fast (long strides), then it ran very fast and jumped off an embankment. It was very heavy, a lot of dust was in the air when I passed the spot where he jumped off the embankment (where he jumped off was about twenty feet from the road). The creature looked brown and gold in the setting sun."

The next day we went out to the same location and noticed several trees had been broken and where blocking the road.  We examined the branchs and they were not cut, but physically broken.  They had to be at least 3-4 inches wide.  We didn''t think anything of it, but we did get a wiff of a bad odor.  If I can find a map of the location, I can give you an exact location."

     " It was a typical winter afternoon in Humbolt County, it was raining intermitantly and the river was on the rise and becoming too turbid to fish.  But, I wanted to catch another steele before the river blew out so, I drove down to the river bar as described in the \"Where did it occur?\" section of this report.  <BR><BR>I parked about 30 yards away from the rivers edge, on a dirt road surrounded by dense willows.  I turned off the car and opened the door.  Immediatly I heard two bellows that seemed far off.  I initially thought it was local kids.  The best I can do to discribe the noise is to ask you to try and make it--- put your lips togeather as if to make the sound of a \"B\" then bellow \"Whoooooooop\", wait two seconds and do it again. This is what I heard.  <BR><BR>To this day I can physically emulate the soud. The sound was similar to the bugle of a bull elk.  I used to work as a horse patrol park ranger on the eastern slope of the Rockies in Rocky Mountain National Park, I kept visitors away from the elk.  In addition, I have frequently heard elk bugle near Oric, CA. I know the bugle of an elk.  That''s not what this was.  <BR><BR>Well, I didn''t think much of it so I got my wadders on and proceeded to the rivers edge.  I wadded in up to my thigh and began fishing moving slowly down stream.  The river was probably about fifty yards wide and nearly at bank full about ten minutes went by and I noticed a dark figure down stream an accross the river, seemingly standing behind a large root wad.  I could see what I though was a head and shoulders of a bear or something? It was drizzeling and I couldn''t focus on it at first, I wasn''t sure it was an animal I thought it might just be part of the root wad.  <BR><BR>As I fished down stream I worked my way dirrectly accross from it and looked at it again, I looked right into its eyes, they were dark, it didn''t move. I then saw another to its left, I could see its body from <BR>the thigh up, it didn''t move, it was looking slightly down stream and I couldn''t see its eyes.  <BR><BR>These things looked taller than a man, had flat faces and large round eyes, their shoulders were broad and their arms were long, they were mostly covered in hair although the one on the left seemed to have bald spots on its chest area, like mange.  They stood still, never once moved.  Ikept fising and tried to work down stream of them to a tailout wher I could cross and sneek up on them to get a closer look, the river was to high.  <BR><BR>As I worked back upstream I noticed a cacoon shaped object perched on the root wad overhanging the rivers edge.  It was shaped like a foot ball but was probably 4 feet long and 21/2 feet in diameter (hard to tell at 50 yards).  This cacoon like thing appeared to be neetly wrapped in dry grasses like cat tail or pampas grass blades.  I kept fishing moving upstream of them back toward my car, at one point I looked back to get another look anfd the cacoon like thing and the animals were gone.  A day later I drove to the other side of the river to go see if I could track um but the river had flooded the entire area.  <BR><BR>I don''t follow Big Foot stuff, but I do know no bones have ever been found.  As a scintist this encounter has stimulated me to develope a theory.. I theorize that they warn eachother with this BWhooooop sound, and that the reason we have never found their bones is that they cleverly dispose of them by waiting till the rivers are on the rise, packaging the bones, and putting them in the rivers close to their mouths so that they wash out to sea.  I''m not sure I belive in any of this but thats what I saw and heard and thats my theory.  My second theory is that it was an elaborate hoax preformed by somm sort of Big Foot fan club or somthing.  But why would some one do that on an empty river bar I was the only one there and no one knew I was going to be there.<BR><BR>   ",

     " this report is for my daughter who today thinks she saw two big creatures that looked like the  creature called bigfoot. She was pretty shook up about it.  She was so scared that she did not stop. She said the creatures were walking in a pond between Orick and Trinadad off of hwy. 101 this morning about 10:30. She said they were very close. She saw the big ones face. She said it looked like a monkey face. The other one was stooped over so she could not see him very good.<BR>",

     " I was sitting here listening to you on coast to coast and thought I''d tell you about an insident that happened in dec of 97.  the location was in the sierra navada mountains about ten miles above huntington lake which is about 60 miles above fresno in central CA.  Myself and a frind were fourwheeling on light, snow covered roads at about two am. we came around a corner and we both saw something run across the road.  it had very long, shagy red hair and it was running on all fours.  something like a gorilla would when charging.  we only observed it cross the road when we apperently spooked it.  we are both outdoorsman and have seen bears and the like befor.  when it happened, we both simultaneously looked at each other said \"what the hell was that?\" and then said \"we better not tell anyone or they''ll think were crazy!\"  I can''t swear to what it was, but I''ll swear it wasn''t a bear.  this thing was the wrong color to be any kind of cat and it was to thin through the torso as compared to its overall size to be a bear and i suspect bears would have already been in hybernation.  the hair looked like it could have been 18 inches long, very shagy.  its body shape was like a giant human, not a cat or bear.  unfortunately the animal never turned its face toward us at all.

     {" My story of Bigfoot was not visual but rather we heard a scream in the deep forest that we could not explain.  <BR><BR>The location was in the area of Mono Hot Springs, in the Sierra Nevada''s in California, specifically, the John Muir Wilderness.  <BR><BR>My brother friend and I were fishing at Doris Lake near dusk.  Doris Lake is roughly a mile and a half hike from the resort of Mono.  Nothing unusual was happening and then out of nowhere, we heard a scream come from across the lake and up in the Mountians.  There were no people or animals that we could see anywhere.  We were in the proverbial wilderness.  My brother and I looked at each other, and unable to readily discern what we were hearing we continued to fish.  I did say to him, if I hear that again I am out of here. Well, a minute or so later, the same scream.  The three of us immediately reeled in and began to run all the way back to the resort, without stopping.  <BR><BR>I have listened to various recordings of alleged Bigfoot, and I am struck by how similar these recordings are to the scream that we heard.  I did not see anything, so I cant be sure, but I am fairly certian what I heard was not a human, bear or mountian lion.  So....what could it be?<BR><BR>Note:  my brother and sister worked for several years at Mono Hot Springs.  My sisters good friend who worked their as well had a horse which she kept in the summer time at the springs. While riding in the back country, she claims to have seen Bigfoot walking through a meadow below a bluff she was riding atop.    "

      " I didn''t get out of my car. I didn''t have my camera with me. I noticed a movement on the right of my car ahead of me. It was a large man-sized creature on two legs striding very fast (long strides), then it ran very fast and jumped off an embankment. It was very heavy, a lot of dust was in the air when I passed the spot where he jumped off the embankment (where he jumped off was about twenty feet from the road). The creature looked brown and gold in the setting sun."

      " My friend and I went target shooting one day in the hills east of Arcata Ca in the Spring of 94.  The next day we went out to the same location and noticed several trees had been broken and where blocking the road.  We examined the branchs and they were not cut, but physically broken.  They had to be at least 3-4 inches wide.  We didn''t think anything of it, but we did get a wiff of a bad odor.  If I can find a map of the location, I can give you an exact location."

     " It was a typical winter afternoon in Humbolt County, it was raining intermitantly and the river was on the rise and becoming too turbid to fish.  But, I wanted to catch another steele before the river blew out so, I drove down to the river bar as described in the \"Where did it occur?\" section of this report.  <BR><BR>I parked about 30 yards away from the rivers edge, on a dirt road surrounded by dense willows.  I turned off the car and opened the door.  Immediatly I heard two bellows that seemed far off.  I initially thought it was local kids.  The best I can do to discribe the noise is to ask you to try and make it--- put your lips togeather as if to make the sound of a \"B\" then bellow \"Whoooooooop\", wait two seconds and do it again. This is what I heard.  <BR><BR>To this day I can physically emulate the soud. The sound was similar to the bugle of a bull elk.  I used to work as a horse patrol park ranger on the eastern slope of the Rockies in Rocky Mountain National Park, I kept visitors away from the elk.  In addition, I have frequently heard elk bugle near Oric, CA. I know the bugle of an elk.  That''s not what this was.  <BR><BR>Well, I didn''t think much of it so I got my wadders on and proceeded to the rivers edge.  I wadded in up to my thigh and began fishing moving slowly down stream.  The river was probably about fifty yards wide and nearly at bank full about ten minutes went by and I noticed a dark figure down stream an accross the river, seemingly standing behind a large root wad.  I could see what I though was a head and shoulders of a bear or something? It was drizzeling and I couldn''t focus on it at first, I wasn''t sure it was an animal I thought it might just be part of the root wad.  <BR><BR>As I fished down stream I worked my way dirrectly accross from it and looked at it again, I looked right into its eyes, they were dark, it didn''t move. I then saw another to its left, I could see its body from <BR>the thigh up, it didn''t move, it was looking slightly down stream and I couldn''t see its eyes.  <BR><BR>These things looked taller than a man, had flat faces and large round eyes, their shoulders were broad and their arms were long, they were mostly covered in hair although the one on the left seemed to have bald spots on its chest area, like mange.  They stood still, never once moved.  Ikept fising and tried to work down stream of them to a tailout wher I could cross and sneek up on them to get a closer look, the river was to high.  <BR><BR>As I worked back upstream I noticed a cacoon shaped object perched on the root wad overhanging the rivers edge.  It was shaped like a foot ball but was probably 4 feet long and 21/2 feet in diameter (hard to tell at 50 yards).  This cacoon like thing appeared to be neetly wrapped in dry grasses like cat tail or pampas grass blades.  I kept fishing moving upstream of them back toward my car, at one point I looked back to get another look anfd the cacoon like thing and the animals were gone.  A day later I drove to the other side of the river to go see if I could track um but the river had flooded the entire area.  <BR><BR>I don''t follow Big Foot stuff, but I do know no bones have ever been found.  As a scintist this encounter has stimulated me to develope a theory.. I theorize that they warn eachother with this BWhooooop sound, and that the reason we have never found their bones is that they cleverly dispose of them by waiting till the rivers are on the rise, packaging the bones, and putting them in the rivers close to their mouths so that they wash out to sea.  I''m not sure I belive in any of this but thats what I saw and heard and thats my theory.  My second theory is that it was an elaborate hoax preformed by somm sort of Big Foot fan club or somthing.  But why would some one do that on an empty river bar I was the only one there and no one knew I was going to be there.<BR><BR>   ",

     " this report is for my daughter who today thinks she saw two big creatures that looked like the  creature called bigfoot. She was pretty shook up about it.  She was so scared that she did not stop. She said the creatures were walking in a pond between Orick and Trinadad off of hwy. 101 this morning about 10:30. She said they were very close. She saw the big ones face. She said it looked like a monkey face. The other one was stooped over so she could not see him very good.<BR>",

     " I was sitting here listening to you on coast to coast and thought I''d tell you about an insident that happened in dec of 97.  the location was in the sierra navada mountains about ten miles above huntington lake which is about 60 miles above fresno in central CA.  Myself and a frind were fourwheeling on light, snow covered roads at about two am. we came around a corner and we both saw something run across the road.  it had very long, shagy red hair and it was running on all fours.  something like a gorilla would when charging.  we only observed it cross the road when we apperently spooked it.  we are both outdoorsman and have seen bears and the like befor.  when it happened, we both simultaneously looked at each other said \"what the hell was that?\" and then said \"we better not tell anyone or they''ll think were crazy!\"  I can''t swear to what it was, but I''ll swear it wasn''t a bear.  this thing was the wrong color to be any kind of cat and it was to thin through the torso as compared to its overall size to be a bear and i suspect bears would have already been in hybernation.  the hair looked like it could have been 18 inches long, very shagy.  its body shape was like a giant human, not a cat or bear.  unfortunately the animal never turned its face toward us at all.

      " My uncle and I were elk hunting near Fossil Ridge northeast of Gunnison, CO when this incident ocurred.  It was late afternoon when we noticed a strong odor that we thought might be elk so we headed east toward a small ridge hoping to find one on the other side.  As we got closer we heard the noise of rocks being banged together.  As we topped the ridge we saw a large dark brown animal squatting at the edge of a dry creek bed with it''s back toward us. It was banging 2 rocks together with it''s \"hands\" and making a grunting/growling noise each time the  rocks hit.<BR><BR>It seemed to sense our presence almost immediately and turned around and looked at us.  Then it quickly stood up and jumped across the creek in one motion.  I remember thinking \"nothing can move like that!\".  It ran up the slope on the north side of the creek bed at an angle and disappeared into the pine and aspen trees farther up the hill.  We could see it for about 50 feet before it was gone from sight.  It moved real quietly for something that big.<BR><BR>I estimate it''s height as 6''5''''.  It was covered with long dark brown hair that made me think of a yak.  It had a strong smell, at least there was a strong smell in the area that was like elk urine.<BR><BR>After we calmed down a bit, we went into the creek bed and found the 2 rocks which were chipped and broken.  We looked for other signs in that place but couldn''t find anything else."

      " I was working in the northern part of New Mexico training to be a Wildland Fire Fighter. In September 2003 (maybe the second week of that month) I was dispatched with 22 other people to the Del Loma Fire in the Shasta/Trinity Forest area, the Northern part of California. Each Crew had about 20 people, our plane that left Albuquerque held 2 crews. For almost the whole two weeks, we were all on standby. On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire. It was close to sun down when, a couple of guys were amazed at something. I heard them from inside my tent, but just ignored the whole thing until one of my crew members came and pulled me out of my tent. <BR><BR>I had no idea what I was supposed to be looking at or for. He pointed across the river and I was in shock when he pointed out the biggest, hairiest mammal I had ever seen just walking along the river side minding his own business. It stopped and looked at us. The way he stood on his hind legs was like an ordinary human. He had dark, long hair and stood about 7ft tall with a muscular build. <BR><BR>At this point I was the 4th person standing there in amazement. Maybe about 5 minutes of watching him watch us, with more people coming out with flashlights (because the sun was still going down) he darted in to the trees. He was running, taking long strides, and was gone in about 3 seconds.....and was literally pushing trees out of his way (not breaking them, but  pushing them out of his way). The trees behind him on his path up the mountain were swaying back and forth. I was surprised to see to these trees moving because they are thick in width and very tall. <BR><BR>By this time it was dark but lit enough to see which way he was headed. Up the mountain a little, there was a clearing, where we spotted him again before he disappeared for good. He made no noise, no yelling or screaming. He was just as timid as can be.<BR><BR>I have heard many stories about Bigfoot, and known that they are real but when seeing one in real life....you get a sense of respect for them and just have that feeling that there is more to life than you know. <BR><BR><BR><BR>"

     " In November 2001, I was guiding for a husband and wife team and was also accompanied by my own wife during a elk hunt. That morning we had located a herd of elk in some remote country and had stalked to their location to find that it was only cows. Since we had bull tag only we did not pursue but instead went out on the point of a mountain to glass for any potential bulls. As our party was sitting and glassing I called periodically hoping for a response from a bull. To my surprise (all of our surprise) we heard a low guttural moan. At first I thought it to be a bull bedded down but the second time I realized that it was no bull at all and could not possibly be a bear. I immediately went toward the noise to confirm what ever had made it and found no animals, no elk, deer, bear, etc. <BR><BR>Shortly after hearing and investigating the sound I moved the party up the mountain to a aspen grove where I knew mid-day bulls would visit to eat. Shortly after positioning the hunters my wife and I took a position higher up the mountain to get a better view and for calling. After sitting in the grove for less than an hour we heard logs being hit together. Not like two bulls fighting but more like someone taking a sizeable log and hitting against another. The end of the day came and we returned to the camp and the hunt was over. <BR><BR>That night two inches of snow fell and I went back to the same location and found a dead cow elk with only her chest cavity being open and from what I could tell having most of her internal organs. I am of course no expert in zoology or cryptolgy [sic] but from my best guess and knowing what I have seen from the past I think that my hunting party and I disturbed a bigfoot while hunting that morning.<BR><BR>I did find tracks but due to the sun melt the tracks were very large with no distinguishable marks. This took place only 8 to 10 miles from the previous sightings.",

     " I was sitting here listening to you on coast to coast and thought I''d tell you about an insident that happened in dec of 97.  the location was in the sierra navada mountains about ten miles above huntington lake which is about 60 miles above fresno in central CA.  Myself and a frind were fourwheeling on light, snow covered roads at about two am. we came around a corner and we both saw something run across the road.  it had very long, shagy red hair and it was running on all fours.  something like a gorilla would when charging.  we only observed it cross the road when we apperently spooked it.  we are both outdoorsman and have seen bears and the like befor.  when it happened, we both simultaneously looked at each other said \"what the hell was that?\" and then said \"we better not tell anyone or they''ll think were crazy!\"  I can''t swear to what it was, but I''ll swear it wasn''t a bear.  this thing was the wrong color to be any kind of cat and it was to thin through the torso as compared to its overall size to be a bear and i suspect bears would have already been in hybernation.  the hair looked like it could have been 18 inches long, very shagy.  its body shape was like a giant human, not a cat or bear.  unfortunately the animal never turned its face toward us at all.

     {" My story of Bigfoot was not visual but rather we heard a scream in the deep forest that we could not explain.  <BR><BR>The location was in the area of Mono Hot Springs, in the Sierra Nevada''s in California, specifically, the John Muir Wilderness.  <BR><BR>My brother friend and I were fishing at Doris Lake near dusk.  Doris Lake is roughly a mile and a half hike from the resort of Mono.  Nothing unusual was happening and then out of nowhere, we heard a scream come from across the lake and up in the Mountians.  There were no people or animals that we could see anywhere.  We were in the proverbial wilderness.  My brother and I looked at each other, and unable to readily discern what we were hearing we continued to fish.  I did say to him, if I hear that again I am out of here. Well, a minute or so later, the same scream.  The three of us immediately reeled in and began to run all the way back to the resort, without stopping.  <BR><BR>I have listened to various recordings of alleged Bigfoot, and I am struck by how similar these recordings are to the scream that we heard.  I did not see anything, so I cant be sure, but I am fairly certian what I heard was not a human, bear or mountian lion.  So....what could it be?<BR><BR>Note:  my brother and sister worked for several years at Mono Hot Springs.  My sisters good friend who worked their as well had a horse which she kept in the summer time at the springs. While riding in the back country, she claims to have seen Bigfoot walking through a meadow below a bluff she was riding atop.    "

It was very heavy, a lot of dust was in the air when I passed the spot where he jumped off the embankment (where he jumped off was about twenty feet from the road).

     " It was a typical winter afternoon in Humbolt County, it was raining intermitantly and the river was on the rise and becoming too turbid to fish.  But, I wanted to catch another steele before the river blew out so, I drove down to the river bar as described in the \"Where did it occur?\" section of this report.  <BR><BR>I parked about 30 yards away from the rivers edge, on a dirt road surrounded by dense willows.  I turned off the car and opened the door.  Immediatly I heard two bellows that seemed far off.  I initially thought it was local kids.  The best I can do to discribe the noise is to ask you to try and make it--- put your lips togeather as if to make the sound of a \"B\" then bellow \"Whoooooooop\", wait two seconds and do it again. This is what I heard.  <BR><BR>To this day I can physically emulate the soud. The sound was similar to the bugle of a bull elk.  I used to work as a horse patrol park ranger on the eastern slope of the Rockies in Rocky Mountain National Park, I kept visitors away from the elk.  In addition, I have frequently heard elk bugle near Oric, CA. I know the bugle of an elk.  That''s not what this was.  <BR><BR>Well, I didn''t think much of it so I got my wadders on and proceeded to the rivers edge.  I wadded in up to my thigh and began fishing moving slowly down stream.  The river was probably about fifty yards wide and nearly at bank full about ten minutes went by and I noticed a dark figure down stream an accross the river, seemingly standing behind a large root wad.  I could see what I though was a head and shoulders of a bear or something? It was drizzeling and I couldn''t focus on it at first, I wasn''t sure it was an animal I thought it might just be part of the root wad.  <BR><BR>As I fished down stream I worked my way dirrectly accross from it and looked at it again, I looked right into its eyes, they were dark, it didn''t move. I then saw another to its left, I could see its body from <BR>the thigh up, it didn''t move, it was looking slightly down stream and I couldn''t see its eyes.  <BR><BR>These things looked taller than a man, had flat faces and large round eyes, their shoulders were broad and their arms were long, they were mostly covered in hair although the one on the left seemed to have bald spots on its chest area, like mange.  They stood still, never once moved.  Ikept fising and tried to work down stream of them to a tailout wher I could cross and sneek up on them to get a closer look, the river was to high.  <BR><BR>As I worked back upstream I noticed a cacoon shaped object perched on the root wad overhanging the rivers edge.  It was shaped like a foot ball but was probably 4 feet long and 21/2 feet in diameter (hard to tell at 50 yards).  This cacoon like thing appeared to be neetly wrapped in dry grasses like cat tail or pampas grass blades.  I kept fishing moving upstream of them back toward my car, at one point I looked back to get another look anfd the cacoon like thing and the animals were gone.  A day later I drove to the other side of the river to go see if I could track um but the river had flooded the entire area.  <BR><BR>I don''t follow Big Foot stuff, but I do know no bones have ever been found.  As a scintist this encounter has stimulated me to develope a theory.. I theorize that they warn eachother with this BWhooooop sound, and that the reason we have never found their bones is that they cleverly dispose of them by waiting till the rivers are on the rise, packaging the bones, and putting them in the rivers close to their mouths so that they wash out to sea.  I''m not sure I belive in any of this but thats what I saw and heard and thats my theory.  My second theory is that it was an elaborate hoax preformed by somm sort of Big Foot fan club or somthing.  But why would some one do that on an empty river bar I was the only one there and no one knew I was going to be there.<BR><BR>   ",

Myself and a frind were fourwheeling on light, snow covered roads at about two am. we came around a corner and we both saw something run across the road.  it had very long, shagy red hair and it was running on all fours.  something like a gorilla would when charging.  we only observed it cross the road when we apperently spooked it.  we are both outdoorsman and have seen bears and the like befor.  when it happened, we both simultaneously looked at each other said \"what the hell was that?\" and then said \"we better not tell anyone or they''ll think were crazy!\"  I can''t swear to what it was, but I''ll swear it wasn''t a bear.  this thing was the wrong color to be any kind of cat and it was to thin through the torso as compared to its overall size to be a bear and i suspect bears would have already been in hybernation.  the hair looked like it could have been 18 inches long, very shagy.  its body shape was like a giant human, not a cat or bear.  unfortunately the animal never turned its face toward us at all.

     {" My story of Bigfoot was not visual but rather we heard a scream in the deep forest that we could not explain.  <BR><BR>The location was in the area of Mono Hot Springs, in the Sierra Nevada''s in California, specifically, the John Muir Wilderness.  <BR><BR>My brother friend and I were fishing at Doris Lake near dusk.  Doris Lake is roughly a mile and a half hike from the resort of Mono.  Nothing unusual was happening and then out of nowhere, we heard a scream come from across the lake and up in the Mountians.  There were no people or animals that we could see anywhere.  We were in the proverbial wilderness.  My brother and I looked at each other, and unable to readily discern what we were hearing we continued to fish.  I did say to him, if I hear that again I am out of here. Well, a minute or so later, the same scream.  The three of us immediately reeled in and began to run all the way back to the resort, without stopping.  <BR><BR>I have listened to various recordings of alleged Bigfoot, and I am struck by how similar these recordings are to the scream that we heard.  I did not see anything, so I cant be sure, but I am fairly certian what I heard was not a human, bear or mountian lion.  So....what could it be?<BR><BR>Note:  my brother and sister worked for several years at Mono Hot Springs.  My sisters good friend who worked their as well had a horse which she kept in the summer time at the springs. While riding in the back country, she claims to have seen Bigfoot walking through a meadow below a bluff she was riding atop.    "

It was very heavy, a lot of dust was in the air when I passed the spot where he jumped off the embankment (where he jumped off was about twenty feet from the road).

     " It was a typical winter afternoon in Humbolt County, it was raining intermitantly and the river was on the rise and becoming too turbid to fish.  But, I wanted to catch another steele before the river blew out so, I drove down to the river bar as described in the \"Where did it occur?\" section of this report.  <BR><BR>I parked about 30 yards away from the rivers edge, on a dirt road surrounded by dense willows.  I turned off the car and opened the door.  Immediatly I heard two bellows that seemed far off.  I initially thought it was local kids.  The best I can do to discribe the noise is to ask you to try and make it--- put your lips togeather as if to make the sound of a \"B\" then bellow \"Whoooooooop\", wait two seconds and do it again. This is what I heard.  <BR><BR>To this day I can physically emulate the soud. The sound was similar to the bugle of a bull elk.  I used to work as a horse patrol park ranger on the eastern slope of the Rockies in Rocky Mountain National Park, I kept visitors away from the elk.  In addition, I have frequently heard elk bugle near Oric, CA. I know the bugle of an elk.  That''s not what this was.  <BR><BR>Well, I didn''t think much of it so I got my wadders on and proceeded to the rivers edge.  I wadded in up to my thigh and began fishing moving slowly down stream.  The river was probably about fifty yards wide and nearly at bank full about ten minutes went by and I noticed a dark figure down stream an accross the river, seemingly standing behind a large root wad.  I could see what I though was a head and shoulders of a bear or something? It was drizzeling and I couldn''t focus on it at first, I wasn''t sure it was an animal I thought it might just be part of the root wad.  <BR><BR>As I fished down stream I worked my way dirrectly accross from it and looked at it again, I looked right into its eyes, they were dark, it didn''t move. I then saw another to its left, I could see its body from <BR>the thigh up, it didn''t move, it was looking slightly down stream and I couldn''t see its eyes.  <BR><BR>These things looked taller than a man, had flat faces and large round eyes, their shoulders were broad and their arms were long, they were mostly covered in hair although the one on the left seemed to have bald spots on its chest area, like mange.  They stood still, never once moved.  Ikept fising and tried to work down stream of them to a tailout wher I could cross and sneek up on them to get a closer look, the river was to high.  <BR><BR>As I worked back upstream I noticed a cacoon shaped object perched on the root wad overhanging the rivers edge.  It was shaped like a foot ball but was probably 4 feet long and 21/2 feet in diameter (hard to tell at 50 yards).  This cacoon like thing appeared to be neetly wrapped in dry grasses like cat tail or pampas grass blades.  I kept fishing moving upstream of them back toward my car, at one point I looked back to get another look anfd the cacoon like thing and the animals were gone.  A day later I drove to the other side of the river to go see if I could track um but the river had flooded the entire area.  <BR><BR>I don''t follow Big Foot stuff, but I do know no bones have ever been found.  As a scintist this encounter has stimulated me to develope a theory.. I theorize that they warn eachother with this BWhooooop sound, and that the reason we have never found their bones is that they cleverly dispose of them by waiting till the rivers are on the rise, packaging the bones, and putting them in the rivers close to their mouths so that they wash out to sea.  I''m not sure I belive in any of this but thats what I saw and heard and thats my theory.  My second theory is that it was an elaborate hoax preformed by somm sort of Big Foot fan club or somthing.  But why would some one do that on an empty river bar I was the only one there and no one knew I was going to be there.<BR><BR>   ",

Myself and a frind were fourwheeling on light, snow covered roads at about two am. we came around a corner and we both saw something run across the road.  it had very long, shagy red hair and it was running on all fours.  something like a gorilla would when charging.  we only observed it cross the road when we apperently spooked it.  we are both outdoorsman and have seen bears and the like befor.  when it happened, we both simultaneously looked at each other said \"what the hell was that?\" and then said \"we better not tell anyone or they''ll think were crazy!\"  I can''t swear to what it was, but I''ll swear it wasn''t a bear.  this thing was the wrong color to be any kind of cat and it was to thin through the torso as compared to its overall size to be a bear and i suspect bears would have already been in hybernation.  the hair looked like it could have been 18 inches long, very shagy.  its body shape was like a giant human, not a cat or bear.  unfortunately the animal never turned its face toward us at all.

     {" My story of Bigfoot was not visual but rather we heard a scream in the deep forest that we could not explain.  <BR><BR>The location was in the area of Mono Hot Springs, in the Sierra Nevada''s in California, specifically, the John Muir Wilderness.  <BR><BR>My brother friend and I were fishing at Doris Lake near dusk.  Doris Lake is roughly a mile and a half hike from the resort of Mono.  Nothing unusual was happening and then out of nowhere, we heard a scream come from across the lake and up in the Mountians.  There were no people or animals that we could see anywhere.  We were in the proverbial wilderness.  My brother and I looked at each other, and unable to readily discern what we were hearing we continued to fish.  I did say to him, if I hear that again I am out of here. Well, a minute or so later, the same scream.  The three of us immediately reeled in and began to run all the way back to the resort, without stopping.  <BR><BR>I have listened to various recordings of alleged Bigfoot, and I am struck by how similar these recordings are to the scream that we heard.  I did not see anything, so I cant be sure, but I am fairly certian what I heard was not a human, bear or mountian lion.  So....what could it be?<BR><BR>Note:  my brother and sister worked for several years at Mono Hot Springs.  My sisters good friend who worked their as well had a horse which she kept in the summer time at the springs. While riding in the back country, she claims to have seen Bigfoot walking through a meadow below a bluff she was riding atop.    "

It was a large man-sized creature on two legs striding very fast (long strides), then it ran very fast and jumped off an embankment. It was very heavy, a lot of dust was in the air when I passed the spot where he jumped off the embankment (where he jumped off was about twenty feet from the road). The creature looked brown and gold in the setting sun."

     " It was a typical winter afternoon in Humbolt County, it was raining intermitantly and the river was on the rise and becoming too turbid to fish.  But, I wanted to catch another steele before the river blew out so, I drove down to the river bar as described in the \"Where did it occur?\" section of this report.  <BR><BR>I parked about 30 yards away from the rivers edge, on a dirt road surrounded by dense willows.  I turned off the car and opened the door.  Immediatly I heard two bellows that seemed far off.  I initially thought it was local kids.  The best I can do to discribe the noise is to ask you to try and make it--- put your lips togeather as if to make the sound of a \"B\" then bellow \"Whoooooooop\", wait two seconds and do it again. This is what I heard.  <BR><BR>To this day I can physically emulate the soud. The sound was similar to the bugle of a bull elk.  I used to work as a horse patrol park ranger on the eastern slope of the Rockies in Rocky Mountain National Park, I kept visitors away from the elk.  In addition, I have frequently heard elk bugle near Oric, CA. I know the bugle of an elk.  That''s not what this was.  <BR><BR>Well, I didn''t think much of it so I got my wadders on and proceeded to the rivers edge.  I wadded in up to my thigh and began fishing moving slowly down stream.  The river was probably about fifty yards wide and nearly at bank full about ten minutes went by and I noticed a dark figure down stream an accross the river, seemingly standing behind a large root wad.  I could see what I though was a head and shoulders of a bear or something? It was drizzeling and I couldn''t focus on it at first, I wasn''t sure it was an animal I thought it might just be part of the root wad.  <BR><BR>As I fished down stream I worked my way dirrectly accross from it and looked at it again, I looked right into its eyes, they were dark, it didn''t move. I then saw another to its left, I could see its body from <BR>the thigh up, it didn''t move, it was looking slightly down stream and I couldn''t see its eyes.  <BR><BR>These things looked taller than a man, had flat faces and large round eyes, their shoulders were broad and their arms were long, they were mostly covered in hair although the one on the left seemed to have bald spots on its chest area, like mange.  They stood still, never once moved.  Ikept fising and tried to work down stream of them to a tailout wher I could cross and sneek up on them to get a closer look, the river was to high.  <BR><BR>As I worked back upstream I noticed a cacoon shaped object perched on the root wad overhanging the rivers edge.  It was shaped like a foot ball but was probably 4 feet long and 21/2 feet in diameter (hard to tell at 50 yards).  This cacoon like thing appeared to be neetly wrapped in dry grasses like cat tail or pampas grass blades.  I kept fishing moving upstream of them back toward my car, at one point I looked back to get another look anfd the cacoon like thing and the animals were gone.  A day later I drove to the other side of the river to go see if I could track um but the river had flooded the entire area.  <BR><BR>I don''t follow Big Foot stuff, but I do know no bones have ever been found.  As a scintist this encounter has stimulated me to develope a theory.. I theorize that they warn eachother with this BWhooooop sound, and that the reason we have never found their bones is that they cleverly dispose of them by waiting till the rivers are on the rise, packaging the bones, and putting them in the rivers close to their mouths so that they wash out to sea.  I''m not sure I belive in any of this but thats what I saw and heard and thats my theory.  My second theory is that it was an elaborate hoax preformed by somm sort of Big Foot fan club or somthing.  But why would some one do that on an empty river bar I was the only one there and no one knew I was going to be there.<BR><BR>   ",

     " I was sitting here listening to you on coast to coast and thought I''d tell you about an insident that happened in dec of 97.  the location was in the sierra navada mountains about ten miles above huntington lake which is about 60 miles above fresno in central CA.  Myself and a frind were fourwheeling on light, snow covered roads at about two am. we came around a corner and we both saw something run across the road.  it had very long, shagy red hair and it was running on all fours.  something like a gorilla would when charging.  we only observed it cross the road when we apperently spooked it.  we are both outdoorsman and have seen bears and the like befor.  when it happened, we both simultaneously looked at each other said \"what the hell was that?\" and then said \"we better not tell anyone or they''ll think were crazy!\"  I can''t swear to what it was, but I''ll swear it wasn''t a bear.  this thing was the wrong color to be any kind of cat and it was to thin through the torso as compared to its overall size to be a bear and i suspect bears would have already been in hybernation.  the hair looked like it could have been 18 inches long, very shagy.  its body shape was like a giant human, not a cat or bear.  unfortunately the animal never turned its face toward us at all.

     {" My story of Bigfoot was not visual but rather we heard a scream in the deep forest that we could not explain.  <BR><BR>The location was in the area of Mono Hot Springs, in the Sierra Nevada''s in California, specifically, the John Muir Wilderness.  <BR><BR>My brother friend and I were fishing at Doris Lake near dusk.  Doris Lake is roughly a mile and a half hike from the resort of Mono.  Nothing unusual was happening and then out of nowhere, we heard a scream come from across the lake and up in the Mountians.  There were no people or animals that we could see anywhere.  We were in the proverbial wilderness.  My brother and I looked at each other, and unable to readily discern what we were hearing we continued to fish.  I did say to him, if I hear that again I am out of here. Well, a minute or so later, the same scream.  The three of us immediately reeled in and began to run all the way back to the resort, without stopping.  <BR><BR>I have listened to various recordings of alleged Bigfoot, and I am struck by how similar these recordings are to the scream that we heard.  I did not see anything, so I cant be sure, but I am fairly certian what I heard was not a human, bear or mountian lion.  So....what could it be?<BR><BR>Note:  my brother and sister worked for several years at Mono Hot Springs.  My sisters good friend who worked their as well had a horse which she kept in the summer time at the springs. While riding in the back country, she claims to have seen Bigfoot walking through a meadow below a bluff she was riding atop.    "

It was a large man-sized creature on two legs striding very fast (long strides), then it ran very fast and jumped off an embankment. It was very heavy, a lot of dust was in the air when I passed the spot where he jumped off the embankment (where he jumped off was about twenty feet from the road). The creature looked brown and gold in the setting sun."

The next day we went out to the same location and noticed several trees had been broken and where blocking the road.  We examined the branchs and they were not cut, but physically broken.  They had to be at least 3-4 inches wide.  We didn''t think anything of it, but we did get a wiff of a bad odor.  If I can find a map of the location, I can give you an exact location."

     " It was a typical winter afternoon in Humbolt County, it was raining intermitantly and the river was on the rise and becoming too turbid to fish.  But, I wanted to catch another steele before the river blew out so, I drove down to the river bar as described in the \"Where did it occur?\" section of this report.  <BR><BR>I parked about 30 yards away from the rivers edge, on a dirt road surrounded by dense willows.  I turned off the car and opened the door.  Immediatly I heard two bellows that seemed far off.  I initially thought it was local kids.  The best I can do to discribe the noise is to ask you to try and make it--- put your lips togeather as if to make the sound of a \"B\" then bellow \"Whoooooooop\", wait two seconds and do it again. This is what I heard.  <BR><BR>To this day I can physically emulate the soud. The sound was similar to the bugle of a bull elk.  I used to work as a horse patrol park ranger on the eastern slope of the Rockies in Rocky Mountain National Park, I kept visitors away from the elk.  In addition, I have frequently heard elk bugle near Oric, CA. I know the bugle of an elk.  That''s not what this was.  <BR><BR>Well, I didn''t think much of it so I got my wadders on and proceeded to the rivers edge.  I wadded in up to my thigh and began fishing moving slowly down stream.  The river was probably about fifty yards wide and nearly at bank full about ten minutes went by and I noticed a dark figure down stream an accross the river, seemingly standing behind a large root wad.  I could see what I though was a head and shoulders of a bear or something? It was drizzeling and I couldn''t focus on it at first, I wasn''t sure it was an animal I thought it might just be part of the root wad.  <BR><BR>As I fished down stream I worked my way dirrectly accross from it and looked at it again, I looked right into its eyes, they were dark, it didn''t move. I then saw another to its left, I could see its body from <BR>the thigh up, it didn''t move, it was looking slightly down stream and I couldn''t see its eyes.  <BR><BR>These things looked taller than a man, had flat faces and large round eyes, their shoulders were broad and their arms were long, they were mostly covered in hair although the one on the left seemed to have bald spots on its chest area, like mange.  They stood still, never once moved.  Ikept fising and tried to work down stream of them to a tailout wher I could cross and sneek up on them to get a closer look, the river was to high.  <BR><BR>As I worked back upstream I noticed a cacoon shaped object perched on the root wad overhanging the rivers edge.  It was shaped like a foot ball but was probably 4 feet long and 21/2 feet in diameter (hard to tell at 50 yards).  This cacoon like thing appeared to be neetly wrapped in dry grasses like cat tail or pampas grass blades.  I kept fishing moving upstream of them back toward my car, at one point I looked back to get another look anfd the cacoon like thing and the animals were gone.  A day later I drove to the other side of the river to go see if I could track um but the river had flooded the entire area.  <BR><BR>I don''t follow Big Foot stuff, but I do know no bones have ever been found.  As a scintist this encounter has stimulated me to develope a theory.. I theorize that they warn eachother with this BWhooooop sound, and that the reason we have never found their bones is that they cleverly dispose of them by waiting till the rivers are on the rise, packaging the bones, and putting them in the rivers close to their mouths so that they wash out to sea.  I''m not sure I belive in any of this but thats what I saw and heard and thats my theory.  My second theory is that it was an elaborate hoax preformed by somm sort of Big Foot fan club or somthing.  But why would some one do that on an empty river bar I was the only one there and no one knew I was going to be there.<BR><BR>   ",

     " I was sitting here listening to you on coast to coast and thought I''d tell you about an insident that happened in dec of 97.  the location was in the sierra navada mountains about ten miles above huntington lake which is about 60 miles above fresno in central CA.  Myself and a frind were fourwheeling on light, snow covered roads at about two am. we came around a corner and we both saw something run across the road.  it had very long, shagy red hair and it was running on all fours.  something like a gorilla would when charging.  we only observed it cross the road when we apperently spooked it.  we are both outdoorsman and have seen bears and the like befor.  when it happened, we both simultaneously looked at each other said \"what the hell was that?\" and then said \"we better not tell anyone or they''ll think were crazy!\"  I can''t swear to what it was, but I''ll swear it wasn''t a bear.  this thing was the wrong color to be any kind of cat and it was to thin through the torso as compared to its overall size to be a bear and i suspect bears would have already been in hybernation.  the hair looked like it could have been 18 inches long, very shagy.  its body shape was like a giant human, not a cat or bear.  unfortunately the animal never turned its face toward us at all.

     {" My story of Bigfoot was not visual but rather we heard a scream in the deep forest that we could not explain.  <BR><BR>The location was in the area of Mono Hot Springs, in the Sierra Nevada''s in California, specifically, the John Muir Wilderness.  <BR><BR>My brother friend and I were fishing at Doris Lake near dusk.  Doris Lake is roughly a mile and a half hike from the resort of Mono.  Nothing unusual was happening and then out of nowhere, we heard a scream come from across the lake and up in the Mountians.  There were no people or animals that we could see anywhere.  We were in the proverbial wilderness.  My brother and I looked at each other, and unable to readily discern what we were hearing we continued to fish.  I did say to him, if I hear that again I am out of here. Well, a minute or so later, the same scream.  The three of us immediately reeled in and began to run all the way back to the resort, without stopping.  <BR><BR>I have listened to various recordings of alleged Bigfoot, and I am struck by how similar these recordings are to the scream that we heard.  I did not see anything, so I cant be sure, but I am fairly certian what I heard was not a human, bear or mountian lion.  So....what could it be?<BR><BR>Note:  my brother and sister worked for several years at Mono Hot Springs.  My sisters good friend who worked their as well had a horse which she kept in the summer time at the springs. While riding in the back country, she claims to have seen Bigfoot walking through a meadow below a bluff she was riding atop.    "

      " I didn''t get out of my car. I didn''t have my camera with me. I noticed a movement on the right of my car ahead of me. It was a large man-sized creature on two legs striding very fast (long strides), then it ran very fast and jumped off an embankment. It was very heavy, a lot of dust was in the air when I passed the spot where he jumped off the embankment (where he jumped off was about twenty feet from the road). The creature looked brown and gold in the setting sun."

The next day we went out to the same location and noticed several trees had been broken and where blocking the road.  We examined the branchs and they were not cut, but physically broken.  They had to be at least 3-4 inches wide.  We didn''t think anything of it, but we did get a wiff of a bad odor.  If I can find a map of the location, I can give you an exact location."

     " It was a typical winter afternoon in Humbolt County, it was raining intermitantly and the river was on the rise and becoming too turbid to fish.  But, I wanted to catch another steele before the river blew out so, I drove down to the river bar as described in the \"Where did it occur?\" section of this report.  <BR><BR>I parked about 30 yards away from the rivers edge, on a dirt road surrounded by dense willows.  I turned off the car and opened the door.  Immediatly I heard two bellows that seemed far off.  I initially thought it was local kids.  The best I can do to discribe the noise is to ask you to try and make it--- put your lips togeather as if to make the sound of a \"B\" then bellow \"Whoooooooop\", wait two seconds and do it again. This is what I heard.  <BR><BR>To this day I can physically emulate the soud. The sound was similar to the bugle of a bull elk.  I used to work as a horse patrol park ranger on the eastern slope of the Rockies in Rocky Mountain National Park, I kept visitors away from the elk.  In addition, I have frequently heard elk bugle near Oric, CA. I know the bugle of an elk.  That''s not what this was.  <BR><BR>Well, I didn''t think much of it so I got my wadders on and proceeded to the rivers edge.  I wadded in up to my thigh and began fishing moving slowly down stream.  The river was probably about fifty yards wide and nearly at bank full about ten minutes went by and I noticed a dark figure down stream an accross the river, seemingly standing behind a large root wad.  I could see what I though was a head and shoulders of a bear or something? It was drizzeling and I couldn''t focus on it at first, I wasn''t sure it was an animal I thought it might just be part of the root wad.  <BR><BR>As I fished down stream I worked my way dirrectly accross from it and looked at it again, I looked right into its eyes, they were dark, it didn''t move. I then saw another to its left, I could see its body from <BR>the thigh up, it didn''t move, it was looking slightly down stream and I couldn''t see its eyes.  <BR><BR>These things looked taller than a man, had flat faces and large round eyes, their shoulders were broad and their arms were long, they were mostly covered in hair although the one on the left seemed to have bald spots on its chest area, like mange.  They stood still, never once moved.  Ikept fising and tried to work down stream of them to a tailout wher I could cross and sneek up on them to get a closer look, the river was to high.  <BR><BR>As I worked back upstream I noticed a cacoon shaped object perched on the root wad overhanging the rivers edge.  It was shaped like a foot ball but was probably 4 feet long and 21/2 feet in diameter (hard to tell at 50 yards).  This cacoon like thing appeared to be neetly wrapped in dry grasses like cat tail or pampas grass blades.  I kept fishing moving upstream of them back toward my car, at one point I looked back to get another look anfd the cacoon like thing and the animals were gone.  A day later I drove to the other side of the river to go see if I could track um but the river had flooded the entire area.  <BR><BR>I don''t follow Big Foot stuff, but I do know no bones have ever been found.  As a scintist this encounter has stimulated me to develope a theory.. I theorize that they warn eachother with this BWhooooop sound, and that the reason we have never found their bones is that they cleverly dispose of them by waiting till the rivers are on the rise, packaging the bones, and putting them in the rivers close to their mouths so that they wash out to sea.  I''m not sure I belive in any of this but thats what I saw and heard and thats my theory.  My second theory is that it was an elaborate hoax preformed by somm sort of Big Foot fan club or somthing.  But why would some one do that on an empty river bar I was the only one there and no one knew I was going to be there.<BR><BR>   ",

     " this report is for my daughter who today thinks she saw two big creatures that looked like the  creature called bigfoot. She was pretty shook up about it.  She was so scared that she did not stop. She said the creatures were walking in a pond between Orick and Trinadad off of hwy. 101 this morning about 10:30. She said they were very close. She saw the big ones face. She said it looked like a monkey face. The other one was stooped over so she could not see him very good.<BR>",

     " I was sitting here listening to you on coast to coast and thought I''d tell you about an insident that happened in dec of 97.  the location was in the sierra navada mountains about ten miles above huntington lake which is about 60 miles above fresno in central CA.  Myself and a frind were fourwheeling on light, snow covered roads at about two am. we came around a corner and we both saw something run across the road.  it had very long, shagy red hair and it was running on all fours.  something like a gorilla would when charging.  we only observed it cross the road when we apperently spooked it.  we are both outdoorsman and have seen bears and the like befor.  when it happened, we both simultaneously looked at each other said \"what the hell was that?\" and then said \"we better not tell anyone or they''ll think were crazy!\"  I can''t swear to what it was, but I''ll swear it wasn''t a bear.  this thing was the wrong color to be any kind of cat and it was to thin through the torso as compared to its overall size to be a bear and i suspect bears would have already been in hybernation.  the hair looked like it could have been 18 inches long, very shagy.  its body shape was like a giant human, not a cat or bear.  unfortunately the animal never turned its face toward us at all.

     " It was a typical winter afternoon in Humbolt County, it was raining intermitantly and the river was on the rise and becoming too turbid to fish.  But, I wanted to catch another steele before the river blew out so, I drove down to the river bar as described in the \"Where did it occur?\" section of this report.  <BR><BR>I parked about 30 yards away from the rivers edge, on a dirt road surrounded by dense willows.  I turned off the car and opened the door.  Immediatly I heard two bellows that seemed far off.  I initially thought it was local kids.  The best I can do to discribe the noise is to ask you to try and make it--- put your lips togeather as if to make the sound of a \"B\" then bellow \"Whoooooooop\", wait two seconds and do it again. This is what I heard.  <BR><BR>To this day I can physically emulate the soud. The sound was similar to the bugle of a bull elk.  I used to work as a horse patrol park ranger on the eastern slope of the Rockies in Rocky Mountain National Park, I kept visitors away from the elk.  In addition, I have frequently heard elk bugle near Oric, CA. I know the bugle of an elk.  That''s not what this was.  <BR><BR>Well, I didn''t think much of it so I got my wadders on and proceeded to the rivers edge.  I wadded in up to my thigh and began fishing moving slowly down stream.  The river was probably about fifty yards wide and nearly at bank full about ten minutes went by and I noticed a dark figure down stream an accross the river, seemingly standing behind a large root wad.  I could see what I though was a head and shoulders of a bear or something? It was drizzeling and I couldn''t focus on it at first, I wasn''t sure it was an animal I thought it might just be part of the root wad.  <BR><BR>As I fished down stream I worked my way dirrectly accross from it and looked at it again, I looked right into its eyes, they were dark, it didn''t move. I then saw another to its left, I could see its body from <BR>the thigh up, it didn''t move, it was looking slightly down stream and I couldn''t see its eyes.  <BR><BR>These things looked taller than a man, had flat faces and large round eyes, their shoulders were broad and their arms were long, they were mostly covered in hair although the one on the left seemed to have bald spots on its chest area, like mange.  They stood still, never once moved.  Ikept fising and tried to work down stream of them to a tailout wher I could cross and sneek up on them to get a closer look, the river was to high.  <BR><BR>As I worked back upstream I noticed a cacoon shaped object perched on the root wad overhanging the rivers edge.  It was shaped like a foot ball but was probably 4 feet long and 21/2 feet in diameter (hard to tell at 50 yards).  This cacoon like thing appeared to be neetly wrapped in dry grasses like cat tail or pampas grass blades.  I kept fishing moving upstream of them back toward my car, at one point I looked back to get another look anfd the cacoon like thing and the animals were gone.  A day later I drove to the other side of the river to go see if I could track um but the river had flooded the entire area.  <BR><BR>I don''t follow Big Foot stuff, but I do know no bones have ever been found.  As a scintist this encounter has stimulated me to develope a theory.. I theorize that they warn eachother with this BWhooooop sound, and that the reason we have never found their bones is that they cleverly dispose of them by waiting till the rivers are on the rise, packaging the bones, and putting them in the rivers close to their mouths so that they wash out to sea.  I''m not sure I belive in any of this but thats what I saw and heard and thats my theory.  My second theory is that it was an elaborate hoax preformed by somm sort of Big Foot fan club or somthing.  But why would some one do that on an empty river bar I was the only one there and no one knew I was going to be there.<BR><BR>   ",

     " this report is for my daughter who today thinks she saw two big creatures that looked like the  creature called bigfoot. She was pretty shook up about it.  She was so scared that she did not stop. She said the creatures were walking in a pond between Orick and Trinadad off of hwy. 101 this morning about 10:30. She said they were very close. She saw the big ones face. She said it looked like a monkey face. The other one was stooped over so she could not see him very good.<BR>",

     " I was sitting here listening to you on coast to coast and thought I''d tell you about an insident that happened in dec of 97.  the location was in the sierra navada mountains about ten miles above huntington lake which is about 60 miles above fresno in central CA.  Myself and a frind were fourwheeling on light, snow covered roads at about two am. we came around a corner and we both saw something run across the road.  it had very long, shagy red hair and it was running on all fours.  something like a gorilla would when charging.  we only observed it cross the road when we apperently spooked it.  we are both outdoorsman and have seen bears and the like befor.  when it happened, we both simultaneously looked at each other said \"what the hell was that?\" and then said \"we better not tell anyone or they''ll think were crazy!\"  I can''t swear to what it was, but I''ll swear it wasn''t a bear.  this thing was the wrong color to be any kind of cat and it was to thin through the torso as compared to its overall size to be a bear and i suspect bears would have already been in hybernation.  the hair looked like it could have been 18 inches long, very shagy.  its body shape was like a giant human, not a cat or bear.  unfortunately the animal never turned its face toward us at all.

It was drizzeling and I couldn''t focus on it at first, I wasn''t sure it was an animal I thought it might just be part of the root wad.  <BR><BR>As I fished down stream I worked my way dirrectly accross from it and looked at it again, I looked right into its eyes, they were dark, it didn''t move. I then saw another to its left, I could see its body from <BR>the thigh up, it didn''t move, it was looking slightly down stream and I couldn''t see its eyes.  <BR><BR>These things looked taller than a man, had flat faces and large round eyes, their shoulders were broad and their arms were long, they were mostly covered in hair although the one on the left seemed to have bald spots on its chest area, like mange.  They stood still, never once moved.  Ikept fising and tried to work down stream of them to a tailout wher I could cross and sneek up on them to get a closer look, the river was to high.  <BR><BR>As I worked back upstream I noticed a cacoon shaped object perched on the root wad overhanging the rivers edge.  It was shaped like a foot ball but was probably 4 feet long and 21/2 feet in diameter (hard to tell at 50 yards).  This cacoon like thing appeared to be neetly wrapped in dry grasses like cat tail or pampas grass blades.  I kept fishing moving upstream of them back toward my car, at one point I looked back to get another look anfd the cacoon like thing and the animals were gone.  A day later I drove to the other side of the river to go see if I could track um but the river had flooded the entire area.  <BR><BR>I don''t follow Big Foot stuff, but I do know no bones have ever been found.  As a scintist this encounter has stimulated me to develope a theory.. I theorize that they warn eachother with this BWhooooop sound, and that the reason we have never found their bones is that they cleverly dispose of them by waiting till the rivers are on the rise, packaging the bones, and putting them in the rivers close to their mouths so that they wash out to sea.

Doris Lake is roughly a mile and a half hike from the resort of Mono.  Nothing unusual was happening and then out of nowhere, we heard a scream come from across the lake and up in the Mountians.  There were no people or animals that we could see anywhere.  We were in the proverbial wilderness.  My brother and I looked at each other, and unable to readily discern what we were hearing we continued to fish.  I did say to him, if I hear that again I am out of here. Well, a minute or so later, the same scream.  The three of us immediately reeled in and began to run all the way back to the resort, without stopping.  <BR><BR>I have listened to various recordings of alleged Bigfoot, and I am struck by how similar these recordings are to the scream that we heard.  I did not see anything, so I cant be sure, but I am fairly certian what I heard was not a human, bear or mountian lion.  So....what could it be?<BR><BR>Note:  my brother and sister worked for several years at Mono Hot Springs.  My sisters good friend who worked their as well had a horse which she kept in the summer time at the springs.

     " It was a typical winter afternoon in Humbolt County, it was raining intermitantly and the river was on the rise and becoming too turbid to fish.  But, I wanted to catch another steele before the river blew out so, I drove down to the river bar as described in the \"Where did it occur?\" section of this report.  <BR><BR>I parked about 30 yards away from the rivers edge, on a dirt road surrounded by dense willows.  I turned off the car and opened the door.  Immediatly I heard two bellows that seemed far off.  I initially thought it was local kids.  The best I can do to discribe the noise is to ask you to try and make it--- put your lips togeather as if to make the sound of a \"B\" then bellow \"Whoooooooop\", wait two seconds and do it again. This is what I heard.  <BR><BR>To this day I can physically emulate the soud. The sound was similar to the bugle of a bull elk.  I used to work as a horse patrol park ranger on the eastern slope of the Rockies in Rocky Mountain National Park, I kept visitors away from the elk.  In addition, I have frequently heard elk bugle near Oric, CA. I know the bugle of an elk.  That''s not what this was.  <BR><BR>Well, I didn''t think much of it so I got my wadders on and proceeded to the rivers edge.  I wadded in up to my thigh and began fishing moving slowly down stream.  The river was probably about fifty yards wide and nearly at bank full about ten minutes went by and I noticed a dark figure down stream an accross the river, seemingly standing behind a large root wad.  I could see what I though was a head and shoulders of a bear or something? It was drizzeling and I couldn''t focus on it at first, I wasn''t sure it was an animal I thought it might just be part of the root wad.  <BR><BR>As I fished down stream I worked my way dirrectly accross from it and looked at it again, I looked right into its eyes, they were dark, it didn''t move. I then saw another to its left, I could see its body from <BR>the thigh up, it didn''t move, it was looking slightly down stream and I couldn''t see its eyes.  <BR><BR>These things looked taller than a man, had flat faces and large round eyes, their shoulders were broad and their arms were long, they were mostly covered in hair although the one on the left seemed to have bald spots on its chest area, like mange.  They stood still, never once moved.  Ikept fising and tried to work down stream of them to a tailout wher I could cross and sneek up on them to get a closer look, the river was to high.  <BR><BR>As I worked back upstream I noticed a cacoon shaped object perched on the root wad overhanging the rivers edge.  It was shaped like a foot ball but was probably 4 feet long and 21/2 feet in diameter (hard to tell at 50 yards).  This cacoon like thing appeared to be neetly wrapped in dry grasses like cat tail or pampas grass blades.  I kept fishing moving upstream of them back toward my car, at one point I looked back to get another look anfd the cacoon like thing and the animals were gone.  A day later I drove to the other side of the river to go see if I could track um but the river had flooded the entire area.  <BR><BR>I don''t follow Big Foot stuff, but I do know no bones have ever been found.  As a scintist this encounter has stimulated me to develope a theory..

     {" My story of Bigfoot was not visual but rather we heard a scream in the deep forest that we could not explain.  <BR><BR>The location was in the area of Mono Hot Springs, in the Sierra Nevada''s in California, specifically, the John Muir Wilderness.  <BR><BR>My brother friend and I were fishing at Doris Lake near dusk.  Doris Lake is roughly a mile and a half hike from the resort of Mono.  Nothing unusual was happening and then out of nowhere, we heard a scream come from across the lake and up in the Mountians.  There were no people or animals that we could see anywhere.  We were in the proverbial wilderness.  My brother and I looked at each other, and unable to readily discern what we were hearing we continued to fish.  I did say to him, if I hear that again I am out of here. Well, a minute or so later, the same scream.  The three of us immediately reeled in and began to run all the way back to the resort, without stopping.  <BR><BR>I have listened to various recordings of alleged Bigfoot, and I am struck by how similar these recordings are to the scream that we heard.  I did not see anything, so I cant be sure, but I am fairly certian what I heard was not a human, bear or mountian lion.  So....what could it be?<BR><BR>Note:  my brother and sister worked for several years at Mono Hot Springs.  My sisters good friend who worked their as well had a horse which she kept in the summer time at the springs. While riding in the back country, she claims to have seen Bigfoot walking through a meadow below a bluff she was riding atop.    "

It was a large man-sized creature on two legs striding very fast (long strides), then it ran very fast and jumped off an embankment. It was very heavy, a lot of dust was in the air when I passed the spot where he jumped off the embankment (where he jumped off was about twenty feet from the road). The creature looked brown and gold in the setting sun."

The next day we went out to the same location and noticed several trees had been broken and where blocking the road.  We examined the branchs and they were not cut, but physically broken.  They had to be at least 3-4 inches wide.  We didn''t think anything of it, but we did get a wiff of a bad odor.  If I can find a map of the location, I can give you an exact location."

     " It was a typical winter afternoon in Humbolt County, it was raining intermitantly and the river was on the rise and becoming too turbid to fish.  But, I wanted to catch another steele before the river blew out so, I drove down to the river bar as described in the \"Where did it occur?\" section of this report.  <BR><BR>I parked about 30 yards away from the rivers edge, on a dirt road surrounded by dense willows.  I turned off the car and opened the door.  Immediatly I heard two bellows that seemed far off.  I initially thought it was local kids.  The best I can do to discribe the noise is to ask you to try and make it--- put your lips togeather as if to make the sound of a \"B\" then bellow \"Whoooooooop\", wait two seconds and do it again. This is what I heard.  <BR><BR>To this day I can physically emulate the soud. The sound was similar to the bugle of a bull elk.  I used to work as a horse patrol park ranger on the eastern slope of the Rockies in Rocky Mountain National Park, I kept visitors away from the elk.  In addition, I have frequently heard elk bugle near Oric, CA. I know the bugle of an elk.  That''s not what this was.  <BR><BR>Well, I didn''t think much of it so I got my wadders on and proceeded to the rivers edge.  I wadded in up to my thigh and began fishing moving slowly down stream.  The river was probably about fifty yards wide and nearly at bank full about ten minutes went by and I noticed a dark figure down stream an accross the river, seemingly standing behind a large root wad.  I could see what I though was a head and shoulders of a bear or something? It was drizzeling and I couldn''t focus on it at first, I wasn''t sure it was an animal I thought it might just be part of the root wad.  <BR><BR>As I fished down stream I worked my way dirrectly accross from it and looked at it again, I looked right into its eyes, they were dark, it didn''t move. I then saw another to its left, I could see its body from <BR>the thigh up, it didn''t move, it was looking slightly down stream and I couldn''t see its eyes.  <BR><BR>These things looked taller than a man, had flat faces and large round eyes, their shoulders were broad and their arms were long, they were mostly covered in hair although the one on the left seemed to have bald spots on its chest area, like mange.  They stood still, never once moved.  Ikept fising and tried to work down stream of them to a tailout wher I could cross and sneek up on them to get a closer look, the river was to high.  <BR><BR>As I worked back upstream I noticed a cacoon shaped object perched on the root wad overhanging the rivers edge.  It was shaped like a foot ball but was probably 4 feet long and 21/2 feet in diameter (hard to tell at 50 yards).  This cacoon like thing appeared to be neetly wrapped in dry grasses like cat tail or pampas grass blades.  I kept fishing moving upstream of them back toward my car, at one point I looked back to get another look anfd the cacoon like thing and the animals were gone.  A day later I drove to the other side of the river to go see if I could track um but the river had flooded the entire area.  <BR><BR>I don''t follow Big Foot stuff, but I do know no bones have ever been found.  As a scintist this encounter has stimulated me to develope a theory.. I theorize that they warn eachother with this BWhooooop sound, and that the reason we have never found their bones is that they cleverly dispose of them by waiting till the rivers are on the rise, packaging the bones, and putting them in the rivers close to their mouths so that they wash out to sea.  I''m not sure I belive in any of this but thats what I saw and heard and thats my theory.  My second theory is that it was an elaborate hoax preformed by somm sort of Big Foot fan club or somthing.  But why would some one do that on an empty river bar I was the only one there and no one knew I was going to be there.<BR><BR>   ",

     " I was sitting here listening to you on coast to coast and thought I''d tell you about an insident that happened in dec of 97.  the location was in the sierra navada mountains about ten miles above huntington lake which is about 60 miles above fresno in central CA.  Myself and a frind were fourwheeling on light, snow covered roads at about two am. we came around a corner and we both saw something run across the road.  it had very long, shagy red hair and it was running on all fours.  something like a gorilla would when charging.  we only observed it cross the road when we apperently spooked it.  we are both outdoorsman and have seen bears and the like befor.  when it happened, we both simultaneously looked at each other said \"what the hell was that?\" and then said \"we better not tell anyone or they''ll think were crazy!\"  I can''t swear to what it was, but I''ll swear it wasn''t a bear.  this thing was the wrong color to be any kind of cat and it was to thin through the torso as compared to its overall size to be a bear and i suspect bears would have already been in hybernation.  the hair looked like it could have been 18 inches long, very shagy.  its body shape was like a giant human, not a cat or bear.  unfortunately the animal never turned its face toward us at all.

     {" My story of Bigfoot was not visual but rather we heard a scream in the deep forest that we could not explain.  <BR><BR>The location was in the area of Mono Hot Springs, in the Sierra Nevada''s in California, specifically, the John Muir Wilderness.  <BR><BR>My brother friend and I were fishing at Doris Lake near dusk.  Doris Lake is roughly a mile and a half hike from the resort of Mono.  Nothing unusual was happening and then out of nowhere, we heard a scream come from across the lake and up in the Mountians.  There were no people or animals that we could see anywhere.  We were in the proverbial wilderness.  My brother and I looked at each other, and unable to readily discern what we were hearing we continued to fish.  I did say to him, if I hear that again I am out of here. Well, a minute or so later, the same scream.  The three of us immediately reeled in and began to run all the way back to the resort, without stopping.  <BR><BR>I have listened to various recordings of alleged Bigfoot, and I am struck by how similar these recordings are to the scream that we heard.  I did not see anything, so I cant be sure, but I am fairly certian what I heard was not a human, bear or mountian lion.  So....what could it be?<BR><BR>Note:  my brother and sister worked for several years at Mono Hot Springs.  My sisters good friend who worked their as well had a horse which she kept in the summer time at the springs. While riding in the back country, she claims to have seen Bigfoot walking through a meadow below a bluff she was riding atop.    "

It was a large man-sized creature on two legs striding very fast (long strides), then it ran very fast and jumped off an embankment. It was very heavy, a lot of dust was in the air when I passed the spot where he jumped off the embankment (where he jumped off was about twenty feet from the road). The creature looked brown and gold in the setting sun."

The next day we went out to the same location and noticed several trees had been broken and where blocking the road.  We examined the branchs and they were not cut, but physically broken.  They had to be at least 3-4 inches wide.  We didn''t think anything of it, but we did get a wiff of a bad odor.  If I can find a map of the location, I can give you an exact location."

     " It was a typical winter afternoon in Humbolt County, it was raining intermitantly and the river was on the rise and becoming too turbid to fish.  But, I wanted to catch another steele before the river blew out so, I drove down to the river bar as described in the \"Where did it occur?\" section of this report.  <BR><BR>I parked about 30 yards away from the rivers edge, on a dirt road surrounded by dense willows.  I turned off the car and opened the door.  Immediatly I heard two bellows that seemed far off.  I initially thought it was local kids.  The best I can do to discribe the noise is to ask you to try and make it--- put your lips togeather as if to make the sound of a \"B\" then bellow \"Whoooooooop\", wait two seconds and do it again. This is what I heard.  <BR><BR>To this day I can physically emulate the soud. The sound was similar to the bugle of a bull elk.  I used to work as a horse patrol park ranger on the eastern slope of the Rockies in Rocky Mountain National Park, I kept visitors away from the elk.  In addition, I have frequently heard elk bugle near Oric, CA. I know the bugle of an elk.  That''s not what this was.  <BR><BR>Well, I didn''t think much of it so I got my wadders on and proceeded to the rivers edge.  I wadded in up to my thigh and began fishing moving slowly down stream.  The river was probably about fifty yards wide and nearly at bank full about ten minutes went by and I noticed a dark figure down stream an accross the river, seemingly standing behind a large root wad.  I could see what I though was a head and shoulders of a bear or something? It was drizzeling and I couldn''t focus on it at first, I wasn''t sure it was an animal I thought it might just be part of the root wad.  <BR><BR>As I fished down stream I worked my way dirrectly accross from it and looked at it again, I looked right into its eyes, they were dark, it didn''t move. I then saw another to its left, I could see its body from <BR>the thigh up, it didn''t move, it was looking slightly down stream and I couldn''t see its eyes.  <BR><BR>These things looked taller than a man, had flat faces and large round eyes, their shoulders were broad and their arms were long, they were mostly covered in hair although the one on the left seemed to have bald spots on its chest area, like mange.  They stood still, never once moved.  Ikept fising and tried to work down stream of them to a tailout wher I could cross and sneek up on them to get a closer look, the river was to high.  <BR><BR>As I worked back upstream I noticed a cacoon shaped object perched on the root wad overhanging the rivers edge.  It was shaped like a foot ball but was probably 4 feet long and 21/2 feet in diameter (hard to tell at 50 yards).  This cacoon like thing appeared to be neetly wrapped in dry grasses like cat tail or pampas grass blades.  I kept fishing moving upstream of them back toward my car, at one point I looked back to get another look anfd the cacoon like thing and the animals were gone.  A day later I drove to the other side of the river to go see if I could track um but the river had flooded the entire area.  <BR><BR>I don''t follow Big Foot stuff, but I do know no bones have ever been found.  As a scintist this encounter has stimulated me to develope a theory.. I theorize that they warn eachother with this BWhooooop sound, and that the reason we have never found their bones is that they cleverly dispose of them by waiting till the rivers are on the rise, packaging the bones, and putting them in the rivers close to their mouths so that they wash out to sea.  I''m not sure I belive in any of this but thats what I saw and heard and thats my theory.  My second theory is that it was an elaborate hoax preformed by somm sort of Big Foot fan club or somthing.  But why would some one do that on an empty river bar I was the only one there and no one knew I was going to be there.<BR><BR>   ",

She was so scared that she did not stop. She said the creatures were walking in a pond between Orick and Trinadad off of hwy. 101 this morning about 10:30. She said they were very close.

     " I was sitting here listening to you on coast to coast and thought I''d tell you about an insident that happened in dec of 97.  the location was in the sierra navada mountains about ten miles above huntington lake which is about 60 miles above fresno in central CA.  Myself and a frind were fourwheeling on light, snow covered roads at about two am. we came around a corner and we both saw something run across the road.  it had very long, shagy red hair and it was running on all fours.  something like a gorilla would when charging.  we only observed it cross the road when we apperently spooked it.  we are both outdoorsman and have seen bears and the like befor.  when it happened, we both simultaneously looked at each other said \"what the hell was that?\" and then said \"we better not tell anyone or they''ll think were crazy!\"  I can''t swear to what it was, but I''ll swear it wasn''t a bear.  this thing was the wrong color to be any kind of cat and it was to thin through the torso as compared to its overall size to be a bear and i suspect bears would have already been in hybernation.  the hair looked like it could have been 18 inches long, very shagy.  its body shape was like a giant human, not a cat or bear.  unfortunately the animal never turned its face toward us at all.

     {" My story of Bigfoot was not visual but rather we heard a scream in the deep forest that we could not explain.  <BR><BR>The location was in the area of Mono Hot Springs, in the Sierra Nevada''s in California, specifically, the John Muir Wilderness.  <BR><BR>My brother friend and I were fishing at Doris Lake near dusk.  Doris Lake is roughly a mile and a half hike from the resort of Mono.  Nothing unusual was happening and then out of nowhere, we heard a scream come from across the lake and up in the Mountians.  There were no people or animals that we could see anywhere.  We were in the proverbial wilderness.  My brother and I looked at each other, and unable to readily discern what we were hearing we continued to fish.  I did say to him, if I hear that again I am out of here. Well, a minute or so later, the same scream.  The three of us immediately reeled in and began to run all the way back to the resort, without stopping.  <BR><BR>I have listened to various recordings of alleged Bigfoot, and I am struck by how similar these recordings are to the scream that we heard.  I did not see anything, so I cant be sure, but I am fairly certian what I heard was not a human, bear or mountian lion.  So....what could it be?<BR><BR>Note:  my brother and sister worked for several years at Mono Hot Springs.  My sisters good friend who worked their as well had a horse which she kept in the summer time at the springs. While riding in the back country, she claims to have seen Bigfoot walking through a meadow below a bluff she was riding atop.    "

      " I didn''t get out of my car. I didn''t have my camera with me. I noticed a movement on the right of my car ahead of me. It was a large man-sized creature on two legs striding very fast (long strides), then it ran very fast and jumped off an embankment. It was very heavy, a lot of dust was in the air when I passed the spot where he jumped off the embankment (where he jumped off was about twenty feet from the road). The creature looked brown and gold in the setting sun."

The next day we went out to the same location and noticed several trees had been broken and where blocking the road.  We examined the branchs and they were not cut, but physically broken.  They had to be at least 3-4 inches wide.  We didn''t think anything of it, but we did get a wiff of a bad odor.  If I can find a map of the location, I can give you an exact location."

     " It was a typical winter afternoon in Humbolt County, it was raining intermitantly and the river was on the rise and becoming too turbid to fish.  But, I wanted to catch another steele before the river blew out so, I drove down to the river bar as described in the \"Where did it occur?\" section of this report.  <BR><BR>I parked about 30 yards away from the rivers edge, on a dirt road surrounded by dense willows.  I turned off the car and opened the door.  Immediatly I heard two bellows that seemed far off.  I initially thought it was local kids.  The best I can do to discribe the noise is to ask you to try and make it--- put your lips togeather as if to make the sound of a \"B\" then bellow \"Whoooooooop\", wait two seconds and do it again. This is what I heard.  <BR><BR>To this day I can physically emulate the soud. The sound was similar to the bugle of a bull elk.  I used to work as a horse patrol park ranger on the eastern slope of the Rockies in Rocky Mountain National Park, I kept visitors away from the elk.  In addition, I have frequently heard elk bugle near Oric, CA. I know the bugle of an elk.  That''s not what this was.  <BR><BR>Well, I didn''t think much of it so I got my wadders on and proceeded to the rivers edge.  I wadded in up to my thigh and began fishing moving slowly down stream.  The river was probably about fifty yards wide and nearly at bank full about ten minutes went by and I noticed a dark figure down stream an accross the river, seemingly standing behind a large root wad.  I could see what I though was a head and shoulders of a bear or something? It was drizzeling and I couldn''t focus on it at first, I wasn''t sure it was an animal I thought it might just be part of the root wad.  <BR><BR>As I fished down stream I worked my way dirrectly accross from it and looked at it again, I looked right into its eyes, they were dark, it didn''t move. I then saw another to its left, I could see its body from <BR>the thigh up, it didn''t move, it was looking slightly down stream and I couldn''t see its eyes.  <BR><BR>These things looked taller than a man, had flat faces and large round eyes, their shoulders were broad and their arms were long, they were mostly covered in hair although the one on the left seemed to have bald spots on its chest area, like mange.  They stood still, never once moved.  Ikept fising and tried to work down stream of them to a tailout wher I could cross and sneek up on them to get a closer look, the river was to high.  <BR><BR>As I worked back upstream I noticed a cacoon shaped object perched on the root wad overhanging the rivers edge.  It was shaped like a foot ball but was probably 4 feet long and 21/2 feet in diameter (hard to tell at 50 yards).  This cacoon like thing appeared to be neetly wrapped in dry grasses like cat tail or pampas grass blades.  I kept fishing moving upstream of them back toward my car, at one point I looked back to get another look anfd the cacoon like thing and the animals were gone.  A day later I drove to the other side of the river to go see if I could track um but the river had flooded the entire area.  <BR><BR>I don''t follow Big Foot stuff, but I do know no bones have ever been found.  As a scintist this encounter has stimulated me to develope a theory.. I theorize that they warn eachother with this BWhooooop sound, and that the reason we have never found their bones is that they cleverly dispose of them by waiting till the rivers are on the rise, packaging the bones, and putting them in the rivers close to their mouths so that they wash out to sea.  I''m not sure I belive in any of this but thats what I saw and heard and thats my theory.  My second theory is that it was an elaborate hoax preformed by somm sort of Big Foot fan club or somthing.  But why would some one do that on an empty river bar I was the only one there and no one knew I was going to be there.<BR><BR>   ",

     " this report is for my daughter who today thinks she saw two big creatures that looked like the  creature called bigfoot. She was pretty shook up about it.  She was so scared that she did not stop. She said the creatures were walking in a pond between Orick and Trinadad off of hwy. 101 this morning about 10:30. She said they were very close. She saw the big ones face. She said it looked like a monkey face. The other one was stooped over so she could not see him very good.<BR>",

     " I was sitting here listening to you on coast to coast and thought I''d tell you about an insident that happened in dec of 97.  the location was in the sierra navada mountains about ten miles above huntington lake which is about 60 miles above fresno in central CA.  Myself and a frind were fourwheeling on light, snow covered roads at about two am. we came around a corner and we both saw something run across the road.  it had very long, shagy red hair and it was running on all fours.  something like a gorilla would when charging.  we only observed it cross the road when we apperently spooked it.  we are both outdoorsman and have seen bears and the like befor.  when it happened, we both simultaneously looked at each other said \"what the hell was that?\" and then said \"we better not tell anyone or they''ll think were crazy!\"  I can''t swear to what it was, but I''ll swear it wasn''t a bear.  this thing was the wrong color to be any kind of cat and it was to thin through the torso as compared to its overall size to be a bear and i suspect bears would have already been in hybernation.  the hair looked like it could have been 18 inches long, very shagy.  its body shape was like a giant human, not a cat or bear.  unfortunately the animal never turned its face toward us at all.
