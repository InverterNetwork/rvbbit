There was snow on the ground and it was freezing outside.  My mother has a habit of looking out the bathroom window early in the morning.  On this cold winter morning, with the landscaped dressed in a blanket of white and without any visible signs of being touched by human or animal footprints, she saw what looked like 3 very large humanoid footprints. It was so strange that my mother made me get up to take a look.  We put our coats on and went outside to investigate.  We couldn''t believe our eyes.  There in the snow were 3 very, very large humanoid footprints.  We couldn''t figure out where they came from or where they went.  It literally looked as it came from no where and went no where, because the footprints did not leave a trail.  The footprints were so large I could almost stand in it.  You could literally see the 5 toes with foot and toe imprints in the snow.  We couldn''t believe what we were seeing.  Who or what has a foot that big and who or what would be out in this weather barefooted.<BR><BR>" 1, " April 29 2006 about 630pm I just left the Livingston mall and was heading home but got all turned about since I don''t go up that way very often. Anyhow I was figuring that I was north of rt 78 and just kind of \"Lewis and Clarked\" it toward home via the mirror compass in my car and made the first left southbound that I could once I realized I was heading west and didn''t recognize any landmarks. <BR><BR>I turn down this road and notice some construction equipment not far off into the trees on the right side of the road. I was driving slower than normal being unfarmiliar with the area and since I kept peeking at the compass to make sure I was still southbound (looking back it must have been overcast since I would have just used the location of the sun as a reference to direction).<BR>As I was driving along I caught movement out of the corner of my eye and saw a young deer (judging by size) bolt out of the trees across the road from left to right about 100-200 feet in front of my car. I just took my foot off the gas and didn''t need to brake, then I looked left for followers and saw what appeard to be a hunter in a dark colored ghillie suit burst from the trees after the deer. I couldnt make out any details of the face feet or hands but he/it was only around 6 feet tall or so and I''d estimate the low 200lb range but was unusually fast especially for someone dressed like that. The second thought in my head since I fish and shoot a bit was that it couldn''t possibly be legal to hunt around that area since its fairly close to residential zones. Then I noticed that the hunter had no weapons in his hands. I got up to the spot where they crossed and looked right and noticed that the biped (hunter) actually closed ground on the deer and was still in pursuit. I don''t know if the deer stopped to look back at some point as they some times do but this thing was in a full tilt sprint over what I would assume to be uneven ground and didn''t stumble once. I didn''t hear or smell anything since I had my roof up and AC & radio on at the time. All of this happened I would estimate in less than 20 seconds total." 1}, :cardinality 99}, :environment {:data-type "string", :distinct 482, :commons {nil 15, "wooded area" 3, "Mountain ridge" 2},

Fossil Ridge northeast of Gunnison, CO when this incident ocurred.  It was late afternoon when we noticed a strong odor that we thought might be elk so we headed east toward a small ridge hoping to find one on the other side.  As we got closer we heard the noise of rocks being banged together.  As we topped the ridge we saw a large dark brown animal squatting at the edge of a dry creek bed with it''s back toward us. It was banging 2 rocks together with it''s \"hands\" and making a grunting/growling noise each time the  rocks hit.<BR><BR>It seemed to sense our presence almost immediately and turned around and looked at us.  Then it quickly stood up and jumped across the creek in one motion.  I remember thinking \"nothing can move like that!\".  It ran up the slope on the north side of the creek bed at an angle and disappeared into the pine and aspen trees farther up the hill.  We could see it for about 50 feet before it was gone from sight.  It moved real quietly for something that big.<BR><BR>I estimate it''s height as 6''5''''.  It was covered with long dark brown hair that made me think of a yak.  It had a strong smell, at least there was a strong smell in the area that was like elk urine.<BR><BR>After we calmed down a bit, we went into the creek bed and found the 2 rocks which were chipped and broken.  We looked for other signs in that place but couldn''t find anything else." 1, " I was working in the northern part of New Mexico training to be a Wildland Fire Fighter. In September 2003 (maybe the second week of that month) I was dispatched with 22 other people to the Del Loma Fire in the Shasta/Trinity Forest area, the Northern part of California. Each Crew had about 20 people, our plane that left Albuquerque held 2 crews. For almost the whole two weeks, we were all on standby. On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire. It was close to sun down when, a couple of guys were amazed at something. I heard them from inside my tent, but just ignored the whole thing until one of my crew members came and pulled me out of my tent. <BR><BR>I had no idea what I was supposed to be looking at or for. He pointed across the river and I was in shock when he pointed out the biggest, hairiest mammal I had ever seen just walking along the river side minding his own business. It stopped and looked at us. The way he stood on his hind legs was like an ordinary human. He had dark, long hair and stood about 7ft tall with a muscular build. <BR><BR>At this point I was the 4th person standing there in amazement. Maybe about 5 minutes of watching him watch us, with more people coming out with flashlights (because the sun was still going down) he darted in to the trees. He was running, taking long strides, and was gone in about 3 seconds.....and was literally pushing trees out of his way (not breaking them, but  pushing them out of his way). The trees behind him on his path up the mountain were swaying back and forth. I was surprised to see to these trees moving because they are thick in width and very tall. <BR><BR>By this time it was dark but lit enough to see which way he was headed. Up the mountain a little, there was a clearing, where we spotted him again before he disappeared for good. He made no noise, no yelling or screaming.

There was snow on the ground and it was freezing outside.  My mother has a habit of looking out the bathroom window early in the morning.  On this cold winter morning, with the landscaped dressed in a blanket of white and without any visible signs of being touched by human or animal footprints, she saw what looked like 3 very large humanoid footprints. It was so strange that my mother made me get up to take a look.  We put our coats on and went outside to investigate.  We couldn''t believe our eyes.  There in the snow were 3 very, very large humanoid footprints.  We couldn''t figure out where they came from or where they went.  It literally looked as it came from no where and went no where, because the footprints did not leave a trail.  The footprints were so large I could almost stand in it.  You could literally see the 5 toes with foot and toe imprints in the snow.  We couldn''t believe what we were seeing.  Who or what has a foot that big and who or what would be out in this weather barefooted.<BR><BR>" 1, " April 29 2006 about 630pm I just left the Livingston mall and was heading home but got all turned about since I don''t go up that way very often. Anyhow I was figuring that I was north of rt 78 and just kind of \"Lewis and Clarked\" it toward home via the mirror compass in my car and made the first left southbound that I could once I realized I was heading west and didn''t recognize any landmarks. <BR><BR>I turn down this road and notice some construction equipment not far off into the trees on the right side of the road. I was driving slower than normal being unfarmiliar with the area and since I kept peeking at the compass to make sure I was still southbound (looking back it must have been overcast since I would have just used the location of the sun as a reference to direction).<BR>As I was driving along I caught movement out of the corner of my eye and saw a young deer (judging by size) bolt out of the trees across the road from left to right about 100-200 feet in front of my car. I just took my foot off the gas and didn''t need to brake, then I looked left for followers and saw what appeard to be a hunter in a dark colored ghillie suit burst from the trees after the deer. I couldnt make out any details of the face feet or hands but he/it was only around 6 feet tall or so and I''d estimate the low 200lb range but was unusually fast especially for someone dressed like that. The second thought in my head since I fish and shoot a bit was that it couldn''t possibly be legal to hunt around that area since its fairly close to residential zones. Then I noticed that the hunter had no weapons in his hands. I got up to the spot where they crossed and looked right and noticed that the biped (hunter) actually closed ground on the deer and was still in pursuit. I don''t know if the deer stopped to look back at some point as they some times do but this thing was in a full tilt sprint over what I would assume to be uneven ground and didn''t stumble once. I didn''t hear or smell anything since I had my roof up and AC & radio on at the time.

I walk, it walks ( and I know the difference between a deer and a person). I feel like something moves when I do. If I sit down for two to three hours, something moves around out there. Never find tracks. I have hunted for many years all over. I leave it at that. If their is something like a cleaver ape, it may travel along the Mississippi bottom land country. Its thick, swampy, and no one  goes there except to maybe hunt snakes, ducks, or deer. It is wet, thick and the Magilliary is where I would go if I wanted to stay out of sight, especially when hunting season starts. Thats when I have heard what ever it was. It stayed with me twice.

This track was well defined and I would say  made earlier that day. I looked around further and found another track. This one was barely definable, but there the same.

cold, early winter morning.  There was snow on the ground and it was freezing outside.  My mother has a habit of looking out the bathroom window early in the morning.  On this cold winter morning, with the landscaped dressed in a blanket of white and without any visible signs of being touched by human or animal footprints, she saw what looked like 3 very large humanoid footprints. It was so strange that my mother made me get up to take a look.  We put our coats on and went outside to investigate.  We couldn''t believe our eyes.  There in the snow were 3 very, very large humanoid footprints.  We couldn''t figure out where they came from or where they went.  It literally looked as it came from no where and went no where, because the footprints did not leave a trail.  The footprints were so large I could almost stand in it.  You could literally see the 5 toes with foot and toe imprints in the snow.  We couldn''t believe what we were seeing.  Who or what has a foot that big and who or what would be out in this weather barefooted.<BR><BR>" 1, " April 29 2006 about 630pm I just left the Livingston mall and was heading home but got all turned about since I don''t go up that way very often. Anyhow I was figuring that I was north of rt 78 and just kind of \"Lewis and Clarked\" it toward home via the mirror compass in my car and made the first left southbound that I could once I realized I was heading west and didn''t recognize any landmarks. <BR><BR>I turn down this road and notice some construction equipment not far off into the trees on the right side of the road. I was driving slower than normal being unfarmiliar with the area and since I kept peeking at the compass to make sure I was still southbound (looking back it must have been overcast since I would have just used the location of the sun as a reference to direction).<BR>As I was driving along I caught movement out of the corner of my eye and saw a young deer (judging by size) bolt out of the trees across the road from left to right about 100-200 feet in front of my car. I just took my foot off the gas and didn''t need to brake, then I looked left for followers and saw what appeard to be a hunter in a dark colored ghillie suit burst from the trees after the deer. I couldnt make out any details of the face feet or hands but he/it was only around 6 feet tall or so and I''d estimate the low 200lb range but was unusually fast especially for someone dressed like that. The second thought in my head since I fish and shoot a bit was that it couldn''t possibly be legal to hunt around that area since its fairly close to residential zones. Then I noticed that the hunter had no weapons in his hands. I got up to the spot where they crossed and looked right and noticed that the biped (hunter) actually closed ground on the deer and was still in pursuit. I don''t know if the deer stopped to look back at some point as they some times do but this thing was in a full tilt sprint over what I would assume to be uneven ground and didn''t stumble once. I didn''t hear or smell anything since I had my roof up and AC & radio on at the time.

My mother was napping, my father was at work (he helped farm there on the land--they lived in a trailer on the about 350 acres owned by their landlord). <BR>I was sitting on the front porch with my son and my parent''s dog, Buddy. It was mid-afternoon, probably between 1 and 3 pm. I noticed something or someone walking in the field connected to the front yard coming in our direction. My first instinct was to get my baby and get inside. However, I could not help but stand in the doorway, screen door closed but the wooden door open just enough for me to peer through. Whatever that thing was, it kept coming closer to the trailer. By this time, Buddy (the dog) was timidly barking. I could tell from his bark that he was threatened but afraid. I felt bad leaving the dog out on the porch alone, but was too afraid to go out there. <BR>The thing (for lack of a known word to call what it was that I saw)was walking, on two legs, aimlessly, not in a hurry and I could not find a reason as to why it came into the yard as it was just looking around aimlessly and leisurely walking. There was a wooden fence, mostly for decoration and only about 20 feet long, that the thing walked next to. My mother had some decorations (can''t remember what) hanging on the fence that the thing seemed to look at. <BR>The dog barking did not startle the creature, it just kept walking. <BR>I was absolutely astounded by what I was seeing; if not for the fact that the dog was seeing it too, I would have wondered if my eyes and/or brain was playing tricks on me. I decided to be brave and opened the screen door just enough to stick my head outside. That''s when the thing looked at me, met my gaze. I just stood there, half afraid of it''s reaction and it''s next move but more curious than anything. My heart was racing. I held my son up to look at it also, still indoors. After it looked at me and yet showed no fear I had more time to study it and I was racking my brain to identify what it was that I was seeing. <BR>Here is the best description I can give...It was between 4-6 feet tall, walking on two legs, covered from head to toe in very long white hair. It''s face was mostly covered in white hair as well, except for it''s eyes and maybe it''s mouth. It did not have the snout like a dog, it''s shape and build was that of a human''s. I even compared it to a bear in my head, but their were not enough similarities. This thing was not very animalistic in behavior--the way it walked and looked at me were more typical of human behaviors. Yet, the way it wandered and seemed oblivious to the man-made things around it (cars, the trailer, even the fence) was more like the characteristics of an animal. I did not get the feeling that it was aggressive or wanting to cause harm. Yet, because of the size and animalistic nature of it, I knew that it was strong and could hurt me, my son, or the dog.<BR>It began to walk around the side of the garage, out of my sight, but closer towards the end of the trailer that had the bedroom my mom was napping in. I ran down into the bedroom and began frantically looking out the windows searching to see where it had gone. i woke my mother up in my tizzy and quickly told her what I had seen and I wanted her to look. She was still half-asleep and slow to process what I was saying.<BR>I did not see where it went from there. I could not locate it through the windows and I was much too afraid to go outside and look.<BR>My mom, my son, and I all sat and talked about what I had seen that afternoon. I was still shook up about it. My son was able to confirm to my mother that it was not a dog, not a bear. The fact that we both saw and heard that dog barking at it helped to convince my mom that it wasn''t a human or another dog, bear, etc.<BR>My mom said that people down the road have two big white dogs--but like I told her, this thing was walking on two legs, not on all fours like a dog. For many other reasons, I knew it was not a dog. I''d never seen a bear in real life before, but I am sure it was not a bear either. I had heard of and seen animated Yetis on a pc game before. That was the closest thing I could match to what I had seen. I knew then and know now that many people do not believe Yetis are real--but whatever it was that I saw that day makes me wonder if they are in fact real and if that is what I saw.<BR>I believe it was late summer when this happened. Nice weather, sunny day. Like I said, mid-afternoon and it was out in the open. There were clear farmlands all around us. One pond stocked with fish and swans right next to the end of the trailer that it went in the direction of. There were also two other ponds on the land. I know that a lot of the 350 acres was wooded. Also, there was a road about 300 feet from where the thing was and also from where I was. There was only about 150 feet between myself and the creature. I''m not good at mathematical estimations, but I was as close as I would have wanted to be to whatever that was. It looked as if it could have made about 10 strides to me in a very short amount of time, so I stayed inside.<BR>I''ve read a few of the other sightings here on your sight, but all that I have read are of people seeing creatures covered in dark brown or almost black long hair. That wasn''t the case with me. The description of the hair being that it was very long and covered the whole creature, not tangled, matted, or dissarrayed, but it was a blinding white color--didn''t even look dirty or yellowed. I wish I could remember its hands or feet, but I can''t. I can say that it''s eyes were bigger than that of a human''s and seemed very dark. Other than when we met each other''s gaze, it had it''s head looking down so I could not see it''s eyes or facial features well if at all. It did not make any noises at all. It hardly made any sounds while walking. <BR>This happened about 5 years ago and I have not forgotten it--never will forget it. In fact, my son still remembers seeing it as well. I told my dad about it when he got home--he couldn''t tell me what it was either, had not seen anything like that before. I''ve told my husband, my brother, some friends--no one can relate to what I saw or help me to name what it was. I often wish I could go back to that day and be less afraid and more willing to study it, to even sit outside and watch it instead of hiding inside. I doubt I will ever see anything like that again, and yet I don''t know if I really want to, lol.<BR>I hope this helps with your work in some way. I had no idea that there have been so many sightings of similar creatures in Missouri and in our country as a whole. I''m going to look through some more stories of sightings after I submit this--I''m curious to see if anyone else has reported a white creature before.<BR>It feels great to share my story with someone who might be able to tell me what it was that I saw that day--someone who might have seen something like this before themselves. Thanks, Amber." 1, " I was on my way home from town between 10:30 and 11:00 pm. As I was coming around the gravel road I received a message on my phone. As I opened my phone to check my message I seen a creature walking upright across the road. It stood about 6 to 6 and a half ft tall. I quickly started backing out of my messages trying to access my camera on my phone. At the time I first seen it, I was about 50 yards from it. By time I came to a stop I was within 25 to 30 yards from the creature. When I first seen it, the creature was in the middle of the road in the process of walking straight across the road. It wasn''t In a hurry, it calmly walked across the road and stopped about 5 ft. off the road still in sight. I was able to take a picture of it before it walked off into the woods. From the moment I seen it, it never took its eyes off me. I tried to switch my camera over to video but it was too late. It was gone. I was fortunate enough to take the picture I got before it was gone. That is definitely a night I will never forget.

It was late afternoon when we noticed a strong odor that we thought might be elk so we headed east toward a small ridge hoping to find one on the other side.  As we got closer we heard the noise of rocks being banged together.  As we topped the ridge we saw a large dark brown animal squatting at the edge of a dry creek bed with it''s back toward us. It was banging 2 rocks together with it''s \"hands\" and making a grunting/growling noise each time the  rocks hit.<BR><BR>It seemed to sense our presence almost immediately and turned around and looked at us.  Then it quickly stood up and jumped across the creek in one motion.  I remember thinking \"nothing can move like that!\".  It ran up the slope on the north side of the creek bed at an angle and disappeared into the pine and aspen trees farther up the hill.  We could see it for about 50 feet before it was gone from sight.  It moved real quietly for something that big.<BR><BR>I estimate it''s height as 6''5''''.  It was covered with long dark brown hair that made me think of a yak.  It had a strong smell, at least there was a strong smell in the area that was like elk urine.<BR><BR>After we calmed down a bit, we went into the creek bed and found the 2 rocks which were chipped and broken.  We looked for other signs in that place but couldn''t find anything else." 1, " I was working in the northern part of New Mexico training to be a Wildland Fire Fighter. In September 2003 (maybe the second week of that month) I was dispatched with 22 other people to the Del Loma Fire in the Shasta/Trinity Forest area, the Northern part of California. Each Crew had about 20 people, our plane that left Albuquerque held 2 crews. For almost the whole two weeks, we were all on standby. On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire. It was close to sun down when, a couple of guys were amazed at something. I heard them from inside my tent, but just ignored the whole thing until one of my crew members came and pulled me out of my tent. <BR><BR>I had no idea what I was supposed to be looking at or for. He pointed across the river and I was in shock when he pointed out the biggest, hairiest mammal I had ever seen just walking along the river side minding his own business. It stopped and looked at us. The way he stood on his hind legs was like an ordinary human. He had dark, long hair and stood about 7ft tall with a muscular build. <BR><BR>At this point I was the 4th person standing there in amazement. Maybe about 5 minutes of watching him watch us, with more people coming out with flashlights (because the sun was still going down) he darted in to the trees. He was running, taking long strides, and was gone in about 3 seconds.....and was literally pushing trees out of his way (not breaking them, but  pushing them out of his way). The trees behind him on his path up the mountain were swaying back and forth. I was surprised to see to these trees moving because they are thick in width and very tall. <BR><BR>By this time it was dark but lit enough to see which way he was headed. Up the mountain a little, there was a clearing, where we spotted him again before he disappeared for good. He made no noise, no yelling or screaming. He was just as timid as can be.<BR><BR>I have heard many stories about Bigfoot, and known that they are real but when seeing one in real life....you get a sense of respect for them and just have that feeling that there is more to life than you know. <BR><BR><BR><BR>" 1}, :cardinality 99}, :environment {:data-type "string", :distinct 449, :commons {nil 41, "Pine forest" 6, "Forest" 3}, :cardinality

There was snow on the ground and it was freezing outside.  My mother has a habit of looking out the bathroom window early in the morning.  On this cold winter morning, with the landscaped dressed in a blanket of white and without any visible signs of being touched by human or animal footprints, she saw what looked like 3 very large humanoid footprints. It was so strange that my mother made me get up to take a look.  We put our coats on and went outside to investigate.  We couldn''t believe our eyes.  There in the snow were 3 very, very large humanoid footprints.  We couldn''t figure out where they came from or where they went.  It literally looked as it came from no where and went no where, because the footprints did not leave a trail.  The footprints were so large I could almost stand in it.  You could literally see the 5 toes with foot and toe imprints in the snow.  We couldn''t believe what we were seeing.

Anyhow I was figuring that I was north of rt 78 and just kind of \"Lewis and Clarked\" it toward home via the mirror compass in my car and made the first left southbound that I could once I realized I was heading west and didn''t recognize any landmarks. <BR><BR>I turn down this road and notice some construction equipment not far off into the trees on the right side of the road. I was driving slower than normal being unfarmiliar with the area and since I kept peeking at the compass to make sure I was still southbound (looking back it must have been overcast since I would have just used the location of the sun as a reference to direction).<BR>As I was driving along I caught movement out of the corner of my eye and saw a young deer (judging by size) bolt out of the trees across the road from left to right about 100-200 feet in front of my car. I just took my foot off the gas and didn''t need to brake, then I looked left for followers and saw what appeard to be a hunter in a dark colored ghillie suit burst from the trees after the deer. I couldnt make out any details of the face feet or hands but he/it was only around 6 feet tall or so and I''d estimate the low 200lb range but was unusually fast especially for someone dressed like that. The second thought in my head since I fish and shoot a bit was that it couldn''t possibly be legal to hunt around that area since its fairly close to residential zones. Then I noticed that the hunter had no weapons in his hands. I got up to the spot where they crossed and looked right and noticed that the biped (hunter) actually closed ground on the deer and was still in pursuit. I don''t know if the deer stopped to look back at some point as they some times do but this thing was in a full tilt sprint over what I would assume to be uneven ground and didn''t stumble once.

We were moving slowly through very thick brush when we heard a noise ahead of us. Some sort of animal was stepping away, we thought it might be a deer, until it turned around and looked at us. It was so dark that night, you couldnt see your hand in front of your face. But when this animal turned to look at us, it eyes were bright fluorescent green, illuminated like flashlights! We could tell we were in a large flat area, and these bright green eyes were taller than we were, 7-8 feet off the ground, and about 50-60 feet away. My friend and I had hunted for years together, and we both felt comfortable in the woods. But all of a sudden we both got a bad feeling, and we felt very uncertain about what this animal actually was.<BR>We decided to go to our left as we knew a lake was not far away, and maybe we could get more light off the water to see. Thats when the animal started to follow us. When we reached the lake, (there was a faint light coming off the water), but not enough to see up in the forest. The animal had followed us, but had stopped just inside the darkness of the trees about 150 feet away, (at the top of a logging road), bright illuminated green eyes was all you could see.<BR>We were young, confident and very sure of ourselves as young men in our early 20s. So we were embarrassed that it was scaring us, and after discussing it, decided to charge it. We explained to each other, that when it runs from us, we will get a better understanding of what type of animal it is. So we grabbed some large branches as clubs, smashed them against a large boulder, (and took off running up the logging road at it), yelling like you would if herding cattle. As we ran, we knew it would run sooner or later, it wouldnt want to risk confrontation with two angry humans. We ran right up into the darkness of the forest, (within 30-40 feet of the animal), and it didnt move a muscle. It just stood there, staring at us, with those bright green eyes. We suddenly were petrified, we could feel its presence very close to us. At that point we knew, it was not a bear, mountain lion, elk, or any normal creature we were familiar with. It was something new. It was not afraid of us at all. We were so terrified, we felt if we turned our backs on it, it might attack us. So we dropped out clubs, held each other promising not to run, and slowly walked backwards.<BR>As we walked along the beach next to the water, it followed us back to the truck, staying just in the edge of the darkness of the trees. When we finally reached the pickup, it had rained heavily, and the truck was stuck in the mud. As we rocked the truck back and forth, we thought the creature was going to look in the windows of the truck, or stand in front of it, so we could not look out the windows. We finally got the truck unstuck and headed down the road back home. Both of us were so terrified, we didnt speak to anyone about it for several years, thinking no one would believe us.<BR>Heres where the story gets unbelievable. About 10 years later, when I felt comfortable talking about it, I told a friend of mine that had a ranch about 5 miles from the encounter location. As I told him this story, his eyes lit up, he seemed to believe every word I said!<BR>When I was finished, he then explained the very same thing happened to his father, in the same location 40 years earlier! His father and his uncle were checking trap lines in the mountains, when they were young boys, and got caught in a storm and it was very dark. As they got off the trail, they came across a very large log laying on the ground and decided to walk down it to get through some heavy brush. As they walked down the log together, just as they were going to climb down, the log lifted them both up in the air! As they looked back, a very large blackhairy creature with very bright green eyes, had stepped up on the log behind them! They were so terrified, they dropped all of their traps, and ran several miles back to the ranch, soaking wet and scared to death.<BR>Until that day, I couldnt believe what happened to my friend and I that dark fall evening. But when I heard my ranch friend tell me about his fathers experience, I knew what happened to us was for real.<BR> <BR>Local resident, wish to stay anonymous.<BR>McCall Idaho" 1, " I was driving down a logging road, passing a J hole in the road. To my left BF caught my eye as it started to slide down the embankment, on its feet. Standing up, almost sking. I turned toward him, following him in my pickup, as close as his arm reach. Im not a journalist, so if someone would care to call me about this I would be more than happy to describe my encounter. I had a great view of him for 20 to 30 seconds, walking along side then in front on my pickup.      " 1, " I was a reserve deputy sheriff for Story co. Sheriff''s office. I was employed by Houston International Minerals Corp. at Gold Hill as their on site security supervisor. I had worked the day shift. I had ran some kids out of the old mill at around 3:30pm on 09-15-80. I was showing my swing shift officer the area I had ran the kids off from. We were in the security vehicle parked on the high side of the southside of the old mill (Gold Mining). We saw that the boys, (four of them) were running back down the ravine to the creek below. it was 4:15pm. As the boys reached the creek they must have scared a group of girls at the creek bottom because they started screaming. there was a lot of noise being made by both the girls, and boys laughing, and yelling. At first I thought they had scared a deer west of them near the rock outcrops. Then I thought, no it''s too big to be a deer. I could see it moving amoung the trees heading up the other side of the ravine at a very fast pace. I thought it must be a lone mustang as I watched. My secutity officer got the binoculars from the seat and said \"OH MY GOD\" I looked closer, and realized it was not a mustang. I was looking at a large greying/ brown man shape thing about ten plus feet tall. It was obviously male. because of it''s build. As it cleared the trees near the top of the hill I could clearly see it. It was covered with hair from head to toe. Greying like a person in their fifties. It was at least three feet across at the shoulders. At the crest of the hill it turned to look back down the ravine. It was maybe a hundred yard across the ravine. I had an unobstructed view at this point. It stood on the hill top maybe a minute looking back down the hill, then turned and moved over the other side of the hill out of view. We drove over to where we had seen the thing last (about a two mile drive on dirt roads). It''s was about 4:50 pm by then  We saw no further sign of it, but was able to establish that the thing was standing next to a tree that was 11 feet tall, and it was just as tall as the tree we saw."
