Myself and a frind were fourwheeling on light, snow covered roads at about two am. we came around a corner and we both saw something run across the road.  it had very long, shagy red hair and it was running on all fours.  something like a gorilla would when charging.  we only observed it cross the road when we apperently spooked it.  we are both outdoorsman and have seen bears and the like befor.  when it happened, we both simultaneously looked at each other said \"what the hell was that?\" and then said \"we better not tell anyone or they''ll think were crazy!\"  I can''t swear to what it was, but I''ll swear it wasn''t a bear.  this thing was the wrong color to be any kind of cat and it was to thin through the torso as compared to its overall size to be a bear and i suspect bears would have already been in hybernation.  the hair looked like it could have been 18 inches long, very shagy.  its body shape was like a giant human, not a cat or bear.  unfortunately the animal never

or 14 miles above lake huntington. in the sierras. myself, my fishing pardner, and another gentleman, were all fishing a small part of the river there, it was the last weekend of the season, before they close the roads, due to snow. about 3 miles down the river, my pardner decided he had enough, and stop to nap. this other gentleman and myself pushed on, maybe 3/4 of mile from where we had left my friend. i stop to fish a pool. the other guy  dropped down to the next pool, to fish it, that is how we were working the differant areas. 1 guy would stop to fish a hole and the other would go right down below. as i was fishing my little stretch, i noticed the guy coming back up, he looked very excited and was waving for me to come there, i figured that he landed a good fish, or had seen a bear. he was almost in a frenzy, he just told me to hurry when i caught up to him he was looking over the edge of the next little drop off, i looked over and saw nothing unusual, he said it was right there, and jumped his way down to the spot, i followed, asking him what he had seen. before i could even get the words out of my mouth this smell, i cant explain to you what it was, wet, moldy, well animal, musk filled the air, nothing i have smelled ever was like this. my friend then told me that he had seen it, again before i could even ask above us i saw it, there standing no more then i would say 25 yards up the hill, was a the creature i believe to be a bigfoot. about 8 foot tall, covered in a reddish brown, and some what black hair, the face i remember it looking almost humanoid in appearance. it then turned and began taking huge strides up the mountain, not running, but covering some serious ground.on 2 feet. not 4. i tried to follow it, but again i felt an almost hynotic sensation over take me, and my pardner later told me he felt the same way, and  i couldnt move, we watched it go right up to the top and over it. i felt very over whelmed, and did not say anything to my friend, we just walk in a silence back to our other friend, he could tell we were shooken up. but never let him in on what had just occured. to this day, when ever i think about it, i get overwelmed with emotion. when i got home i called the gentleman and talked to him about what we had seen, the feelings we went through were basically the same, when he saw the creature he said he could smell the smell i described, but not nearly as bad as when we came down to where it had been standing. then a strange feeling over took him as well, almost like we were hypnotized, or drugged. he has trouble now remembering what he looked liked, he can remember seeing it and the smell, but all other memeories are fading. i can tell you , i will never forget what he looked like, and have came to my own conclusions, i believe the smell the bigfoot emits can be used as sort of a defense system, let me explain, i believe when excited or scared the aroma he emits can actually work on a persons system, maybe for one, it makes you feel drugged, or for another it makes you feel hypnotized or just plain scared. the reason i feel this way, is like i said to this day, when i think about it, i am over come with emotion., i hope this might help in some small way, thank you for your time.", :environment "small river winding down a steep, hilling, rocky, wooded canyon", :fixed_year

Joaquin River in what would be the northwestern part of town. Actually in Fresno. The area is mostly farm land and some sparse woods and vineyards. nothing like foresty though. My self, my cousin and a friend had decided to go late night fishing at a little area on the river where the river sort of pools. Their is a bridge there. It was late and we were sitting there and fishing when we heard something making noise and looked back and saw a coyote running across the bridge heading north. The coyote kept looking back as it ran as if it was frightened.The coyote looked at us but it was clearly focused on something behind it and it was scared. We thought at that time that that was odd. We then heard what we thought was a splash as if someone had dove into the water behind us. It was dark so we just glanced back but of course saw nothing. We probably sat for about 10 minutes or so when suddenly there was a huge goosh and splash about 25 yards away in front of us. We stopped fishing and then tried looking into the darkness.This small boulder throwing continued at least 2 more times before we actually saw a dark figure about 40 yards away standing what looked about waist high in the river. Their was a full moon so it wasn''t to dark to see that it was a pretty big creature. By this time we were starting to get scared and were pretty much froze in place and had began to yell at it, thinking that it could be a person. This prompted my friend to yell threats of violence as young people are sometime prone to do, this creature basically turned it''s whole body to the right of it and grapped another boulder and with both hands over its head it threw it at us, this one landed about 15 yards away. It made no sound or noise only threw small boulders. It threw about 2 more boulders the last landing about 5 yards from us enough to splash water on our faces. By this time we had reeled in our lines and were trying to get out of there as fast as we could. We ran all the way back to the car which was through some trees across a field and up a hill. We went back the next day to the area and on rafts floated to the area where the creature had stood. My friend is about 6 foot tall and jumped in the water to see about how deep it was. The water came to his shoulders. Their was no way this was a man. We even saw some of the boulders that had been thrown at the bottom of the water as it wasn''t more then 5 1/2 feet deep.

I was stationed at Beale AFB, Ca., and I would always drive around looking for the next great fishing hole.  I had been driving for quite some time and had decided to pull into Humboldt Redwood State Park.  Being from Alabama, I figured seeing these big redwoods would be kind of cool. <BR><BR> So, I got off of Hwy 101 and took the Avenue of the Giants exit.  Driving down the road I was amazed at the size of the trees, so they kind of grabbed my attention. I started seeing a lot of places where I was thinking I could fish, so I started to slow down even more to find a place to park.  As I kept driving the river kind of started getting a little farther away, and I was about to turn around. <BR><BR>When out of no where something walked across the road, and to say the least it shocked the you know what out of me.  The reason why it got me a little jumpy was because of the fact that I had to have come within a couple of feet of this thing.  Now I''m a pretty big guy 6'' and about 220 Lbs., but what ever walked in front of my truck had to have been over 7 feet tall, due to the height of the truck (Chevy Z71). <BR><BR>Now when it comes to the poundage of this thing I would have to say it was well over 350 lbs.  As far as physical features all I saw was the back and arm swing. The thing never turned around for me to get a better look at it.  But it had a large back and rather long arms.  As far as the neck goes it didnt really have one.  The animals traps made it look like it didnt have a neck.  Kind of like me.  <BR><BR>But after I did find a place to turn around, I went back to look around, dumb I know, to say the least.  I only found a couple of tracks. They had to have been 14 to 15 inches long, plus the stride of this thing was a lot longer then mine. Just to make the stride this thing did, I had to make one heck of an effort.  Now all I can say is what ever I saw that day was nothing like anything I had ever seen in the woods, and I grew up in the outdoors.<BR>", :environment "The area was pretty thick with redwoods and undergrowth and the river was to my right.", :fixed_year "2003", :run_time "2022-05-20 16:14:27.000000"} {:nearestroad "Highway 101", :date nil, :locationdetails "Going north on 101, take 254, and once you turn onto 254, off to the left, I pulled in and parked.", :submitted_date "2003-12-06", :sketch 0, :bfroid 7504, :otherwitnesses "just one", :run_id 34, :nearesttown "Myers Flat", :styler_highlight_1797 0, :timeandconditions "It was early afternoon, and the light conditions where poor due to the rain.", :month "0001-05-01", :county "Humboldt County", :state "California", :fixed_month "0001-05-01", :submitted "2003-12-06 00:00:00.000000", :title "Fisherman has a second encounter on a rainy afternoon, as a upright animal moves from a streambed.", :otherstories "No", :year "2003", :season "Spring", :class "Class A", :alsonoticed "The only thing that i found unusual was when the creature was spooked.

I had been coming to this area for the past couple of months and started to learn it a little better.  So I decided to go exploring for some fishing holes.  All I had with me at the time was a fishing rod and a GPS receiver so I wouldnt get lost. <BR><BR> I parked the truck and started out on foot. I had talked to two local fishermen about what was in these rivers, and what to use. Im from the south and this area was like a new world.  So I made my way down to the river along the side of the bank.  At times the going got a little hard but I managed.  I tried several places but the water was moving too fast, so I thought that I would try and find a slack part of the river, where the flow was a little slower.  Now these woods are a lot different than the ones I was used to, so I was a little excited about this new area.<BR><BR> I had been walking for maybe 45 minutes and covered maybe two miles when I saw something in the distance.  At first I thought that it was just a stump, seeing that I had left my glasses in the truck.  Now my vision isnt that bad, but I still need them for driving.  But, I started feeling a little uneasy due to an earlier encounter, plus it might have been a bear. <BR><BR>But, being the idiot that I am, I had to get closer.  I got to within about 75 yards, because I was using the tree line as cover. That was as close as I wanted to get.  You could say that my heart was beating out of my chest it was like I had buck fever.  Well now that I was within good sight of the creature. It was easy to see what it was.  It finally stood up, and I didnt know up until that point how big it really was.  <BR><BR>Now, I had a roommate who was 6''7 and this creature would have easily stood over him.  At the best guess I would have to say that it was 7''6 tall, and it had to weigh over 400lbs.  It finally turned to me and made me out in a second, but when it turned, it didnt run away instantly.  It just stood there.  I guess it was trying to see what I was. We must have looked at each other for 10 seconds or so, but it felt like 10 minutes. And in that time all I could see was that the creature had dark reddish brown hair, and the arms easily hung down to the creatures knees. <BR><BR>But within an instant something spooked it. The creature turned and looked down river, and it just took off.  Now the ground that this thing covered was amazing.  I didnt move for a good bit, because I was in shock.  After the creature had left, I did the same, once I could get my feet working again. <BR>", :environment "Slack part of a creek, with thick woods all around.", :fixed_year "2003", :run_time "2022-05-20 16:14:27.000000"} {:nearestroad "Bald Hills Road", :date "27th", :locationdetails "from 101 past Orick about one mile turn right at Lady Bird Johnson Grove (AKA Bald Hills Road).

This area we were in had a sighting last year around the month of July.   <BR><BR>The place where we decided to set up was a recent clear-cut that ran along the hillside.   It was about 1000 feet wide and 1200 feet long.   On the edges were fir and oak trees that developed  a thick cover.   Running the width and centered in the clear-cut was a dirt road that the local people and loggers used on a daily basis.   It also provided us with a place to park and set up our sound equipment.   it also became base for our team.   <BR><BR>From our base, looking down into the valley about two miles we could see the town of Johnson.   From or point we were about 1500 feet above the river and town.   <BR><BR>Just prior to dusk, I had two members climb to the top of the clear-cut (about 150 feet in elevation and about 300 feet away from base).   I did this so if anything was to come closer to our base camp, they would have the best field of vision, and with their night vision device would be able to determine what it was.   We also had two way potable radios for the upper lookout and base.<BR><BR>Manny and myself continued to set up the equipment and waited until nightfall. <BR><BR>Because I was scheduled to participate at 10:00 PM in a live broadcast with Jeff Rense &#8220;Sightings&#8221; program, I was insuring that my bag cell phone was working properly.   All the equipment checked out other than the phone worked but had some static in the line.<BR><BR>At 9:40 we started to broadcast.   The sound traveled very well, and seemed to echo forever.   The location we were at easily helped the sound to travel well over five miles from valley to ridge top, and saddle, it covered a large area.   Very happy with the sound, we continued to broadcast a few more times before the Sightings show started.<BR><BR>It was almost 10:00 PM when the phone rang, it was the Sightings show.   The show went fine for the first few minutes, but the static was getting horrendous, cutting Jeff Rense off completely at times.   About ten minutes into this show, Jeff asked me to try and find another location where the reception might be a little better.   A commercial was playing at the time so I quickly contacted the upper team and Manny and told then that I had to move.   I started my vehicle and drove about 600 feet towards the tree line.  I reconnected to the show and was relived that it was a better connection.   <BR><BR>I was in this new location less than 15 feet to the tree line, with visibility not over 5 feet into the trees.   I was parked for a few minutes and heard what I thought was a bear charging me (I am in a convertible) with the window down, not much protection in anyone&#8217;s mind.     I looked for my revolver and it was gone, I must have forgot it with Manny when I was in a hurry to get into a better location!   I sat there for a second, and again I heard this charging, that sounded like a few feet away from me.   This time I started my car got on the radio and told the upper team that I was moving out because of something charging me in the bush.   (Manny didn&#8217;t have a radio, as we were together at base camp and had to share two, one for base and one for the upper team).<BR><BR>I asked the upper team &#8220;do you see anything&#8221; and they replayed no.   I decided to wait it out, as this thing could expose itself to me (although I just realized that my camera was also with Manny).<BR><BR>The show continued on and I would hear footfalls, breaking branches and at least one grunt growl.   I kept asking the upper team if they could see anything and they kept saying no.    I at least had a flashlight, but didn&#8217;t want to use it in fear that I would scare off whatever it was. <BR><BR>Obviously I was becoming very concerned for my safety, not knowing what it was.   But I remained there on a chance I might be able to see a Bigfoot or at least see something.   I heard the charging again and again and finally a crackle in the radio  &#8220;John it&#8217;s looking right at you, can&#8217;t you see it, it&#8217;s about 25 feet away, that ****** is huge&#8221;.   My heart started pounding FAST, and trying to carry on with this live program without sounding distracted was even harder.   <BR><BR>The other upper team member confirmed what they were looking at, it was something that was at least 8 feet tall with shoulders that were 4 feet across.   As I sat in my car, cell phone to one ear, and the other to the forest, I could hear it charge again, and that&#8217;s when they would say, &#8220;it went back into the trees&#8221;, this happened several times.  This sighting went on for several minutes, with the Squatch looking at me by moving its body from side to side trying to get a better look through the trees and brush.   It was also observed moving its arms in a quick motion as if signaling to others.<BR><BR>This whole incident from the first charge heard to the last tree branch breaking, lasted about 30 minutes.   It was by far the one of the most intense moments in my life.<BR><BR>That next day we did search the area and found the soil disturbed where this Squatch was spotted.  Due to the soil condition, it did not allow any prints to be left.   Judging from a tree and stump in the area, it was determined that it was at least eight feet tall but closer to nine feet.   From the Squatches point of view, it had several windows to look at me, and by moving its body from side to side it would have a clear view of my entire vehicle and me.<BR><BR><BR>You can listen to this event by going to sightings.com and clicking on archived shows.

Coincidentally, our encounter occurred that same evening.<BR><BR>At approximately 9:30 p.m., we were in the process of setting up our second tent (there were six of us in the party), and maintaining the campfire when from directly across the road and meadow we heard a type of \"whistle\" or double \"whoop\" (try whistling these syllables \"WEEOOOU, WEEOOOU\") and it was immediately followed by a very intense \"screech\", which I could only compare to a bear cub in danger combined with the intensity of a hawk shriek. One of our younger members (15) insists it sounded like a possessed woman! <BR><BR>Now, I grew up in the mountains of Montana, am familiar with many animals and their sounds, and have never heard anything like this in my life. And until this moment, I have wondered what it was like to have the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. I have never felt this kind of reaction, I repeat -- NEVER. <BR><BR>The sound sequence repeated itself again, followed by a third lone screech. Immediately, we panned the forest/tree line with our flashlights with the intent of at least seeing the reflection of an animal''s eyes. NOTHING. We must have lighted the area for nearly ten minutes following the sound and still saw nothing. As time wore on, we began to relax and go about our business of finishing the tent set-up and dinner. <BR><BR>Then at about 12:30 a.m. (just past midnight, with two of the teenagers already asleep), we again heard the \"whistle - whoop\" immediately followed by the \"screech\", but this time directly BEHIND our camp site up the slope near the picnic areas amongst the trees. Again, we panned the area with lights (I broke out the 2,000,000 candlepower gangbuster spotlight and lit the night ) and still, NOTHING. No movement, no eyes, nothing. After panning around the entire area once again, I noticed movement on the road towards the restrooms and we quickly moved the light in that direction. Walking across the road was a tiny little grey fox, or kit fox. Well, for our needs, that was our mystery animal. (We THOUGHT). We figured it yelped and then made that raucous screech for some other reason. Funny, but that was enough confirmation for us and we went to bed for the night.<BR><BR>At approximately 5:30 a.m., three of us woke at the same time and after a minute or two of silence we again heard the \"whistle - whoop\" followed immediately by the intense \"screech\" and this followed again by a lone \"screech\". But, this time the sound was only about 20 feet from our tent as if it was standing directly on the paved road next to our camp site. We were all unnerved somewhat, but agreed it''s just that darn kit fox again, and didn''t bother to jump out with the video cameras or spotlights. I exchanged words with a person in the other tent (not sure if this \"chased\" it away), but we then heard the same \"whistle\" and \"screech\" again, but far off in the distance as if it were a quarter-mile away. This was the end of our encounter.<BR><BR>The following morning we checked the area for any signs of tracks and found nothing. We also nearly walked the entire circumference of the lake shore searching for signs of any kind and [got] nothing. Please note that we did not HEAR any movement in the brush or any footsteps. We did not SEE any movement or eyes of any kind and we did not SMELL anything at all. After hiking out of Fish Lake the next day, and driving back to the coast, we just didn''t feel right with our \"kit fox\" explanation. It just didn''t sit right with us.

I finally realized what it probably was and what it was doing. It had a human-like torso (from the waist up) and it appeared as if it was scratching its back against the stump. I gained a back and profile view before I could no longer overcome the intense fear I was experiencing. I urged my son as serious as could, to run as fast as he could.<BR><BR>After running for about thirty seconds to a minute, we stopped.

But, I wanted to catch another steele before the river blew out so, I drove down to the river bar as described in the \"Where did it occur?\" section of this report.  <BR><BR>I parked about 30 yards away from the rivers edge, on a dirt road surrounded by dense willows.  I turned off the car and opened the door.  Immediatly I heard two bellows that seemed far off.  I initially thought it was local kids.  The best I can do to discribe the noise is to ask you to try and make it--- put your lips togeather as if to make the sound of a \"B\" then bellow \"Whoooooooop\", wait two seconds and do it again. This is what I heard.  <BR><BR>To this day I can physically emulate the soud. The sound was similar to the bugle of a bull elk.  I used to work as a horse patrol park ranger on the eastern slope of the Rockies in Rocky Mountain National Park, I kept visitors away from the elk.  In addition, I have frequently heard elk bugle near Oric, CA. I know the bugle of an elk.  That''s not what this was.  <BR><BR>Well, I didn''t think much of it so I got my wadders on and proceeded to the rivers edge.  I wadded in up to my thigh and began fishing moving slowly down stream.  The river was probably about fifty yards wide and nearly at bank full about ten minutes went by and I noticed a dark figure down stream an accross the river, seemingly standing behind a large root wad.  I could see what I though was a head and shoulders of a bear or something? It was drizzeling and I couldn''t focus on it at first, I wasn''t sure it was an animal I thought it might just be part of the root wad.  <BR><BR>As I fished down stream I worked my way dirrectly accross from it and looked at it again, I looked right into its eyes, they were dark, it didn''t move. I then saw another to its left, I could see its body from <BR>the thigh up, it didn''t move, it was looking slightly down stream and I couldn''t see its eyes.  <BR><BR>These things looked taller than a man, had flat faces and large round eyes, their shoulders were broad and their arms were long, they were mostly covered in hair although the one on the left seemed to have bald spots on its chest area, like mange.  They stood still, never once moved.  Ikept fising and tried to work down stream of them to a tailout wher I could cross and sneek up on them to get a closer look, the river was to high.  <BR><BR>As I worked back upstream I noticed a cacoon shaped object perched on the root wad overhanging the rivers edge.  It was shaped like a foot ball but was probably 4 feet long and 21/2 feet in diameter (hard to tell at 50 yards).  This cacoon like thing appeared to be neetly wrapped in dry grasses like cat tail or pampas grass blades.  I kept fishing moving upstream of them back toward my car, at one point I looked back to get another look anfd the cacoon like thing and the animals were gone.  A day later I drove to the other side of the river to go see if I could track um but the river had flooded the entire area.  <BR><BR>I don''t follow Big Foot stuff, but I do know no bones have ever been found.  As a scintist this encounter has stimulated me to develope a theory.. I theorize that they warn eachother with this BWhooooop sound, and that the reason we have never found their bones is that they cleverly dispose of them by waiting till the rivers are on the rise, packaging the bones, and putting them in the rivers close to their mouths so that they wash out to sea.  I''m not sure I belive in any of this but thats what I saw and heard and thats my theory.  My second theory is that it was an elaborate hoax preformed by somm sort of Big Foot fan club or somthing.  But why would some one do that on an empty river bar I was the only one there and no one knew I was going to be there.<BR><BR>   ", :environment "The Mad River 100 year flood plane or riparian zone, within dense to scattered willows growing in the fairly flat and wide gravel deposits.", :fixed_year "1999", :run_time "2022-05-20 16:14:31.000000"} {:nearestroad "Hwy 101", :date nil, :locationdetails "On six hour loop trail for equines in the Redwood National Park, Orick", :submitted_date "2000-07-06", :sketch 0, :bfroid 2998, :otherwitnesses "Two others that I can remember.

We did notice however that a \"bear\" or something had an awfully good time with the outhouse toilet paper, as it was strung all over the place. We all were sitting there having lunch and I decided that I wanted to go see where the elk were, maybe see a big bull!

I was far ahead of my friends and decided to scare them as they came up the trail so I climbed up some rock cliffs for a better advantage and settled down within some Huckleberry bushes to wait for my friends.

My two friend were nowhere in sight.  I noticed a small movement in the berry bushes right behind me.  I stood up ready to run when this thing stood up also.

My name is J. C. and I am a 41 year old Vice President of a bank. I have been harboring an encounter I had for 31 years secretly out of fear of ridicule or shame. But now that I have seen other people have had similar situations, I must tell my story. During September 1972, I was hiking down from a lake with my dad and my friend on a fishing trip. We were at a place called Barney Lake out of Mammoth, California, and were on our way home. After a weekend of camping and fishing we were backpacking out from the lake. I was the lead person going down the trail. I had outpaced my friend J. C. and my dad by about 4 minutes without knowing it as I was moving quickly down the trail. After about 10 to 40 minutes down the trail from Barney Lake (I can''t remember exactly after all these years) I came into a clearing. It was a small flat grassy meadow from the trees which I had been seeing downhill till then. I took a break to rest from my fast strides and looked out over the meadow. The first thing I saw was a big white rock boulder near the end of the meadow. The meadow was maybe 20 yards by 30 yards of grass. At the point of the clearing to my left I heard extreme thrashing going on. I looked over to my left to see a large animal bent over with its rear end facing me. It was only about 12 feet away from me. I saw that it was hairy and had a reddish, orange, brown multicolor mix hair to it, and most different was a rear end that was bare like a monkey''s. I knew this because at this time in my life I spent most of my lunch hours in the library reading zoology and marine biology books. I thought this was very strange because no bear could bend over at the waist and have skin over its rear end like this. In my fear I was frozen, shocked and bewildered at the same time. I had never known or heard of big foot or sasquatch at this time in my life. At this point it had been maybe 5 or 6 seconds and then the animal lifted up and stood erect. It was enormous. It must have been 8 feet tall or more, and for a 10 year old boy this was unreal. It had been scratching with its hands and grubbing and digging prior to looking for what I thought was food. Its back was to me when it stood so I could see it was built similar to a human but with a lot of hair. I knew this was no bear from my background. I also knew only black bear were seen as an almost extinct species here during this time, and would have been much smaller in height and stature. I got so scared I ran full pack towards that big white rock. I literally dove over the top, pack and all, and snuggled against the rock, so scared to even look, in case the creature heard me. Finally after about 20 seconds or so, I peeked over the rock to see nothing and no one on the trail. Within 1 or 2 minutes, my dad and John came down the trail and into the opening. I started screaming at them \"look out, look out,\" in fear that the creature was still there and would do something to them. They froze,  bewildered, looked left to where I was pointing and then back to me in confusion. They were standing at the clearing at the spot I had been at. I finally came out and walked to them and looked into the trees and thick brush only to see broken brush, twigs and some hair there. We moved on finally and I never spoke of this again except to my dad and a couple of close friends. Around 7 or 8 years late I saw a couple of bigfoot movies including the Patterson video. Once I saw this, I knew without a doubt this was what I saw. I still kept my story a secret out of fear, but this vision haunts me and will all my life. I know it was so real. I will never forget this and take it to my grave. I am now someone who needs answers and must try and find out that this creature does exist or I will not put my memory to rest.

Having been there once before four years earlier with a church youth group, and consequently having had a blast, we wanted to camp in the same campground and generally do a lot of the things we had done on our first trip, but without the constraints of adult supervision. We where both twenty years old at this time. <BR><BR>We camped at a place called Lost Creek campground, which sits just inside Lassen National Park along its northern border with Lassen National Forest. On the second day we decided to take a late afternoon hike down an old somewhat overgrown logging road just on the other side of the national park/national forest boundary fence.  We knew of this road and its destination because we had hiked it four years earlier.  This road was lined with tree stumps, and had decades of old logging debris, and it had permanent tire grooves in the dirt.  As this road heads north down the slope from our campground it runs about 3000 ft., until it ends at a fire road running east to west.  We hiked west on this road about 100 yards to where the road runs along side a small meadow to the north. We hiked across this meadow to a creek called Lost Creek, hence the name of our camping site.<BR><BR>After soaking our feet in the icy water, my friend said we should probably head back up to camp as it was getting close to 7:00pm and he didn''t want too get stuck down there while it got dark.  We crossed the meadow back to the fire road and started walking east.  We then noticed on the road about 200 yards ahead of us, what at first glance appeared to be a large naked man with a dark complexion, walking away from us.  At second glance I thought maybe he isn''t naked but he''s wearing a fur coat with a pointy hood.  I remember saying to my friend \"take a look at this guy\". A few seconds later the figure stopped in its tracks and moved to the left side of the road, the whole time with its back to us.  I got the impression that he/it had noticed something and went to investigate.  A few seconds later it continued on its way with a very swift and deliberate gate, arms swinging slightly.<BR><BR>I think what sticks in my mind the most was the bawdiness of the shoulders.  In fact, I remember this character had a well defined hourglass figure.  He/it remained on the road for what seemed like a full minute, the entire time it was walking away from us, with his back to us. The more I watched the stranger I thought the situation was.  Eventually the figure disappeared from view, either around a bend in the road or up into forest to the left, I could not determine the direction.  We didn''t say too much about what we had just seen, however we seemed to walk a little more quickly back to camp.  I know I was a little nervous.  I can''t really put a size to this figure, because of the distance at which we viewed it, but if pressed, I would have to say it was over 6''5\" tall and about 270lbs., maybe even 300lbs. <BR><BR>The rest of the evening was uneventful, but the next morning at about 5:45am we both were awaken by what sounded to us, to be a series of powerful yelps and growls coming from the general direction of the area where we were hiking the day before.  I don''t know if any other campers in the area heard this. <BR><BR>My friend and I never really discussed this event among ourselves; or anyone else for several years, until for some reason, I brought it up once.  We still can''t come to an agreement on what we saw or heard.  I''ve told my wife about the incident, but very few others. I don''t know if my friend has told anyone.

A short distance north is Weott.  I have been a country girl all my life and have spent my life close to the land.  I had always been drawn to the forest and had slept outside when ever possible.  The weekends were made for pitching camp and swiming in the Rattlesnake Creek that runs along the foot of the property.  This time I wanted to spend the night along the side of the river by the deep pool we always swam in. The river has giant boulders to lay on and bask in the sun.  Both sides of the river are steep one side one side is so steep and gravel like you cant even climb it. <BR><BR>Well after much pleading with the people I had brought, they said ok we will camp on the river.  They were drinking a bit much and I was not going to touch it because I was worried they may decide to take a swim and sink.  We had fun with a small campfire we sat and laughed until it was late.  We rolled out our sleeping bags on the bank, the river at our feet and the steep cliff to our heads.  The spot we were in had a bit of a ledge high over our heads.I dont know what time it was when I woke up but I am a light sleeper and I heard the gravel over our heads being walked on. I lay still and listened.  It is moving across the top of the ledge toward my right. There is a deer trial that comes down to creek level about 10 feet away from where I am sleeping and I hear this person coming down it.  I was scared and tried to wake the people closest to me without making to much noise.  Then I kicked the person to my left and he snores louder.  <BR><BR>To my right, this person (I say person because it was two footed by the sound of it) was no more than 10 feet from me.  It stood behind a willow bush/baby tree it was really just 5 or six canes coming out of the stream bed.  It was dark but I could feel its size when it walked and shook the canes.  I kept thinking I am going to kill these @#% guys, why are they sleeping still? <BR><BR>Then the thing started yelling at me.  I know the sound of the animals in the California woods.  I have never heard this in my life.  It was yelling at us \"What the hell are you doing hear, this is my place.\"  It wasn''t like a mountain lion grawling and saying \"I''m tough and I can kick your [butt].\"  It was broken up into batches of sounds with inflections that I recognized. It was like a person speaking another language but you know they are telling you directly to get the hell out of my house.<BR><BR>I could see glimpses of it when its body moved into the light of the river.  Its right side was as tall as the canes I knew to be 8 foot-ish.  It ranted and raved and stomped and shook the bush.  I smelled skunk and thought \"Great this is all I need, they will bury me without a funeral because I am going to stink.\" I finally got my voice and said \"Ok Ok its alright ok ok .\" I did not see or hear it leave.  But I realized at some point it had left.  My encounter lasted only a few minutes but it felt much longer.  I stayed awake the rest of the night and I was so mad in the morning at my fellow campers.

It will help explain the delay in ever having reposted this incident. The sighting occurred about three months prior to my entering the United States Army. I served for three years as a Paratrooper with a Top Secret Clearance. After my time in the service, I became a Los Angeles Police officer. I did that for thirteen years and am now a Federal Agent, working for an O.I.G. out of Washington DC. With that background, you can probably understand my reluctance to discuss this sighting with too many people. It really boils down to a potential career killer. <BR><BR>That being said the incident DID occur and I remember it vividly. Many many years after the event, I reconnected with my friend (the witness) and asked him to tell ME the story as he recalled it. I wanted to check my memory and see if his matched mine. It did. To a T! Only a few months ago, I spoke with my brother in law, a witness after the fact. I asked him if he remembered the event. He did. It should be known that he is not the kind of person that would \"buy into\" such a story, had he not been semi involved. <BR><BR>Anyway, this is what happened: My friend Craig and I were both 17 years old and waiting to leave for Army Basic Training. He was due to leave in June and I would go in August of 1980. We were staying with my Sister and Brother in Law at the time. They lived in a cabin in Green Valley California. Craig and I enjoyed our last months as civilians in that area, and used it to train for the difficult training ahead of us. We ran every day along the mountain roads and hiked the hills, trying to get into prime shape. <BR><BR>In May, we decided to test ourselves and camp out for a full seven days. We knew the perfect place for this would be what we called \"The old campground\" because of its isolated surroundings and terrain that would be perfect for climbing and hiking. So, we packed up a weeks worth of supplies and, though my sister Cindy and her husband Tom offered to drive us, we decided to act like soldiers and walk to the location. We did this with full packs. <BR><BR>My sister and Tom advised us that they would check on us at least every other day and that they would bring us food and lemonade and such. Tom also, offered to provide us with two weapons to be used for protection against any strangers that may try to harm us. After all this was before cell phones and we would be on our own big-time. There was also a heavy rattlesnake threat in that area, so we happily took him up on the offer. Tom met us at an area near the mine shafts later that day and gave us an M-1 rifle and a 12 gauge shotgun, with ammo for both.<BR><BR>The dirt trail that leads off of the main highway goes very far back into the mountains. In fact, were you to traverse it to its end, you would end up on top of what is known as Grass Mountain. Craig and I decided to get about three miles in and away from the highway, which was about a mile past what once was an old 1920s campground, and live deep in the bush like soldiers would. We found a great spot, next to a clear running creek and set up our tent in the clearing that was there. This clearing was completely surrounded by thick woods. Then night fell.<BR><BR>As we lay in our tent talking by the light of flashlights, we both heard the very loud snap of deadfall in the woods behind the tent. We sat up, frozen and listening. We heard what sounded like a very large and heavy person, slowly walking around our site, making no effort to conceal his presence, judging from the loud sound of breaking sticks and brush. We were both scared believing that someone was out there. We exited the tent, Craig with a shotgun and me with the M-1. I started yelling very loud. \"Hey! We know you are there. We have guns and will shoot!\" <BR><BR>Again, we heard the sound of someone walking slowly but methodically around from our left to right. We shinned our lights in the direction but could not see anything but the trees and brush. We talked amongst ourselves, wondering if it could be a bear or something, but we decided that it was a person and not an animal. After much yelling and warning that we would shoot, I decided to fire a few rounds in the direction of the noise (how crazy that sounds now) and I did just that. I fired about three rounds into the trees and the sound was unbelievable. <BR><BR>The weapon blasted and the sound echoed into the night, roaring into the canyons and fading off into the night air. We stood in silence. To our utter disbelief and eventual horror whatever it was, began to move again, still left to right, in a circle around us. What we both thought and discussed later, was that NO animal would have stuck around after the horrific noise of the M-1. Most normal people would not have stuck around either! Whoever or whatever was out there not only stuck around, but appeared, from the casual sound of the slow walking, to be less than concerned about our weapons. We made a decision to vacate the area post haste! Grabbing our coats, we climbed the embankment up to the dirt road, and carrying our weapons, we ran the entire way, about three miles more or less, back to the main highway, San Francisquito Canyon Rd. We spent a very long night, curled up in a concrete drainage ditch, waiting for the sun to rise. Every hour or so, a lone truck would come by and the sound of that brought us comfort. Again, it was a long night!<BR><BR>The next day, we hiked back to the site, expecting to find our tent and all of our supplies missing. To our surprise, everything was as we had left it. Nothing was out of place. We gathered our things, and hiked back to the open area of the old campground. We decided not to sleep in the tent because it limited our vision, and instead, laid our sleeping bags out in an open area, above the creek. After a day of climbing cliffs and cooking and such, night fell again.<BR><BR>That night, just as the sun set and darkness was beginning to fall, Craig and I were walking in the direction of the main road. We were looking for rattle snakes, because we had shot one earlier on the dirt road in the same area. As we walked side by side with me on the left, both holding weapons, we saw it. Standing just on the dirt road, facing us was a Bigfoot. There can be NO DOUBT at all about what it was. We could see it very clearly. He was about eight or nine feet tall and stood with his left shoulder even with the edge of the trail. He was covered with dark hair and had long arms. We did NOT smell anything unusual, as I have since read about other sightings. <BR><BR>The strange thing about him was the absolute indifference in his expression. He did not look threatening. He did not look scared. He just stood there looking at us.almost bored. I instinctively brought my right hand up against Craig''s chest and we both stopped dead in our tracks. We never took our eyes off of the Bigfoot as we spoke. I said, \"Do you see that? Are we seeing this?\" Craig said, What do we do? What should we do?\" We both started to walk backwards as we spoke, very slowly and involuntarily. The Bigfoot just looked at us for a few moments. <BR><BR>Then, and I will NEVER forget the detail of this he just slowly and very casually turned to his left, and began to walk into the forest. When he did that, Craig and I stopped and started talking over each other. \"Do we shoot it? Should we shoot it? What do we do? Do you want to follow it?\" As we talked, we heard a sound that we both immediately recognized from the prior night, the sound of the Bigfoot slowly walking deeper into the woods, breaking deadfall, twigs and branches as he went. We never did fire a shot or follow him. We stayed up late and slept in shifts at the campground and did not hear from the Bigfoot again.<BR><BR>The next day, Tom came up with food and supplies. We ran to him and told him the details of what had happened. It was very clear by his expression that he did not believe us. We took him to the exact spot where we saw the Bigfoot and we discovered a trail of giant footprints leading from the trail into the woods. Tom smiled and told us that we did a good job making them. We were so frustrated and begged Tom to follow the tracks with us. We all followed them and they went into and across the creek. On the other side, we found a large red ant hill with a footprint right on top of it. I asked Tom, how could we have done that? He just shook his head and smiled. We followed the tracks to a point where two large hills formed a valley that sloped upwards into the mountain area. The ground turned rocky and the prints stopped. <BR><BR>That is what happened. I have lived with this memory for many years. I am now Forty Five years old and am less concerned about what people think of me in terms of this incident. It is a fact and because of it, I know for sure that Bigfoot lives or at least once lived in the area of Green Valley California. <BR>", :environment "Pine forest in the high desert area of Southern California.

My father and Sam AKA Sandy, in front of me took a forest map out and Sam became quiet as the new sightings were only 15 miles from his encounter, and in the direction the creature was traveling. The newer sightings as I recall put the creature near Pear Blossum, CA on the other side of the mountains. I remember a news report of 1000 people lined up across the desert looking for anything and they did find some hair on a barbwire fence. To this day I know of no one having reported this first encounter three days prior. <BR><BR>Another significant item is that in those days bear season and deer season overlaped or was one in the same. At first they thought this might be a deforemed bear (they had bear tags) as they witnessed this being walking on two legs just like any human and appeared to be 7 to 8 feet tall. <BR><BR>They were a few hundred yards away on the other side of the caynon, (don''t remember the name of the caynon) but their rifle scopes allowed them to see this clearly enough that viewing the face and shape they could not decide if this was an animal or a human. I remember Sandy/Sam saying it looked like a monkey man. The animal/person seemingly did not know they were there. They had bear tags and thought about shooting the creature but as I said could not make themselves do it. I recall Sam telling my father that it had to be a bear because it dropped to all fours when it climbed the steeper terrain. My father asked Sam: How did you guys climb it? The reply was the same as the deformed bear. <BR><BR>About then my brother in-law was no longer jovial regarding the sighting and preffered not to discuss the incident. Until now I have more or less left the man alone about it. Today he is a Plant Manager for a large trailer company. <BR><BR>Don still lives in Baldwin Park, CA but maybe moving to San Diego, CA. I seldom cross paths with Don nor have I never pursued the matter with him. If you folks are interested I can put you in touch with both of them but you may have to settle for what I have related. Without the permission of at lest one of the actual witnesses it might not be right to post this information.  <BR><BR>As for myself today I am 40 years old and drive for MTA and I am use to making out reports.

We parked in an area just below the ridge where when the sun lightened up enough we could easily hike up to the top in about 20 minutes. As it got light enough to see the top, we noticed someone already on the ridge wearing what seemed to be black of all things. He had no light, and no gun, and we wondered where he came from because we had been camped there for 11 days, and no one had come by that whole time. We watched him dig around in some brush for at least 30 minutes, pausing occasionaly for long periods to just stare in different directions. We joked that it was probably a hunter from L.A. because anyone would be crazy to wear just black during deer, and bear season. Then he began to walk down the hill right for us, now we never left the truck yet, and he would walk a little ways and the stop and look around just as if he was hunting, but with no rifle. He walked just like a human, so at this time there was no reason to think it was anything but a man. After a little while it was getting light enough to see even better, and he was still walking straight for us. When he was about 50 yards away we both at the same time realized we were not watching a man, but this was a Bigfoot! He walks like a man, but he was not a man. He had jet black, shiny fur, with a reddish color around where his eyes were. At this moment I was ready to run clear home in one leap! I had to see this thing up close, and he had not noticed us yet, so I tried to open the door of the truck real easy so he wouldn''t notice, but that old ford truck was anything but quiet, and he heard the latch release and took one good look before breaking into a run. I tried to bring the scope up to view him closer, but this guy could really move, and I could not get my eye into the scope before he got behind a tree and nev er came out.

We lived in Ukiah, and came over to see my Dad to bring supplies to him and visit at least twice a week. Soon after, we put a trailer on the flats near the boat dock, and moved to the coast permanently.  The encounter happened one evening just before dark, as the sun was just going down over the hill. My parents, younger sister, and younger brother were on the boat and getting ready for bed. It was before 8 p.m.  My older sister and myself had to sleep in the car as there wasn''t enough bunks on the boat for us to sleep. We had blankets and pillows on the seat to sleep on.  The car was a 1957 two-door Pontiac Chieftain. I had the back seat and she the front. I remember it being too early and light out to want to go to sleep. We sat there and talked as teenagers will do. Across the river was a steep rolling hillside that had sheep grazing on it that belonged to a man named Paul Anderson. We had the windows down as it was summer and very nice out. We were interrupted in our talking by the sounds of sheep crying out in unison and baaing in a way that didn''t sound normal for sheep. We both jumped up and looked out the right side windows trying to see what was after the sheep. We could see the sheep running frantically towards the west side of the hillside pasture.  The sheep were scattering in different directions, separating into smaller bunches. To the left  and upper part of the field, we both spotted two very large and hairy animals chasing the sheep.  We thought that they were bears running on their hind legs like trained animals would do. It was very alarming for us to watch as these bears were terrorizing these poor sheep. Our position from the attack was about 150 yards or more. We watched as these big animals chased the sheep for what seemed like hours.  In reality, the whole chase scene was about 20 or 30 minutes. As it got dark, we were sure that the bears would swim the river and come for us next. We locked the doors and hid under the blankets for the rest of night.  It seemed like an eternity til morning came and we could finally get out of the car and go to the boat to see our parents. We told them what had happened, and I know that they thought that we had stayed up all night dreaming up that story. That morning, we were up at the post office near where the attack had occurred, and people were talking about the sheep being killed by a wild pack of dogs that were roaming around. The Sheriff, Sam Costa said that it was unusual for dogs kill and eat only the belly and insides of the sheep.

Forest).  To get to the property, which was located many miles from civilazation, you had to travel on a very rough road (one cut with a dozer) so our motor home could not make it to our lot. Near by was a small pond and a campsite that was for the use of property owners. The pond was about 75 to 100 feet across, the banks were covered in cat tails and the pond was full of trout (we tried all day to catch some fish, without luck). My family(wife, son and 2 daughters) were aware of how quiet it was in the evening, we could not even get a station on the radio. We built a camp fire and were sitting around it watching the field mice run down to the edge of the pond to get a drink. As I remember it was a bright night, the moon was visible overhead. <BR><BR>Along about 10 or 11 pm, the wife and kids went into the camper and went to bed. I remained outside by the camp fire trying to get a station on the walkman radio. About 1am, I was putting out the fire when I saw movement on the other side of the pond, I noticed the movement because of the noise this thing was making. At first I thought it was a deer (I was told they were common in the area) so with that thought I headed toward the sound armed with my trusty flashlite. As I approached, the moonlite was very bright, I could see lots of movement in the cat tails but could not see the animal. At this point it hit me that maybe it was a mountain lion, because I could hear a low rumbling sound like a cat purring but much louder. I decided to return to the motor home, as I turned to retrace my steps (I was probably 50 feet from the noise) this huge hulk stood up in front of me and made a loud screeching noise. It raised up to a full standing position, I would say 7 or 8 ft tall, dark brownish hair.  We looked at each other for a moment and then I turned and ran full speed away from him.  When I looked back to see if he was following me, he was walking in the opposite direction toward the deep forest. I stood and watched him until he disappeared in the deep woods. He did not walk like an animal but more like a man. When I composed myself, I went back to the area I saw him at to look for tracks, but all I found was crushed cat tails, an area of about 10 ft in dia was all smashed down, and it smelled like a strong urine smell in the area. I told the family what I saw and to this day they think I saw a deer or some other animal. I tell this story now to my grand children when we go camping.

It was overcast and very cold with a strong wind blowing. There was still snow on the surrounding peaks. Mono Lake is at the base of the Sierra Nevada mountains. <BR><BR>I do not recall the location at which we parked the car to begin our hike, but I do remember that ours was the only car in the parking area and that the spot was quite desolate. It was a cold Saturday morning and the area was deserted. At 9:17AM I began shooting VHS video footage of our trek, and after a short period of time we finally decided to leave because of the wind and cold. We went back to our hotel in June Lake, enjoyed the rest of the weekend and went home. The trip was quite uneventful (or so we assumed).<BR><BR>The tape went into our family home video collection and for 17 years, from 1991 to 2008, it has been watched countless times by family and friends. So much so that my kids have the dialog on much of the tape collection memorized. On April 19, 2008 my daughter (6 years old in the video and now 22) was watching the tape in the downstairs family room when she suddenly screamed out and began yelling for me to come downstairs. I thought something bad had happened and after racing down the staircase, found my daughter and my ex sitting in front of the television telling me to watch a segment from the tape. What I saw when we played it back made the hair stand up on the back of my neck. And it was something none of us had ever noticed in almost 17 years of watching this tape,<BR><BR>In the final few seconds of the Mono Lake segment just before I turned the camera off I caught something very large and black moving between two rock formations a short distance from where we had been hiking. It was completely black with no differentiation in color or texture and walked upright like a human but with a gate more like a primate. At first I thought it was a bear, but after going over the video many times and finally digitizing and sharpening it I am now unsure what to think. From examination of the footage of my family whose distance from the camera was comparable to that of the creature it is easy to see the distinct details and variation in clothing, hair, face and hands. In contrast, the creature caught on tape exhibits none of those distinctions.The shape of the body does not resemble a human. The head is too large and the arms are too long. And although it does resemble a bear at one particular angle in the clip, the stance and gate don''t add up. It is an intriguing mystery.<BR><BR>That we were able to go for 17 years without noticing this event on the tape seems unbelievable, but in retrospect it actually makes some sense. The segment lasts for only a couple of seconds and the focus is on the lake and mountains which is what I must have been filming at the time. I didn''t see it when I shot the tape and it has since gone unnoticed because one must really be looking for it to see it.<BR><BR>I am not a person who is prone to believing in conspiracy theories, alien abductions and bizarre events such as a purported Bigfoot sighting. I''ve seen various footage and photographs of Bigfoot/Sasquatch sightings over the years and have always been extremely skeptical of their authenticity. As an engineer who now teaches high school physics, I am highly educated and very level headed. If I see something I don''t understand my natural reaction is to analyze it rationally using the scientific method. I do not jump to conclusions based on faulty hypotheses. So in this case, I will suspend judgment pursuant to further investigation. But having shown this video to family and friends whose opinions I trust, the overall reaction seems to be a unanimous \"Bigfoot!!\" Wishful thinking? Maybe. Maybe not. Either way it is very intriguing and definitely warrants further investigation.<BR><BR>Your opinion and assistance in this matter would be appreciated.<BR>", :environment "Away from the lake, the area is arid, a dry desert like area with sparse grass, very rocky with small bushes, and no trees.

We arrived at the lakes at appx. 11 a.m. and fished until 2:30 p.m., at which time we decided to head back down the trail for home.  There were quite a few hikers in the area over the course of the day, appx. 13 hikers and a pack train consisting of 4 riders and 8 horses and a dog. Some coming in, some going out.  Anyway, we headed down the trail following the pack train.  We stopped on the way down to read the sign about the wagons that tried to use that trail way back in the day. I heard a noise like some one else coming down the trail behind us and told my family let''s get going.  The trail was pretty dry and dusty and my husband kept insisting that we give the hikers ahead of us some time so we could avoid walking in their dust. The next section of trail was slightly up hill so after cresting the top and going a short distance down the other side we stopped for a water break.  We heard what we thought was a shout, my son shouted back and something answered, but the echo was pretty bad, so we couldn''t make out what was being said.  We continued on down the trail and had just approached the south end of Leavitt Meadows, when my husband says \"What is that?\"  Both my son and I stopped and looked across the river toward the meadow.  From the beginning it was a strange sight, because this large black thing appeared to be floating across the meadow.  At first I thought it was a backpacker perhaps riding a bike, because it was moving so quickly across the meadow. It was moving quickly and smoothly.  It didn''t make sense.  If it was a back packer, to be moving that fast, he would have to be running and running with a back pack is anything but smooth; if he was riding a bike, then why couldn''t I see the bike and its arms and legs were in line with its body, not bent at an angle like it was sitting on something.  Also the color, I couldn''t figure out why a backpacker would be wearing black, black cap, black backpack, black pants, black coat.  It was at least 80-85 degrees.  We stood and watched silently for a time, perhaps 10-15 seconds.  The speed and smoothness with which it traveled was mesmerising.  Then my husband and son took off running further up the trail to another vantage point; they continued to watch it silently, then just shortly after I caught up to them, my son yelled, and the thing stopped and turned toward us.  It didn''t turn as a human would turn, even one wearing a backpack.  Then it began moving across the meadow again.  Not faster or slower, just the same floating type pace. <BR>We were on the trail above the meadow, looking down and appx. 500-800 yards a way from the object.  My husband believes the thing was following the pack trail. We left the trail and went down to the meadow.  We stayed on the trail side of the river.  The thing was on the opposite side of the river.  By this time it was gone or hidden from us.  The best way to describe it is like this.  The thing had a head that sat directly on its shoulders.  It did not appear to have a neck.  That is why we at first thought it was a backpacker.  It went head, broad shoulders or backpack, no neck, large body.  We could not discern its legs or arms due mostly to the angle at which it was leaving us. The grass in the Meadow obscured some of the legs. We have spent many hours in the woods, my husband was raised in Plumas county, neither he nor I have ever ever seen anything like this.

It was late July of 1977. My family was up in the eastern Sierras, near Mono Lake, approx 13-15 miles above Conway Summit in an area known as Virginia Lakes. My dad told my brother and I to go to the lake and gather firewood. It was late in the day and the sun was down but it wasn''t dark yet, only dusk. I was 14 yrs old and my brother was 1 month shy of 16. He had his learners permit so we were allowed to take the truck.<BR>We got to the lake and started loading up some wood. I had just returned to the truck and dropped the wood when I heard, what I thought, was someone walking through the brush. The foot falls were very heavy, almost like someone was jumping, but the steps seemed pretty rapidly placed. Where we were gathering wood was near a large hedge of bushes, approx 6 to 7 feet high and very dense with only 1 path through the bush to skirt the lake without wading in the water. I turned to the bushes, where the sound was coming from, and saw the bushes shaking and bending, as if something large was moving through the bushes, making a lot of noise. I watched for a few seconds when my brother came running to the truck, white as a ghost and eyes bulging wide.<BR>I said,\"Jeff, what was that?\"<BR>He was scared and out of breath. \"I don''t know, but let''s get out of here.\" he said.<BR>We jumped back into the truck and drove all out. On the way back to the camp, he told me that he was only 10 or 15 feet away from it. He heard the stomping and crashing of the brush, and turned to see a large, dark-brown head above the bushes moving rapidly away from him. He didn''t see the face. <BR>He was so scared, he crashed the truck into a tree on the way back to camp. My dad was pretty pissed, to say the least, and didn''t believe our story, even when we were crying because of how frightened we were. He finally calmed down and said that we probably saw a bear. But, bears do not walk through heavy brush on 2 legs. And my brother swore that it was not a bear. I think my dad started to believe that we saw something since we both would not go out to the camp fire that night, and both of us refused to go to the lake alone for the rest of the trip.<BR>Since that time, I have told several people with very few people actually believing me. Most told me that big foot are only in the north-west in Oregan/Washington. But, after finding this website, I feel a bit vindicated.

I left my home in Manhattan Beach, California about 8:00 AM on the morning of February 16th after one last unsuccessful attempt to persuade my son to join me for a long weekend of wild pig hunting.  Monday was Presidents Day, my son was off school, and the Fort was open for hunting.  But 16-year old boys have other interests.  I arrived at the Fort about 12:30 PM alone, checked into Training Area 10/13 to hunt, and stopped at the Hacienda for lunch and to claim my room for the weekend.  After changing to camouflage clothing and hunting boots I headed up Sulfur Springs Road to where Training Area 10/13 begins.<BR><BR>About 4:30 PM I stopped to look at a creek that crosses under Sulfur Spring Road near Lyons Pond in Area 7 as I drove Northeast.  I learned of the creek that is often used as a wallowing spot, on a guided hunt in 1999.  From the road I could see much recent activity.  It appeared as though quite a few pigs had been wallowing in the small creek the night before.  I drove on about 150 yards and parked my Bronco along Sulfur Spring Road.  <BR><BR>I climbed down the 20-foot high embankment to the creek to check the area more carefully.  There were very fresh wallows all along the creek with many fresh droppings in addition. I walked on to Lyons Pond, which was dry, and returned to Sulfur Springs Road.  All of the fresh sign was in Area 7 at the edge of the road, but I was registered to hunt in Area 10/13on the other side of the road.  This is an important distinction at Hunter Liggett.  If you are caught with a loaded gun in an Area you are not registered to hunt, you are banned from the Fortforever.<BR><BR>I solved this conflict by noticing that the pigs appeared to be using a large culvert to cross under the road from Area 10/13 to Area 7.  I decided that I would wait for their return on the 10/13 side of the road.  I positioned myself about 10 yards off, and 20 feet below the road.  My hope was that the pigs would be traveling up the creek through Area 10/13 to Area 7 just after the sun set.  It was about 5:00 PM when I took my position with determination to not move until 30 minutes after sunset.  <BR><BR>The first hour of waiting was pretty boring.  Nothing was moving and the forest was eerily quite.  About an hour before sunset the woods began to show signs of life.  A few Blue Jays and Woodpeckers flew by and a few frog croaks resonated from the small creek I was watching.  Closer to sunset I noticed two does moving through the woods and squirrels scampering about.  I knew that if the pigs returned to the creek it would be in those magical 30 minutes after sunset and that time was just arriving!  <BR><BR>Much to my disappointment, a blue Ford Ranger also arrived as the sunset.  Two hunters climbed out, grabbed their rifles and walked down a small, grassy road that entered the woods about 75 feet from where I was sitting.  I watched them pass and disappear on the road that was slightly above my hidden sitting position.  My hopes of a pig encounter of the close kind were dashed.  I was certain these hunters would either intercept my prey or scare them away with their movement and noise.  <BR><BR>I was heartened a few minutes latter as I saw both hunters returning along the road to their truck.  I watched them carefully with my new Swarovski binocular.  It was about 10 minutes after sunset and without the binocular they appeared as shadows in the darkening forest.  With my Swarovski binocular I could see details of the weaving in the plaid hunting jacket one was wearing and the rifles they were carrying.  They climbed into their truck and drove offleaving me with 15 more minutes of wild pig hope.<BR><BR>These minutes passed slowly as I glassed the forest in search of movement.  The frogs in the creek began a loud chorus that added to the excitement.  There was lots of movement but no signs of pigs.  Chipmunks and squirrels were scampering about and I saw a coyote moving in the distance.  Drizzle started to fall, along with my hopes, as the last few minutes of hunting time expired.  I resolved to return to the same spot in the morning as I put the lens covers on my binocular and gather up my backpack and rifle.<BR><BR>But before I could stand up I saw a flash of light color a few 100 yards back into the forest.  I had no idea what I had seen out of the corner of my eye.  The color was white or silver-gray, not a color that I would expect to see on a wild pig.  I looked off into that direction for a few seconds before seeing another brief flash of the same light colored object.  Both confused and intrigued I watched as repeated flashes of white or silver-gray coloring appeared in the forest.  Whatever it was appeared to be moving and after about 20 seconds of watching I realized that it was moving in my direction along the same road the two hunters had walked earlier.<BR><BR>I believed I watched this creature move through the forest for about two or three minutes before I finally got a clear, unobstructed view of it against a light sky background.  My attitude was relaxed but attentive as I tried to figure out what I was seeing.  Patches of silver-gray flashed through openings in the forest, sometimes high, sometimes low!  My attitude changed to surprise and fright as I saw it take 4 or 5 full steps in a 30-foot clearing along the raised road, 75 feet from where I was sitting.  I was wide-awake, completely sober, free from any medications, and completely focused on this approaching object.  I was alone, watching with my naked eyes, and heavily armed.  I had a Model 70 in 300 Winchester magnum in my hands and was carrying a Tarus Raging Bull in 454 Casull on my belt.  <BR><BR>What the hell was it?  <BR><BR>I dont know!  <BR><BR>It was walking completely upright on two legs.  <BR><BR>It was very large.  I estimate that it was 8 feet tall and weighed 800 lbs.  Not 30 minutes before I had watched two hunters cross the same 30-foot opening and had thought how small they looked.  In contrast, I was surprised at how big this creature was.<BR><BR>It was covered with silver-gray hair from its very pointed head to its feet.  The only difference in coloration was a dark facial mask and similar colored palmsbrown or black.<BR><BR>I saw this creature in side profile and could make out few facial features.  What I could see appeared very flat, with little nose or chin protruding.  The silver-gray hair on the head rose about 8 from the top of the facial mask to a pronounced point at the top of the skull.  The head blended into the body without any visible neck in between.<BR><BR>The silver-gray hair on the arms was about 4 inches long.  I could see this clearly as these very long, heavily muscled arms swung in cadence with its fast, uninterrupted, strides.  Bulging back and shoulder muscles flexed visibly under the hair as it strode along the road.<BR><BR>It was not carrying nor wearing anything.  Both hands were empty.  There were no shoes, belt, pack or anything else that would suggest cultural development or advanced intelligence.<BR><BR>Four long, powerful strides in a clear opening against the still light Western sky and it was gone!  <BR><BR>I was dumbfounded!  What the hell had I just seen?  It took me about 10 seconds to grab my backpack and start running up the 10 grade to Sulfur Spring Road to get another look.  I slipped to one knee as I scrambled up the hill and pulled my Raging Bull out of its holster as I reached the road.  My heart was racing and my hands were trembling but it wasnt from the runningI was pretty damn scared!<BR><BR>It was 40 minutes past sunset, but I was looking West toward an open field on the other side of the road, the direction in which this creature was headed.  There was nothing movingI couldnt see or hear any sign of what I had just seen.  I walked slowly down the center of the Sulfur Spring Road toward the point where the other road connected.  I called out a number of times to see if anyone or anything would respond.  Nothing did.  After a few minutes I slowly walked backward down the center of Sulfur Spring Road toward my Bronco that was parked about 200 yards East of where I had been hunting.<BR><BR>I jumped in and locked the doors!  I turned it around and slowly drove back toward the Hacienda with the bright lights searching for any signs of movement along the road.  The drizzle turned to serious rain as I reached the Hacienda.  I went directly to the restaurant for dinner and a few glasses of wine.  I chatted with two other hunters seated at the same table.  We exchanged stories of seeing deer and fresh pig sign in the areas we had hunted.  They told me of seeing a flock of wild turkeys run across their path in Area 7, not far from the Hacienda.  I didnt say a word about what I had just seen.  I was sure they would think I was nuts.   I was sure because I was beginning to wonder myself!<BR><BR>It rained hard all night.  <BR><BR>A heavy rain continued until about 11:00 AM Sunday morning.  <BR><BR>I left the Hacienda an hour before sunrise on February 17th headed back to the spot where I had seen this unbelievable creature.  I parked in the same spot as the day before, and loaded my rifle and pistol before I unlocked the door as the sky began to gray in the East.  I watched the creek for pigs until about 30 minutes after sunrise, then began looking for footprints along the small road where I had seen what appeared to be a silver-gray Sasquatch.<BR><BR>The road was covered with grass and extended only about 200 yards from Sulfur Spring Road to where it dead-ended at a small ravine. There were few patches of bare dirt and no tracks.  Either the grassy road didnt show tracks or the rain had washed them away. Or, perhaps, there had been nothing to leave tracks in the first placeonly an over active imagination!<BR><BR>From the end of the road I slowly still-hunted toward an adjacent ridge.  It was a few hundred feet above the surrounding ground and offered a good vantage point to glass for movement.  While I kept my eyes open for pigs, I was really looking for something silver-gray.  I saw neither.  At noon, I returned to Sulfur Spring Road and walked back into Area 7.  Lyons pond had little new water in it despite the heavy rain over the last 18 hours.  There were few pig and deer tracks on the bare dirt as the heavy rain had washed most of the tracks away.  I saw no sign of any tracks that might have been left by the beast I saw the night before.  <BR>", :environment "The immediate area is a low lying wooded area along a small creek.

I was working for the US Forest Service on the Monterey Ranger District (Arroyo Seco Station). One the first things we had to do before the day began was go on a 2-mile fitness run. I dont remember the specific day. I began my run about 8:30 am about 3/4 of the way through the run I began to fall behind the crew. I came to area known as the Abbott lakes area. I stopped to catch my breath. I then heard a noise off to my left on the hillside. The hillside was covered with oak trees, poison oak and thick brush.  The side of the hill was shaded from the sun so I had really looked hard to see what was hearing. I noticed what appeared to a man walking up the hill about 20 feet in front of me. I then realized that this was to tall and to wide to be a person. It was about 8 feet tall. It stopped, turned its head and stared back at me for about 30 seconds. When it turned the whole upper body turned with head. I could not see its face because of the shade. It turned and walked up the hill. I ran back to the station knowing what I seen was not human.  Later that day I was with my supervisor alone and I asked him if he ever seen anything weird near the lakes or the bone yard (trash area). He looked at me and said \"oh you seen it to\" he later went on to tell that other members of forest service seen it to. He states that the season prior that one employee said he seen close up and it was covered with hair. I just blew it off. A month later I was placed on the night shift with one other person.  One of the things was to check the bone yard area for campers. One evening we drove into the bone yard and about 30 feet in front of us was a dark, 8-foot thing walking away from our vehicle.  I did not say anything to my partner until we drove out of the area. She turned to me and said, \"Did you see that?\" I then asked her what the hell is it. She told me she had seen several times in past.  That was the last time I seen it that season.<BR><BR>The 1995 fire season came around and due to budget problems only 3 people were on for the season. This made me nervous because this meant I would work alone 3 days a week. I avoided the bone yard area at all cost when I worked alone.  Halfway though the season a coworker and myself drove into the bone yard area to pick a picnic table.  My partner had a bad habit of wanting to catch a wild turkey for pet so as we drove up he took off running after a turkey that was about 40 feet from our truck. I did not see the turkey once I got off the truck but ran in the direction that my partner was running in.  As I got closer I realized that this was not a turkey we were chasing. As I got a better look at it I realized what I was looking at I only seen the upper body of it because it was walking down a slope. It had turtle shaped head and what appeared to be long tail coming from it. It moved at very fast pace away from us. I backed off, as did my partner.  I took notice of noise that it made as it walked away. I lost sight of it but I could still hear it running through the brush. That was my last season at this station.

We went to an area that had a little lake with an un-improved campground. My parents went up there that Friday morning and we went after work as Brian and I worked at the same place. We picked up Steve on the way out there. We got to the lake at around 9pm Friday night, and after setting up our camp, we sat and talked half the night. The camp was on the north end of the lake. There was a marsh area that had very thick underbrush to the immediate west of our camp. This marsh area extended to almost the southwest of the lake. If you picture a clock, the marsh area would be from the 8''0 clock to the 12''0 clock position. <BR><BR>After spending all day Saturday fishing with my folks and having a great time, we all settled down and relaxed at the camp. We had dinner and built a campfire and we all stared into the fire telling stories until my folks went to bed. At around midnight, Steve, Brian and I were sitting around the fire when I thought I heard something in the marsh area. It sounded like something walking through there. Steve didn''t hear it and I just dismissed it at first. But Brian and I kept hearing it. It soundedd like something going back and forth like it was pacing the camp. I knew no one was camped in that area, so I just thought it was an animal. This went on for about an hour and a half. I even jokeed to Steve that the tent he and Brian were sleeping in was just giftwrap to a bear if one came after them and I''d sleep really good in the back of my truck.<BR><BR>The next morning my folks decided to go home early. My friends and I decided to stay there a couple more days because Brian and I didn''t have to go to work until the following Thursday. By two that afternoon, we pretty much had the whole lake all to ourselves except for a couple of other groups of campers. At 2:30 Sunday afternoon, the three of us piled into my truck to hunt for firewood. We took a dirt road that went east to west along a ridge directly off of the lake''s entrance road about 1/8th mile from our camp. We were following this road in a pretty thick patch of woods for about a mile when it suddenly opened up into a meadow about 300 meters below the ridgeline of the hill we were on. There was another patch of woods to our south that paralleled the road for about 2 or 3 miles. I stopped the truck because we saw a ton of good firewood. <BR><BR>Brian and Steve went in a southeast direction away from the front of the truck while I grabbed my axe and headed in a northern direction towards some logs so we could get some \"all night burners\". I got about 30 ft from the truck when I saw it.<BR><BR>At first I didn''t know what I was seeing. It was a hairy thing sitting down against a tree with it''s back towards me. It was in the treeline we had just come out of. It was only 60 yards from me at most. I stood there frozen because I thought it might be a bear and I only had an axe and I didn''t feel like being any kind of hero. After maybe 5 seconds, it stood up on 2 legs. It looked massive, like 8 to 8 1/2 foot tall and at least 3 1/2 to 4 feet wide. It had reddish-brown hair all over it and it matched the color of the bark on the trees perfectly. It had huge hands that came down to just above it''s knees. It grabbed onto the trees just to guide itself through them, not push them aside. There were some pretty good sized trees in that patch of woods and they looked small when this thing grabbed them. It walked away from me towards the crest of the hill and I was amazed at how smoothly it moved. <BR><BR>It was weaving in and out of the trees stealthily and it never made a sound, not a grunt, not a wheeze, nothing. I didn''t even hear footsteps. As it got near the top of the hill, it stopped and looked down into the next valley to the North and it just walked on over the hill never even looking back at me. I couldn''t see it''s face. I didn''t see a neck either, just it''s head set kinda on top of it''s shoulders. <BR><BR>I stood there for about 10 seconds when I got the nerve up to get the hell out of there. I backed down the hill to the truck and I noticed that Brian and Steve were still gathering wood. I joined up with them after I got a soda from the truck and I calmed down. I gathered some wood with them and we got out of there. They never saw it. We stayed there another couple of nights, but we didn''t have another incident for the whole trip.

It looked exactly like the many drawings they''d seen of Bigfoot. They doubt this was someone dressed in a Gorilla costume. When it was light, Mary and Jerry returned to the scene and found large, deep footprints in the snow. They took pictures of the prints, wrote a narrative of their adventure and posted the information on the wall of their bakery.

Five years ago I interviewed a group of young people regarding a sighting. The sighting took place in the Mojave rive bed in Hesperia California. The first report came from five teenage boys who were exploring down in the riverbed late in the after noon when a noise in the dense under brush that grows in places along the river startled them.<BR><BR>They said the noise sounded like something big moving through it. When they moved closer to get a look they said they saw a large hairy ape like creature. As this frightened them, the boys ran home and told their parents, which is when I first heard the story. The boys father went down into the area of the sighting with a gun to see if he could see what the boys had reported, but found nothing. <BR><BR>The boys older sister rode her horse down to the spot on two consecutive days, to try and get a look at the creature. On the second day, her efforts were rewarded. In her statement to me she said, \"I was riding north in the river bed on my way home after searching for several hours, when I came to an area where there are two stands of cottonwood and pepper trees one on each side of the trail. My horse spooked and didn''t want to go on. I looked around and to my right I saw a tall hairy thing standing there looking at me. It looked at me for about a minute, then I turned my horse and ran her in the opposite direction and took another trail home.\" <BR><BR>I investigated the area and though I wasn''t able to see the Bigfoot itself, I did find what seemed to be a nest of sorts where the animal had been bedding down. I also found footprints that measured twenty inches by eleven inches. These prints were in very soft deep river sand so I''m sure the size is out of proportion, but maybe this will assist you in determining the animals size. When I asked the young woman about color she said it was a dark brown or black. I didn''t think about it after making my own documentation until I read the recent article in the Mohave Daily News Archives.<BR><BR> After reading the article I thought my information might be useful to you. My neighbor took some pictures of the footprints, and though they are of very poor quality I might be able to acquire them for you if you want.

Anyway in May 1982, while serving on active duty at Camp Pendleton, CA, I was temporarily assigned to a staff of Marines supervising a youth program consisting of a rigorous series of two week long mini-boot camps for teen-aged boys.<BR><BR>Camp Pendleton is flanked by the Pacific on its western flank and by the Cleveland National Forest [on its] northeastern flank. Three different Mt. ranges intersect the base itself and I am very familiar with every nook and cranny on its over 200,000 acres of mountains, ridges, ravines, canyons, trails, back roads and the like.<BR><BR>Anyway on one particular calm night after a long grueling day of forced marches, displays and demonstrations we took all 300 boys up to a bivouac site for the night. The site is situated on large, open meadow shelf above the Infantry Training School at San Onofre/52 area. The boys were exhausted yet eagerly setting up their shelter-halves. They began to get a little too loud, so I began to quiet them and bed them down for the night. The rest of the staff was situated about 35 meters away, up on a little knoll that overlooked the boys. However, I wasn''t aware that the staff had already bedded down and that I was the last one still up except for the radio watch, which was half asleep too.<BR><BR>It had become dark with exception of a bit of starlight, which gave me a very good range of vision. Finally I succeeded in getting the kids in the sack and quiet. I then stood for a few moments to ensure all was secure and that not one peep could be heard and none could be.<BR><BR>As I turned facing west and looked towards the closest edge of the perimeter I noticed a tall, dark, bulky figure standing about 15 meters beyond the last tent or 20 meters from where I stood. We seemed to be staring at each other, but it&#8217;s hard to say because I could not make out any of its facial definition, but I had a strong gut feeling that it was checking me out real good since I was the only thing moving around. I could feel my heart begin to pound and my entire body felt like it wanted to anchor to the ground. There was no doubt someone or something very odd and dangerous was standing there looking at me. I mean this thing was TALL and wide at the shoulders.<BR><BR>I used my peripheral vision to make sure I wasn''t seeing things, but it only confirmed what I already knew. It gently and slightly moved its upper body left and right ever so slowly as though looking around to its front, surveying the area. It was an easy 8 feet tall. Like I mentioned previously, all I could make out was its massive silhouette and no real detail features. It had very broad shoulders, little or no neck, dark, and looked very powerful.<BR><BR>I decided to go get a flashlight out of our vehicle at the top of the knoll and let staff know what was going on. So I began to cautiously and quietly step backwards to prevent whatever it was from charging or coming into bivouac. I continued to keep an eye on the dang thing, which just remained in the same spot. Almost halfway up the knoll I lost sight of it, but I continued to move slowly still trying to locate it. From atop of the knoll it was very difficult to see anything clearly outside the fringe of perimeter because of the dark.<BR><BR>I walked back down to the tents, scanned the area with the flashlight, but didn&#8217;t see anything like I had before. The figure had obviously moved. So instead of waking anybody up I sat up for a while and waited to see what and if anything would happen. I also hoped the darn thing wouldn''t pop up behind me (we were all unarmed). It would have been worse and maybe a calamity if I had  pushed the panic button and had waken everybody up. After all, we were in charge of nearly 300 young street kids without any formal training, out in the open and I didn&#8217;t need the grief if nothing I said or described could have been verified. Thankfully nothing else occurred that night.<BR><BR>In the morning just before daybreak I bee-lined for the spot where I saw the thing standing. There wasn''t anything there ... nothing. Not a pole, a bush, a tree, a reed.  I mean nothing that could have simulated what I had seen. We were situated on flat, clear open ground with exception of the knoll and a tree line about 50 to 60 meters away and a mountain behind that which I knew all existed and had seen back-dropped way beyond the figure the previous evening.<BR><BR>The ground was grassy, but was already pretty well matted down and rutted by the constant foot and vehicle movement in that particular training area. I know I saw something that wasn''t normal. I know  it wasn''t hoax, I know it wasn&#8217;t the kids (they were all accounted for). I trust my judgment and I&#8217;m now 46 years old and still have perfect vision. I know it wasn''t any of the staff because I had seen all of them sleeping when I got up the hill. At that time I had nearly 11 years of active military service in the infantry and had done plenty of night OP''s [ed: Observation Posts] to know how to use my eyes in the dark and to know the difference between a bush and a moving object. This was BIG, and real! Oh, and the thing was very quiet, I didn&#8217;t hear it make a sound.

First I must say that I don''t think a bigfoot lives real close to where I live but I do think we live within it''s (plural) normal range or migration route. <BR><BR>The first sighting was in 1998 in the winter, we are not really sure...  My brother was driving home and was on our private driveway when he drove by something that he could not describe.  He walked in andsaid he had just saw a bear or a big black person wearing animal fur, or a cow...  Basically his mind could not fit what he saw into any specific category  and he was very confused.  Upon questioning him he said it looked like a homeless person wearing animal skins.  He said they passed right by eachother going in opposite directions.  Since our road is a graveled one lane road they must have been within a couple of feet from eachother! He told me it had just happened so we went to investigate.  I was thinking there was a homeless person passing through... But then we turned a corner and I saw the footprint from about 50ft away!  I was so amazed that I stopped my truck and got out and immediately took off my shoe and sock to compare sizes...  I was not thinking about a bigfoot, it didn''t really cross my mind until a couple of years later actually...  I was still thinking it was a homeless person with huge barefeet!  I''m a size 12, I put my foot inside this track...  It was 4-6 inches longer and 3-4 inches wider than my foot.  And it was sunk into a hard pack dirt road about an inch or more.  Being 200lbs myself, I jumped around trying to make an impression an inch deep in this strata but to no avail.  I couldn''t sink my own track at all! I mean no inches, nada!  So now I was thinking about a homeless person wearing animal skins with huge feet and that was significantly heavier than me...  But there were two problems to this obvious bigfoot sighting (in hindsight)... Number one, bigfoot do not live so far south in California (or so I thought), and my brother did not come in and say, \"I just saw a bigfoot!\"  So it never occurred to either of us that this was a bigfoot sighting!!!  It wasn''t until a couple of years later that I asked him if what he saw could have been a bigfoot and he said,\" oh yeah, that makes sense now...\"  It took us awhile to put 2 and 2 together but we finally did with the help of this website.  I found it while web surfing and his sighting started to make sense...  Then I became more aware of my surroundings in relation to bigfoot.  We live in a typical second growth redwood forest with all the typical animals that I see quite often.  But I was never looking for bigfoot until now.  <BR>2004 was an exciting year.  We had 2 more sightings and a very loud vocal performance!  So, I was watching tv outside in the covered porch/ gazebo.  If you turn down the tv you can hear all of the night sounds as if you were outside.  Around 11:30ish pm  I heard something so I turned the tv off.  I then heard a very loud screaming roar right in front of my house.  And judging from the location of the first sound I heard that was distorted by the tv, I deduced that whatever this was was walking down my driveway and was very close!  It roared twice more while following the road.  I was dumbfounded!!!  And then I got scared... I''ve lived in the woods my whole life and think nothing of walking around in the dark with out a flashlight.  You couldn''t have dragged me outside at this point!  I''m 6''3, 220lbs, and this thing sounded huge. I compare the roar to the decibel level of a siren!  It just echoed off the hills.  I have compared it to the recordings on this sight and it is very close to the Washington recordings, especially the one from 2005.  I am so glad that my dad and mom both heard this!  It just gave you the impression that it had huge lungs to make such a loud noise!  But interestingly enough the last roar was ended with two very clear dog barks that I presume were mimicked...  All of the dogs in the vicinty were going crazy except the dogs that were the closest to where this thing had traveled...  <BR>Two nights later was the second sighting.  This time it was in the front yard of my Dads house.  I was leaving in my Suburban.  I was just edging down the driveway when I got something out of the corner of my eye.  I turned and looked at what appeared to be a large pile of redwood bark lying in the yard as if my dad had cut down one of his trees and had raked all the bark into a pile.  Redwood bark is reddish...  As I passed slowly by I realized that my dad had not cut down any of his trees and that there would be no reason for a large pile of redwood bark to be piled there.  What I have deduced is that a bigfoot was balled up hiding from me!  And it semi worked.  There was a fence between us and if I were in a smaller car I wouldn''t have seen it, but I was very high up in a raised Suburban so I could see over the fence.  It looked as if it was on it''s knees hunched over with its head on the ground and it''s arms over it head.  I say semi worked because I kept driving and didn''t realize what I had seen until a couple of minutes later.  When I went back my pile of redwood bark had disapeared.  I was so disapointed because I was only about 15 ft away! The next sighting I again missed out by seconds!  My wife and I were driving on our driveway and she said she had just I contact with someone...  I had driven about 30 more ft and stopped. I asked her and she said she saw a dark face with deep inset eyes and a shaggy head looking at her from behind a tree.  The windows of the car were still dewed up from the cold morning so I backed up and got out.  I heard bi pedal footsteps walking away through the oak leaves.  It was a very definitive sound...  I would have followed if I was not in business clothes...<BR>So I think a bigfoot or more lives in the area.  There are 60-70,000 acres near by and I believe we are in a corner of their range that they visit every once in awhile since the occurances are not everyday.

Since I did not want to travel south again to Redding we decided on highway 96 to Yreka, and I-5 as a shortcut. <BR><BR>My youngest daughter was with me, and we had driven a long ways and so we gassed up in Willow Creek and decided to continue to drive. It was late and it was a boring uneventful dark drive up this \"Bigfoot Highway 96, but finally we crossed a bridge on the Klamath River and got to a campground where we finally saw trailers and trucks and people type stuff. The road then goes up a switchback to a ridge for a mile or so, and I slowed my speed down to 25 mph. <BR><BR>So, as I got to the ridge, maybe a couple miles from the bridge, I came around this last switchback, and to the right my headlights swept the left embankment and I thought there was a bear coming down the embankment towards the highway. I slowly crept ahead and began to stop as this bear was shuffling down this embankment on two feet, but it was not a bear. I stopped completely and not over one hundred feet in front of me was this thing intent on getting across the road the road in front of me.<BR><BR>If I didn''t see it on the bank I probably would''ve hit it, because it was that close. It got to the center line in three long steps and looked at me and then jumped off the road.  I mean from the centerline on its right leg it jumped clear off the pavement and over a two foot embankment and was out of sight. <BR><BR>It was not overly tall probably just six feet or a little taller, but extremely was thick maybe in the 300 pound range this thing was built. It was hair not fur and matted and dark brown but with a rusty auburn tint to it. I was extremely close with high beams on, and stopped in the road. It had long arms like a gorilla or something, and it sort of lumbered forward like a gorilla only fast with definite long strides; it had something it was aiming for and when it looked at me it turned its head back straight and this thing jumped off the road like an elk on one leg. It had extremely thick legs and shoulders, and no man could make a jump like that. If I had a video camera in the dash of my car you would have seen the video of your life. I couldn''t make out any genitalia it was so hairy I would estimate its body hair like six inches long and matted and dangly, but not so much on its butt or the back of its legs. I could make out the thighs and they were some guns. <BR><BR>I was too scared to get out of my car to look over the embankment, that and my daughter was freaked out. Get the heck out of here. I took a picture of the hillside he came down. I can find the exact spot and in fact am on vacation this next week and I got an infrared camera and a motor drive dslr this time, and oh, I ain''t getting out of my car without my gun. Don''t get me wrong I aint a gun freak but I could have rammed this thing with my car the first time. I don''t want to hurt anything, but I don''t want to get my head ripped off by something just on the other side of the dark roadside either.<BR> <BR>This sighting was at 12:55 am and I was wide awake. I checked my odometer from where I saw him it was forty two miles to the next bridge on the river at a small town before I got to the freeway on 96. I am a recreational hunter in my younger years but this isn''t something you hunt; this is something you gawk at. Oh and as close as I was the eyes didn''t glow. I must have counted 60 deer along that road and I saw eyeballs everywhere in the road along side the road from that ridge to Yreka. This thing didn''t have glowing eyes, and I had the high beams on and watched it cross the road and look at me. It didn''t have animal eyes that glowed.

My son and I took a short vacation to my childhood memories trip area to French Gulch where I remembered an eerie thing that happened back in the mid 60''s with my father. I had lived with my grandparents in an small town called Summit City just a few miles below Shasta Lake Dam when my father one day took me to French Gulch way way back deep into the woods North and North East of the French Gulch town. <BR><BR>I remember always feeling as though being watched and sometimes herd really eerie sounds. I remember the eerie sound that made this worse for me to be comfortable. I was a naturalist though and always felt drawn to the deep woods and so it was hard to keep me from it. In latter years after retiring from the U.S. Army I took a trip visiting relatives in Redding, and one evening I packed up the truck for an deep adventure back to those woods and was their mostly to get those big pine cone''s with delicious pine nuts. <BR><BR>We left late that evening, getting their as it turned near dark and I felt my memories would help me find the places I had been as an teen with my dad and park and get some sleep and then wake up at some old cabin. It was as if I could practically reach out to the stars that clear bright night and (as well the moon was out partially) some of the ledges on those high peaks were a bit scary driving by them as it was so dark and far down I couldnt see how far. Then after about three hours of this turn and that and many miles I had forgot to count, and my son fell asleep; I became tired and stopped. <BR><BR>I turned off the truck engine and left the headlights on as I saw so many pine cones about an foot or longer and I began to load a few up. I had a camper shell on the little Plymouth arrow Pickup and could lock ourselves in for the night when time came. <BR><BR>Before I stopped, I just happened to turn the truck around on the road as it made it easier to load some of the pine cones and as I got out beginning to loading more pine cones, that is when I heard that noise and it was very close. I was petrified at the sound as it is nothing like the elk calls that sound a bit eerie too. I began to slowly pick up a few more pine cones as these were only for decorating for our Christmas seasons and as in my childhood days, I would get the green ones that made it from last autumn and were still on the pine trees as I was still the tree climber. I had reached down to pick up the fifth pine cone and it was then I just froze up and full of panicky fear. I could hear up the side of the ledge, ridge, to my right clearly a heavy pounding of what sounded like something very large. Only two distant sounds pounding the ground and the damn thing was coming fast. I dropped the pine cones at once and ran up to the drivers side fumbling in fear with the door trying to get in the truck. Then I started the truck up and was trying to put it into 1st gear and jammed it in just as I let out the clutch awaking my 7 year old son. I had heard the sound coming down behind the right rear of the truck just before I got the truck started. I happened to look back in the darkness behind the truck as it darted forward and in the dimness of the tail lights I seen this awful dark hairy figure standing upright behind the truck. The moon and the stars were out which helped me see this figure form as well. I had been stricken with such fear that I had never known before at this moment and nearly drove off the side of the road when my son said, Dad, watch out !!. I then nearly flipped the truck over, just missing a small log. I had no gun with me.  I would have not feared what this was, and would have shot in the air as a warning or at it if I had to. <BR><BR>It was that darn eerie sound and the sound of the thing coming down the steep hillside, and at that second the issue of absolute fear of not having any defense, that got my spirit stirred. I knew for sure it wasnt a bear, as that memory is still just as plain to see today. It took a while before my son got me to say what happened on the way back as I was barrowing down the mountain as fast as I could, and am surprised I didnt forget each turn I had to make on the roads I chose going out on the way back. <BR><BR>We just pulled into French Gulch when daylight was breaking and I had to stop and sleep for an hour or so when my son woke me up whining about being hungry.  I woke up a bit dazed and it came back to me what had happened and I started up the truck and headed back for Redding.  My son was teasing me, Oh dad it was probably just a bear.<BR><BR>We reached Uncle Bills place on the right side of the road well before Redding where he lived on some property of his brothers wifes Father; an Italian whom passed away. Still to this day my son teases me at his age 23. <BR><BR>I was a ranch care taker a few years back in Flagstaff, Arizona, and I had seen a lot of things and heard a lot of things, but nothing that could ever compare to what I experienced on that early morning above French Gulch, and I surely didnt want to.  I always carried a gun with me on that ranch just the south side of Rodgers Dry Lake even in the surrounding woods.<BR><BR>Their were signs posted before entering that forest North of French Gulch stating to keep out during the evening (Night) and cut firewood only during daylight hours.  I hadnt been their for so many years and wanted to experience what I remembered as an teen, but I sure wouldnt have if I had known what I would have encountered that night.<BR><BR>Im very serious, because I''ve studied the Sasquatch or Bigfoot ever since, and would go with someone else today and be a lot more prepared for such an venture, but never again alone like that night and without some serious protection. I have never herd of where this big beast has come up on some one like me and acting like it did, but it sure did with me.<BR><BR>I hope someone does get some physical evidence because I havent enjoyed being teased all these years; also we could put an end to the mystery of this beast. I''ve known what it was like to have big bears visit at night up in the high country of the Colorado Mountains, Rabbit Ear Mountain-Pass area, where I camped with wife and our first born.  Ive been around the world and seen a lot of things from the mountains in West Germany and in South Korea in the Ming Dung Mountains where the Siberian tiger still remained back in 1975. In all those years I have never had such a scare. My body and hands were trembling and I was scared down to the core of my being.<BR><BR>Sincerely, <BR><BR>Sgt. M.L.D.

I didn''t think much of it at first but there were rocks comming down the hill side and hitting the building. This became more frequent and disturbing as the area above was trees and brush, not likely just a rock slide. The numer of times this occured also became much more frequent through out the weeks. Then came a sort of rainy cloudy day in March of 2001, I think, when I was on the mountain by myself. At Lake Shasta Caverns we had tours leaving 3 times a day and it was the last one that day. From way up on top of the mountain you couldn''t see much beyond you and I''d say the visiblity was 300 yards or less. My tour arrived and turned out to only be two people, a male and female. The bus driver turned the bus around and returned to the bottom of the hill. As the three of us were standing there we were looking out across the ravine talking quietly when we heard some rustling and distinct thumps on the ground. They asked me what it was and I just kept watching thearea it was comming from. As we were looking up and down the ravine 200yrds away, a never before noticed, but clearly viewable, skid path was spotted by the man on my tour. He had a high pwered scope type camera and zoomed in. All the while we were still waiting to see what was moving down the ravine at such a high speed and moving the tops of what I thought to be pretty large trees on this path. And out of the overgrowth we saw it. Huge, on two feet arms clearly swinging wide in front of it and behind it. In a matter of 2 seconds or so it was no longer visible but we could still hear it. The thumping was it''s feet running down hill to the water of the lake, straight down. The echo continued until suddenly a silence. I turned to the man and asked if he got it. He said,\" I don''t know, I think so.\" I then immediatly ran for the emergency radio we keep in the storage/employee room and called down to the bus at the bottom. I told them what we all saw and to be careful and get up here, we want to go, NOW. My boss then came across and told me to calm down, get inside the building and wait there for the bus. When we got back across the lake to the main gift shop I exchanged numbers with the people on the tour but my boss kept theirs and I have not gotten anything from the from that day.

The surrounding that area was old growth pine trees. I looked over at the old growth area and there stood Big Foot. He was about 5'' tall, and hairy all over. His eyes were large as if he were use to living in darker environment. I told my friend to turn around slowly, and look, as he did the Bigfoot melted out of sight back into the forest.<BR> <BR>After we had gone to bed for the night around 2:00 AM in the morning, something hit the station wagon so hard that it rocked back and forth.

He was huge.  From the boat he appeared to be at least 7 to 8 feet tall. He had long shaggy hair, very dark brown. While all of this is going on Ginger the dog was going berserk.

From where the camp is located we were on the east side of the mountain. From that point the mountain goes straight up. Lots of brush and timber. Suddenly, whatever it was started screaming and we could hear it crashing through the brush. It scared the hell out of us.<BR><BR>Then it must have turned and headed uphill. It was still screaming but it sounded like it was getting further away. We were both too shook-up to move, so we just sat there not saying a word. I guess about 20 minutes passed without hearing anything, then all of a sudden we heard a log come flying down the mountain crashing through the brush.<BR><BR>Then it started again: this time the screaming was louder and seemed to be closer. The wind was coming from the north, which was where the spring was. All of a sudden it smelled like something had died. It smelled like a strong urine odor. The smell was overwhelming; it was like somebody had opened an outhouse door or something. And the screaming was louder than ever.<BR><BR>Then all of a sudden it went quiet. We stayed up another hour or so before we decided to turn in for the night. We put some more wood on the fire and got in the tent and got ready to sleep. Then it started again.

The sasquatch began stomping with enough force to almost bounce me up and down on a log seat and the chants grew loud, spirited and quite hysterical. The seat I was on was a thick log supported on either side, about seven feet apart by other logs, that literally bounced when the\"protest dance\" began. The message of their chant was unmistakable in any language : \"GET THE --== OUT!\" So much that I declared, \"whatever that is doesn''t want us here, let''s just pack up and go!!!\" <BR>My friends, although visibly quite shaken, were still reluctant to concede our site. Then, abruptly the chants, actually shouts and screams stopped. With a few deep hooted orders from what I believed to be the male, the pack of voices trailed off. I didn''t relax again until I heard screams much later, far up the valley and then from the mountaintop on the other side. Just passing through, I thought. <BR><BR>Later, just after I had settled into my tent, my tentmate asked, \"Did you hear that\"? Even though I had my sleeping bag pulled back from my ears because I had heard a shuffling in exactly the place he described I replied, \"No\", hoping it would go away. I lay there on my back watching the fires orange glow and then, BLACK! A silhouette had eclipsed our fire and was squatted in front of the tent! I caught a scream in my Adam''s apple for fear I might frighten the creature into... who knows what. It was so close! I could feel it''s breath pushing against the nylon and a warm stentch filling the air. Five clear digits groped at the zipper in curiosity. I could sense the way a German Shepard senses the fear of an adolescent, that the sasquatch knew that I knew he was there, and that I was literally scared pissless! I had to go before he arrived but held it all night! The shadow gave way to the familiar warm glow of the fire just as it had arrived. <BR><BR>In the morning I actually found some hairs (thin black hairs with silver tips) and a few deep pot holes on the trail that were pushed in by something heavy. <BR><BR>Before the encounter I was a skeptic. Now I feel Dr. Krantz''s idea of families is exactly what we encountered. (I saw a documentary after the incident) I also feel I \"sensed\" the intelligence, compassion and even mischevious sense of humour that these animals possess. <BR><BR>Please don''t take this as a joke, at least I believe every word of what I said. Yes I do kick myself for not collecting the hair/photographing the indentations or even swallowing my fear and moving an inch to peak outside!!!!!<BR><BR>I would like to say that I think it was a family of bigfoot, possibly migrating.

Shasta Bally. I figure it was between 1:00 and 2:00 in the morning. My friend and I were awakened by something walking around the pickup, where we were sleeping in the bed of the truck. My first thought was bear, ''cause there are a lot of them in that area. I have had many bears walk around my tent in the Thousand Lakes Wilderness Area near Burney, CA. But this did not sound anything like a bear. It was then that I noticed my friend was awake and looking at me.<BR><BR>He asked me, \"What is that?\" <BR><BR>I really didn''t know what to make of it. It seemed to be about 40-60 feet away from the truck when we first looked at each other. It circled the truck and when it was near the thicker brush it seemed to come closer. Then it really freaked me out because we smelled a really wild smell. It kinda reminded me of the smell of my dog after he got tore up by coyotes. At the time, Bigfoot never crossed my mind. But my hair totally stood up on the back of my neck. My friend was in the same state.<BR><BR>We were both armed with large-caliber handguns at the time but were too scared to sit up and look. We both just laid there looking at each other. I could hear myself breathing and tried to be as quiet as I could. Something inside me told me that if you sit up you aren''t going to make it off this hill. This thing circled the truck for what I would guess to be about between 1-1/2 or two hours, moving closer, breaking branches -- what sounded like on purpose -- and making grunting sounds. Some time before it got light, it seemed to move off to the southwest.<BR><BR>When the sun came and it was light enough to see we got up and looked around the truck. We never got more than about 30 feet from the truck before we noticed disturbed pine needles and broken limbs on the trees about 6 feet off the ground. <BR><BR>My friend and I left that morning and went back into Redding. We told a few friends and my Dad about what happened. He had no answers either for what happened. I can remember thinking that it sounded like something walking on two legs.

After awhile, my sister wanted to go out to the dock to be with my older sister, so I put her on my shoulders and started walking.  About 1/4 mile half way out I started hearing something walking in the woods. I stopped, it stopped. I started, it started. So I kept walking. I dropped my sister off and started heading back.  A little way in and I started hearing the footsteps again. Now they were closer and I could see something in the shadows. As I kept walking, it kept getting closer.

In addition, the book also goes on to note that it was well known amongst the locals at that time that these creatures wintered in the caves, \"makes winter quarters in some of the caves of the Marble Mountains\".  We also felt that since we would, in all likelihood, be the first people into the backcountry this early in the season it would increase our chances of encountering some sort of activity.<BR><BR>An early scouting trip on 5/10 supported our suspicions.<BR><BR>Late afternoon on Monday, May 10th, we left our hotel in Yreka and headed out into the mountains to familiarize ourselves with the trailhead we would be using early the next morning for our hike into the valley. The weather was quite raw, chilly with cold rain. At approximately 4 pm, as we were winding up the forest service road, we came to what may be described as an overlook or turnout. We decided to pull over and get our first real look at the mountains we would be hiking into the next day. We stopped the Jeep and my two brothers bounded out of the front and began taking pictures. I was just opening the rear door on the passengers side when I suddenly heard what I can only describe as a loud and prolonged, AHHHHH!, coming from my 11 oclock from a low hill roughly 400 yards away. It was a very strange sound and completely unlike anything I had ever heard in the woods before. (I live deep in the High Peaks of the Adirondacks, so I am no stranger to backcountry sounds.) It sounded like a man sort of yelling but it had a deep, animal-like quality to it. I asked my brothers if they had heard the sound, but they said that they hadnt. In fact, I believe that they thought I was joking. <BR><BR>After a few more minutes of snapping pictures, glassing the slope and waiting around to see if whatever had made that sound was going to make it again (it didnt) we piled back into the Jeep and continued up the mountain.<BR><BR>We followed this road all the way to the trailhead (one of our two options for tomorrows hike) without incident.<BR><BR>Coming back down the mountain, we now turned left onto another forest service road to reconnoiter the second trailhead. Conditions immediately went from raw to terrible. This forest service road is unpaved and the cold rain now changed to snow the higher we climbed. (Our elevation at this point was somewhere between 3,500-4,000 feet.) There had obviously been snow at some earlier point because the road had roughly an inch to an inch and a half of old snow scattered on it and piled up on the sides in patches. My brother suggested that we might want to get out of the Jeep and scan the side of the road in order to see if we could come upon any kind of tracks. We were not thinking Bigfoot at this point, we were just trying to get an idea of what kind of animals we might be encountering in the next few days. Almost immediately, we found some large and clear bear tracks. These were good-sized tracks and I would guesstimate that they were from some 300-500 lb. animal. (Again, I live in the Adirondacks and we are well stocked with bears.)<BR><BR>I mention these tracks because as we were following them up the hill we came across a very different set of tracks.<BR><BR>At approximately 4:45 pm we encountered a second set of tracks crossing the road. These tracks were moving perpendicular to the bear tracks we had been following and were clearly NOT bear tracks. The first track was approximately 17-18 inches long and 6 inches in width. It looked exactly like a naked human footprint, but there was little visible arch. In other words, it was rather filled in where you would expect the arch indentation to be. The print appeared to be from a right foot and a clearly defined big toe was visible. It also seemed as if the bear we had been following had stepped directly into this track but it in no way obscured what we were looking at. These two types of tracks were directly before us so that I can say, as far as comparisons between the two, this new set of tracks had come from some completely different animal.<BR><BR>Following the track, a 2nd track was discernable roughly 4 to 4  feet from the first track across the road. This track was much more degraded than the first track but appeared to be from a left foot of consistent dimensions with the first. The conditions wouldnt allow for any casting and, besides, we had left nearly all of our equipment back at the hotel. This was supposed to have been an in-and-out scouting run and, consequently, we were poorly prepared to document any findings. The spotty snow and the lay of the land discouraged our finding any more tracks and so, snapping too few pictures, we continued up the mountain to the junction near the lake.<BR><BR>I must add, at this point, that our finding of these tracks in no way involved any skill on our parts. This was an instance of pure DUMB LUCK. If we had arrived any later, the quickly deteriorating weather conditions would have destroyed these tracks without our ever having found them. We were extremely lucky to have come across them when we did. It must also be noted that there were no signs of anyone else having come into that area before us. The only tire tracks in the mud and the snow on that road had come from our Jeep. Until we had gotten there, everything seemed to have been completely undisturbed.<BR><BR>Further up, the road splits with the right fork heading toward a camp and the way ahead leading toward a lake. To our left was an animal corral and a short road leading to a dead end in a gravel excavation. These details would be important later but, for the moment, we decided to try forging up the road toward the lake. The way soon became impassable with snow and, having gotten the Jeep stuck a number of times, we turned back to begin our return to Yreka.<BR><BR>Returning down the FS road we were approaching the overlook/turnout where I had heard the strange, AHHHHH! We were discussing this sound when we decided to enter the turnout again, being much more focused and alert this time, to see if it would repeat itself. At 5:35 pm, we put the windows down, turned the Jeep off and coasted into the turnout. Almost immediately the same prolonged, AHHHHH, came from the same direction from which I had heard it the first time. My brother in the front seat said, I heard that!, and we all got out of the Jeep. It was deathly quiet after we had gotten out, but two of us had definitely heard the sound this time as we had entered the turnout.<BR><BR>After waiting a few minutes for a repetition of the noise and getting nothing but silence in return, my first brother asked my second brother to Whoop at the hill which the sound had seemed to come from. I was returning to the Jeep when my second brother let out a bone jarring, Whoop! (a skill he apparently learned on two previous, official BFRO expeditions.) I did not hear it, probably due to my position in the Jeep, but my first brother said that within several seconds of my second brothers having Whooped, 5-6 hard wood knocks suddenly came from the same hillside where he and I had heard the strange vocalization. <BR><BR>We are all very clear on what happened next.<BR><BR>We were all out of the Jeep now, straining to hear if we could catch any more wood knocks when a blood-curdling scream suddenly came from our 2 oclock. It was a very high-pitched, prolonged, almost feminine sounding scream that seemed to be coming from a fairly good distance away. (I dont want to speculate on exactly how far.) The scream did not in any way sound like any type of big cat or some kind of bird. It sounded like a loud, human scream.<BR><BR>It was startling and more than a little unnerving.<BR><BR>My second brother gave another loud, Whoop, but we got no further responses. After the scream, the woods remained quiet.<BR><BR>With absolutely nothing happening, being a little rattled and with evening closing in, we got back into the Jeep and drove to Yreka for the night.<BR><BR>May 11th, weather conditions were beautiful as we drove into the camp trailhead early in the morning to begin our hike into the valley. Temperatures were expected to be near the 70s and the sky was bright and clear. We thought that we would be able to hike the roughly 7 and a half miles into the valley in about 5 hours.<BR><BR>60 lb packs and much more snow than we had anticipated quickly put an end to that idea.<BR><BR>We decided to retreat to our fallback position and attempt an entry from near the lake. We knew from the night before that road directly to the trailhead soon became impassable for the Jeep a short distance beyond the camp junction, but it appeared from our map that it would be a relatively short hike in to the trailhead from where we would have to ditch our vehicle. While we had encountered snow up from the junction, we hoped that it was just a bad patch and that the snow would break and the hiking would be easier once we got through that particular area.<BR><BR>Again, that proved not to be the case.<BR><BR>Stuck now and wondering just how we were going to get into the valley, we realized that we were going to have to make a choice. We could either scrap our idea of getting into the valley from these approaches, take the long drive into Eureka and attempt an entry by going up a creek, or make camp somewhere in the immediate area and attempt a dash into the lake area with extremely stripped down daypacks.<BR><BR>Hating the idea of another long car ride and of wasting another day without getting into the woods, we opted to find a spot close to the camp / lake junction.<BR><BR>Driving the Jeep up the dead end road, past the animal corral, we set up camp in the old gravel pit. <BR><BR>Our camp was situated in a flat, roughly 50 yard in diameter hollow, ringed by rough mounds of rock and gravel. Our GPS indicated that our base camp was sitting at 4,862 feet. Aside from having to hike a short distance downhill for water, our camp offered us a relatively protected haven on the mountaintop.<BR><BR>I want to make our situation clear in light of subsequent events. We did not intend to be where we were. We were forced to make last minute decisions if we were going to try and stay with our original plans of getting into this specific valley. Our position wasnt ideal, but it did provide us with a moderate degree of comfort and a footing for making a dash into the desired area. <BR><BR>We settled into our camp and the rest of the day passed uneventfully.<BR><BR>After a dinner of some MREs, we passed a very quiet and bitterly cold night.<BR><BR><BR>The morning of May 12th couldnt come too soon.<BR><BR>The night before had been almost too much for the gear (20 degree bags and a couple of three season tents) we had with us. I woke up at about 6:30 to winter cold and an icy tent. My second brother was already up while my first brother appeared to have retreated to the Jeep sometime during the night. He had gotten his feet wet before climbing into his bag and had been forced to use the heater in the Jeep to stop his feet from freezing.<BR><BR>We decided to leave him in the Jeep and let him sleep.<BR><BR>At around 8am, my second brother and I decided to gather some snow to make coffee.<BR>As the gravel pit was entirely snow free, we had to walk down past what we had nicknamed the OK Corral to the junction, where there was still plenty of snow. Off to our left, a couple of hundred feet down a very steep decline from our camp, we could hear the fairly loud rushing water of a creek. As neither of us relished the idea of trying to work down that decline and then struggle back up just to get some water, we were going to make do with the snow at hand.<BR>We were just beginning to gather some snow when we suddenly heard the sound of rocks being banged together in the creek bed below us. It was very clear and very distinct. The rocks were being banged together in series of threes. Bang-Bang-Bang. There were always three bangs with equal intervals between strikes. To me, these bangs sounded entirely deliberate. <BR><BR>After the first three bangs, I said to my brother, Did you hear that? He was replying that he had when the rocks banged again. Thankfully, I had brought a Handy Cam with us and I now started shooting. My brother decided to try another of his Whoops to see if we could get any response from whatever was banging rocks together in the creek. He let out his Whoop and after 5 seconds we suddenly heard four loud bangs from down in the creek bed. Again, these were very loud bangs and they were clearly being made by whatever was down in the creek smashing stones together.<BR><BR>This last series of four bangs were clearly picked up by the Handy Cam.<BR><BR>After the last series of bangs, there were no more sounds from down in the creek.<BR><BR>Excited and a little flustered, we rushed back to the camp to wake up our brother in the Jeep. After getting him up, we told him what had happened when we had gone to gather snow. He was excited, but said that he had been sleeping and that he hadnt heard a thing.<BR><BR>A Zoom H2 that wed had running at the time may have picked up the banging in the creek but hasnt been properly reviewed as of this writing.<BR><BR>At roughly 9am, my second brother and I were sitting around drinking coffee and getting things ready for our attempted dash into the lake area. My first brother was walking toward the steep slope on the edge of our camp that lead down into the creek when suddenly a very loud, canine bark startled all of us. The bark sounded like a large dogs, Woof. The sound had come from close below us, somewhere back in the direction of the OK Corral. We all looked up and I fully expected to see a big dog come running into camp being followed by a ranger.<BR><BR>No such dog or ranger appeared.<BR><BR>In fact, we looked everywhere to find the animal that had made that sound but nothing was moving on that mountain. I have heard deer and elk bark and this deep woof was nothing like that. It sounded exactly like the biggest dog in any suburban neighborhood. While that sound wouldnt seem out of place back in civilization, it seemed entirely out of place and strange in our isolated setting.<BR><BR>It was so out of place that we all noted it.<BR><BR>Unfortunately, I had already packed up the Zoom for our hike and completely missed catching the sound.<BR><BR>Cleaning up and shouldering our packs, we struck out for the lake.<BR><BR>We started walking up the forest service road, making for the trailhead. From the trailhead, it would be what we had read was a comparatively easy, little over a mile hike in to the lake. From this lake, we would be within striking distance of a second lake, which figured into two sightings reports from last year (2009).<BR><BR>It seemed pretty straightforward.<BR><BR>It wasnt.<BR><BR>As the road rose up from the junction, the snow got worse. We would go through large patches that would come almost to our knees only to break through to long stretches of bare earth. It was slow going, but doable. If we had known that we would encountering so much snow, we would have been better prepared with snowshoes, poles and full winter gear. As it was, we were going through terrain in conditions we probably had no business to be attempting with woefully inadequate gear.<BR><BR>No one said we were smart.<BR><BR>About three miles in, we encountered a cinnamon bear. Off to our right, coming up quite a steep slope through a section of burn-out, a small to medium (about 200 lb) bear was lumbering towards us. The bear was about 30 yards away and, at first, didnt see us. We stopped and, not relishing the thought of a closer encounter, we caught the bears attention and began to identify ourselves. The bear stopped and a tense five-minute stare down began. The bear seemed to be standing its ground and didnt particularly appear to want to back down. We yelled and tried to make ourselves look bigger, but none of this seemed to impress the bear. I make these points because before me, at relatively close range, I was able to observe a native bear in the wild and to see how this bear would move through these woods. <BR><BR>This becomes important later.<BR><BR>After yelling and waving for what felt like a long time, a can of Counter Assault was produced and we got ready for the bear. Suddenly my first brother, having had enough of this war of wills, shouted an expletive and began throwing rocks at the bear. This did the trick and the bear took off at a run back down the slope.<BR><BR>I say this again to emphasize that I had before me a living example of how a bear looked running through those woods.<BR><BR>We continued trekking into the trailhead, coming across deeper and deeper patches of snow, until we finally reached the true start of our hike at about 2 oclock. <BR><BR>Post holing now into snow at times up to our thighs and waists, it became pretty clear that the inner valley was effectively sealed off. Even though the temperature was in the low 70s and it was a bright, sunny day, the conditions were just too much.<BR><BR>We decided to make some lunch and then begin the hike back to base camp. We made a small fire and had some MREs.<BR><BR>It was after 2:45pm when we started our return to base camp and the going wasnt any easier on the way back. Later, my first brother confessed that he had begun to feel uneasy at the snowed-in trailhead. He had said nothing to me at the time, but he later told me that he had confessed to our second brother that he felt like we were being watched from the moment wed gotten there.  Much later, after wed returned home, he said that, at points, while we had been working our way back down the FS Road from the lake, he had had the strangest sensations. He said that he could feel a prickly feeling along his scalp and that he could literally feel the hair standing up on the back of his neck. He said that hed never felt anything quite like this before and that it happened twice on our return trip. Subsequently, he began lingering behind my second brother and I and videoing longer stretches of the return hike.<BR><BR>Neither my second brother nor I experienced this uncomfortable feeling of being under observation.<BR><BR>Things continued like this until a point approximately 2 miles from the camp /  lake junction on the FS Road.<BR><BR>At approximately 4pm, I was actually bringing up the rear. We were a little tired by this point and we had grown quite loud, laughing and talking. I was raising my hand in a sweeping gesture to finally point at the ridiculously steep grade of the ridge on our right which we were in the process of traversing. As I raised my hand, pointing and making some stupid joke, something suddenly moved on the slope in front of me. From about 30 yards up the slope, something suddenly darted out from behind a tree and ran up the slope to a second group of trees. My first impression was the size of the object. It was big, at least 6 to 6.5 feet tall. My second brother is 62 and it was just about his size, if not a little bit bigger. It was bulky and muscular, and I immediately thought of a jacked-up football player. I could only see it from the waist up, due to foliage on the slope, but what I could clearly see was an upright muscular form running for the trees.<BR><BR> I will elaborate more on this figure in a moment.<BR><BR>My second impression was the speed at which the figure was moving. Whatever it was, it was moving over impossible terrain at a FRIGHTENING speed. I immediately thought that nothing that big should be able to move that fast. It was moving from left to right from one tree up a very steep angle of ascent (I guesstimate a 60 degree incline) at an angle to a second V-shaped group of two trees. It covered 10-15 yards in no time, moving over ground that we would have had to have climbed almost on our hands and knees. Once it reached that second group of trees, it was gone. I do not know what it did or where it went after it reached those trees. I also noticed that, whatever this was, it did not bob as it ran. It looked almost as if the figure were gliding up the slope on a track. I can say with utmost certainty, IT DID NOT MOVE LIKE A BEAR. This upright figure was nothing like the bear we had seen earlier. Whatever this was, it was unique and I have never, before or since, seen anything like it.<BR><BR>My last impression was of its color. The figure appeared to be covered with a uniform coat of hair that was 2-3 inches in length. This hair was primarily of a coyote or burnt sienna color but there was also a lot of grey mixed in. Its fur looked almost brindled, meaning that there was almost as much grey as brown. If it hadnt of moved, I never would have seen it. Standing still, the animal blended perfectly into its background.<BR><BR>All of this transpired in the seconds it took this animal to travel the 10-15 yards between the trees.<BR><BR>Looking back on the figure I had seen, I can say that its form was basically that of an upright human, but there were definitely some gorilla-like characteristics as well. I saw the animal primarily from the side with a great deal of back and shoulders being presented, as if it were turning away from me. It ran with its right arm folded across its face and seemed to be looking over the top of its arm as it moved. I could see no features because of this arm covering its face, but a conical head and the edge of what appeared to be a crest were visible. The animal displayed a pronounced musculature, and I was particularly struck by the sheer size of the bicep, its back and the massive traps. Like a gorilla, I could see no neck. As already stated, the foliage obscured the rest of the animal.<BR><BR>I immediately shouted something like, Over there!, but by that time it was too late and whatever it was was gone.  I cannot stress enough to any one who has never seen an animal like this how profoundly disturbing the speed at which this animal is capable of moving is. I had been holding a Handy Cam on standby and ready to go and I was never able to get off a shot. I believe this is exactly why more of these animals havent been filmed: they just move too fast.  All I could do was stand there pointing with my mouth hanging open.<BR><BR>My brothers asked me what was going on and I tried to tell them. I know that they did not believe me at first. I kept insisting that Id just seen a Bigfoot run up the side of the mountain and, gradually, they started to realize that I wasnt joking. We stood there for a few minutes, gawking and staring up the side of the mountain into the trees, but there were absolutely no sounds or movement coming from the direction in which the creature had gone. My second brother went so far as to try using some samurai  chatter in hopes of eliciting some response from the animal if it were hiding close by, but there was no response. <BR><BR>After about 10 minutes of nothing, we decided to continue on our way back to camp.<BR><BR>I know that this was a decision that will frustrate many people who might read this report and it deserves a word of explanation. On my part, the thought of climbing up that slope to search for prints, hair, or possibly even another look at the animal did not even enter my mind. I must stress that the thought was never there to be dismissed. It was inconceivable. Now, I equate it to sitting in a small boat fishing when, suddenly, something large and unknown cruises under your boat. You do not think of jumping into the water to see what that large thing was. This is not fear. From my brief experience, all I can say is that you do not naturally want to move closer to one of these animals. The reason is as simple as that.<BR><BR>Ironically, although my brothers hadnt seen the animal, they didnt discuss going up that slope either. It just didnt feel right.<BR><BR>From that point on, although we were all keyed-up and anxiously waiting for something else to happen, we returned to base camp without further incident.<BR><BR>It was now sometime after 5pm and we had some decisions to make. Basically, we debated whether or not we should stay or, in light of that days activity, pull out.<BR><BR>We opted to break camp and spend the night in Willow Creek.<BR><BR>This decision also deserves a word of explanation. Our first consideration was the extremely difficult weather conditions that we had been enduring from the start of the expedition. We had been in snow and facing below freezing conditions that we had not been prepared for. The thought of another icy night in the tents or, worse, all of us crammed into the Jeep trying to stay warm were hard trials to think about. While the daytime temperatures were mild and pleasant, the nighttime almost 5,000 feet up in a gravel pit on the top of a mountain was brutal. In this regard, we were not being smart. Our second consideration was the thought of the animal we had just encountered, both directly and indirectly, paying us a visit in the darkness. While my brothers were game for such an encounter, I most definitely was not. This was not coming from fear on my part; I will argue that it was just good common sense. It was definitely going to take me some time to adjust to what I had just seen. In the end, my brothers gave in to my desire to pullout. I am grateful to them.<BR><BR>I still dont regret our decision.<BR><BR>Feeling pretty damn happy with everything wed accomplished already, we ended this leg of our expedition.<BR><BR>Having had some time now to mentally digest what had happened during our short stay in these mountains, my brothers and I have put together some ideas concerning the activity we observed:<BR><BR>1. We definitely feel that whatever was making those AHHHHH! calls on our first day was acting as some sort of sentry or lookout. Whatever was watching the road only called out when we came into view and its position allowed it an excellent opportunity to monitor all possible human traffic into and out of those valley access points. (We did not hear it during our final departure from the mountains but it was getting quite late by then.)<BR><BR>2. Based on the fact that something screamed from a second position in seeming response to the first callers woodknocks, there was definitely more than one of the creatures in the area.<BR><BR>3. Based on my brothers intuitions, my sighting, and a subsequent development, we feel that we picked up something at the snowed-in trailhead and that this something was trailing us from higher up on the side of the mountain during our return hike to base camp.<BR><BR>4. I believe that my sweeping/pointing gesture caused the animal to believe that it had been observed and that this caused it to break and run for new cover. This is the only reason we even knew the animal was there.<BR><BR>I also would like to add a final observation concerning the creature I observed. One of the names the Native Americans of Northern California have for this creature is Tintah-kiwungxoyan, which translates into something like Boss of the Mountain. I can think of no better name for the animal I saw. This animal seems perfectly suited for its environment. It can blend into and move through its terrain at will. Its size suggests a lot of power and its speed is startling. It outclasses us in the backcountry in every possible way. This animal could have, if it had wanted to, taken us at any time and there would have been very little we could have done about it. It definitely deserves our respect and protection.<BR><BR>I would also like to add two postscripts to this report:<BR><BR>1. On May 13th,  we stopped by the China-Flat Museum to see the Bigfoot wing. While we were there, we were talking to Peggy McWilliams from the museum about what wed experienced during our short stay in those mountains. After some interesting comments on her own part about those caves near the rim, she called our attention to a gentlemen who was just entering the museum. This gentleman turned out to be Al Hodgson. After some brief small talk, we told Mr. Hodgson about our recent experiences. He was quite interested and, at several points during our story, actually made the comment, That sounds about right. We showed him the pictures of the tracks and these also seemed to intrigue him. When all was said and done, he very kindly asked us for our names and our contact numbers. As he was leaving, he turned to me with a smile and said, In forty years, Ive never seen one. He was a  gentleman from beginning to end, fascinating to talk to and a genuine pleasure to have met.<BR><BR>2. On May 25th, my second brother was reviewing the footage from his video camera. We had been shooting with two cameras and we had well over 12 hours of footage to go over. While reviewing footage we had shot on May 12th, he came to a portion that he had filmed after our return to base camp from our hike back from the lake trailhead. This footage was shot just as we reentered camp and were facing back toward the mountain and the junction. While it will never convince the skeptical, the video shows something large moving through the trees until it comes to a small clump. The object ducks down and then what appears to be a head pokes out on one side, facing in the direction of our camp. The shot ends after about 40 seconds. <BR><BR>None of us had any idea at the time that the figure was there.<BR><BR>Its an intriguing end to a very intriguing experience. I am extremely happy to have some evidence to support my sighting. In retrospect, I am even more glad now that we didnt attempt climbing up that slope after the running figure. This video seems to suggest that whatever it was, it never moved after it hid behind those trees. If we had climbed that slope, I now believe that the animal I had seen would have been waiting there. In all likelihood it would have run again, but I really would hate to think about having an up-close, face-to-face encounter with whatever was on that mountain. In addition, in light of the fact that this video was shot almost 2 miles further down the FS Road from where I had initially seen the creature, I now believe that this animal waited for us to move and then continued tracking us all the way back to our camp.<BR><BR>While I dont in any way feel that we were in serious danger from this creature, I feel even better now about having spent that last night in Willow Creek.<BR>", :environment "Alpine forest at about 5,000 feet up.

The moon was full, and we were able to do the hike without flashlights. When we got to camp we set up our tents, and then we proceeded to the campfire.  Since this camp is at the tree line, which is about 10,000 feet, you are not able to build your own fire. You are either at the main fire, or in your sleeping bag, because it is cold. <BR><BR>As I sat at the fire, I, and only I, looked down to the meadow that has the trail you hike up on. I knew that my two friends were coming up the trail behind us, so when I saw a large man at the base of the trail (less than 100 yards away) I thought it was my large Native American friend with long hair. I did think that it was strange that he was standing in the meadow alone, without a backpack, at two o''clock in the morning. We looked at each other for a while and then he started to walk off into the forest. I thought that was bizarre also, since it was really cold and again, if you were not by the main fire, you were in your tent.<BR><BR> After wondering what he was doing, I turned my attention back to the fire, expecting my two friends to show up at any minute. Well, they did not show up for another hour. I asked my friend why he was down in the field earlier without a backpack, and our friend, swore to me that they just arrived.

I was visiting Joe and his Mom, because I have known them since I was about five or six years old.  My friend and I took a horse back ride in Humboldt county, up the Salmon River, with a guide that has cabins there.  He takes care of these cabins, and they are about a three-hour horse back ride, up the river.  I met James, the guide, through Joes Mom, because he was staying with her when I got to California. I cant remember Jamess last name.<BR><BR>We stopped after about an hour and a half of riding, to water the horses, which was the Salmon River.  One of the horses got spooked, and was very jumpy, we thought maybe there was a mountain lion around or something like that.  All three of us saw this large ape looking thing walking along, like he was following us, so James jumps off his horse and threw a rock at the thing, but it wasnt startled.  It just kind of backed off into the woods.<BR><BR>We started to ride again, and we were following the river upstream to his cabins, and the river was way below us when we saw a large black ape looking creature down by the river again.  My friend Joe and I were kind of freaked out by the thing, but James said it had happened before and not to worry about it.   We got to the cabins later on in the afternoon, about one thirty or so.  We grabbed our rods to go to the river, because James said, there is pretty good fly-fishing down there.  Joe and I were down at the river, when we saw this thing again.  We took off and told James that it was on the other side of the river, up the embankment, and in the trees.  So, he grabbed his rifle and went to where we were fishing, but it was gone.<BR><BR>So, that night we were sitting on his porch telling stories about what we thought this thing was, when James said that what we had seen was a bigfoot, and he had encountered him several times before. James continued, saying that it goes up into the mountains several times during the summer.  Then we heard something by the tree line, and his horses were jumpy again. So, we just sat there and waited to see or hear anything again. All we saw was a black outline in the trees, which startled us again. <BR><BR>The next day, James''s water supply, from the river, was clogged up somewhere up the river.  He has this thing where the water from the river drains into, and he can get running water to his cabin. So, we all took a walk to see if we could find the problem, and when we found it, the thing that the water drained into was busted up.  It was stepped on by something, and we blamed bigfoot, and thats pretty much it for the story. <BR><BR>James said That it wasnt uncommon to see a bigfoot this time of the year, a lot of people have seen it.  Well, that is pretty much a common thing around there, I guess?<BR><BR>When I got back to North Dakota, I was watching this program on the discovery channel where they were talking about bigfoot, and I saw this same store in Orleans. <BR>", :environment "In the mountains, with pine trees on the ridges, or whatever kind of trees that was there they look like x-mass trees to me.", :fixed_year "2000", :run_time "2022-05-20 16:15:42.000000"} {:nearestroad "Old Oregon Trail", :date nil, :locationdetails "There is a monument or marker near the dirt road where you turn off the main Hwy (about 10 mi. north of Weed).

I became very nervous when my dog stood still, looked away from the house, and growled.

I was a logger for 15 years, in and around northern California, and I was a timber faller, probably 5 years out of that period. Timber falling puts you out in the really remote areas, and we were always the first guys in there to drop the timber. I started working a real thick area, and began working my way back threw the thick woods, my plan was to reach the very back portion of the sale, and then cut my way back toward the logging road.<BR><BR>The first day in there, I had the feeling of being watched, thinking it was just our boss spying on us, so I gave no further thought to it.  The next morning I spotted large tracks in the muddy areas.  It had rained hard that night, so the tracks were not sharp, and they were not from a bear.  Further into the woods, I came up on a flat spot in the faint trail that smelt so terrible, that I almost gagged.  It smelled like wet dog, a very filthy wet dog. Just past this spot is where I spotted what appeared to be human droppings. What was weird about the dropping is they were really huge, not trying to act like an expert on droppings, but the largest piece was about 18inches long, and 3inches in diameter. This really freaked me out, because there was no body else in the area. My partner was working over the other slope, and actually went out another way. The cruisers were out of this area about two months back.  This stuff was fresh looking, about a day or two old, tops. <BR><BR>My partner was a Kroch Indian, and I didn&#8217;t know the guy that well, we just paired up for that season. At quitting time, I sort of approached him about the idea of bigfoot, and he said, &#8220;they have been in these woods for ever, and my people have told me many stories about them.&#8221;  &#8220;You white guys just make fun of what ever the Indian talks about, so we keep it to ourselves.&#8221; And, that was about it. I guess if I took him to a bar on Friday night, and got his tongue oiled up a bit, I&#8217;d have learned a bit more, but I dropped the subject.  We finished the sale and that was it. This area was really secluded with lots of deer sign.  I had a habit of mapping and remembering really good spots for future deer hunting, and prospecting spots that I would use during the winter lay-off.  <BR><BR>This particular spot, after logging, was strictly off limits, as it was part of the Fruit Grower Company''s land, and after logging they would lock up the roads. It didn&#8217;t matter how long you logged their property after a sale it was shut down, and you had to stay out!   Well, hunting season arrived, and I breached the locked gate, and snuck in there for a day of hunting.   I took along my ever-present companion, Pappy, my hunting cow dog.  Him and I were inseparable, because he didn&#8217;t know fear, and would attack a grizzly if you didn&#8217;t keep him under control.  He had a good nose, and located many a deer that got away from me. <BR><BR>Well, we got into the same area that I had spotted the droppings, and Pappy went on purple alert.  His fur went straight up and he acted totally weird.  He came to a halt and refused to go any further down the trail. I never saw him act quite this way!  Just 100 yards up the hill I spotted movement.  It was crouching down behind a buck-brush bush, and it just crouched there staring at us.  It was completely unnerving!  I realized I was illegally in that area, and this might be another hunter, or a DFG cop ready to bust my butt.  Note, guys were always getting busted for hunting on the California line or the Oregon line. It was just a bad spot, and it was so close to each border, it would be up to that game warded. <BR><BR>Well, I had a Remington rifle, in a 270 caliber, with a 3x9 scope, and not really wanting to aim a rifle at another hunter, I sort of swept the total area, like I was looking for deer.  What I saw chilled me to the bone!  It was not human, and that&#8217;s about all that I can really say!  To this day, it looked like a king sized Eddy Munster, and it didn&#8217;t look ape like, but it sure as hell wasn&#8217;t human.  The eyes, were what got my leg&#8217;s going, because I wasted no time getting back to my truck and getting out of there. <BR>", :environment "Thickly forested, with lots of mountains, streams, and creeks, and a very few roads.", :fixed_year "1979", :run_time "2022-05-20 16:15:43.000000"} {:nearestroad "Coffee Creek Rd/ Hwy 3", :date "Multiple dates", :locationdetails "Go north on Hwy. 3 from Hwy. 299.", :submitted_date "2001-08-30", :sketch 0, :bfroid 3056, :otherwitnesses "Four separate witnesses on different occasions", :run_id 34, :nearesttown "Coffee Creek", :styler_highlight_1797 0, :timeandconditions "It was broad daylight/ dusk", :month "0001-07-01", :county "Siskiyou County", :state "California", :fixed_month "0001-07-01", :submitted "2001-08-30 00:00:00.000000", :title "Young man has three different footprint observations and one short encounter with a large black creature over a three-month period", :otherstories "While we were camping at Big Flat campground, some other Big Foot enthusiasts showed up in early part of July, having plaster prints from various Northern California areas.", :year "2001", :season "Summer", :class "Class A", :alsonoticed nil, :url "http://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=3056&PrinterFriendly=True", :observed " My story begins in the early part of June when I took a job at Josephine Creek Lodge.

The Klamath and the Marbles are particularly rugged and steep terrain. <BR><BR>I hiked from Etna Summit at the PCT trailhead and looped all the way through the Wooley Creek drainage, attempting to get to the Cal-Salmon River. My attempt failed and I hiked to Little Elk Lake and on out to the group of lakes outside of Lovers Camp trailhead for the full distance. <BR><BR>On day one I hiked over 14 miles on the PCT south from Etna SUmmit. On day two I left the PCT and hiked to a large marble outcropped ledge above the Wooley Creek drainage below a large, unnamed peak. (I can consult my map for a definite location, but do not have one available at this exact time). The night of my second day out, I slept on this nice marble ledge, beside a small creek about 2 feet wide that was more of an ice drainage from the steep, glacial peak above. This creek ran down the ledge and off a cliff that is about a 200 feet drop to a boulder field below and about 800 feet (or more) down to the Wooley Creek drainage. The 200 foot cliff below the ledge is VERY steep and to a tradational climber would be rated at least a 5.9 or 5.10 chaucy climb.  <BR><BR>So, there I was, in my purple Marmot bag, all cozy and tucked in. The night was clear and was about 4 days before the full moon in late August, so it was bright. I was sleeping parallel to the little brook running along the Marble Ledge and about 15 feet from its banks. I fell asleep and woke up to a wierd noise that was very far away. I was already frightened of animals because I was by myself. It does not matter, but I am also female. I was scared out there by myself. But having the time of a life. <BR><BR>The noise so far away seemed to be way down in the forest in the Wooley Creek drainage. It was loud, however, almost like a yelling or a whooping. It was consistent and occured one yell after the other. I didn''t worry too much, and was not concerned because it was so far away. The yelling truly happened one after the other. And, it was getting louder and perhaps closer. I still was not concerned as it was far enough and I was atop a huge cliff, so I felt safe and unreachable. However, the yelling got louder and closer yet, and started to travel up the boulder field below. At this point, I had heard the yelling for 20 minutes. Again, it was a consistent howl, or whoop, over and over again. I just laid still in my bag and realized that not only was this yelling thing was coming up the boulder field but coming up the cliff. Sure enough the creature was climbing up the cliff. AND FAST! The whole event was this thing running and hooting/inward drone yelling up the drainage, up and up to the cliff and beyond to the top of the peak. Sure enough when it got to the cliff it pulled and climbed itself up \"swiftly and agile\" as I put in my journal. It literally dyno''d every move on this 5.9 cliff and yanked itself up the cliff to the top where the ledge was, where I was. The creature, in the mean time, was still consistently calling/yelping/hooting. It got to the ledge and started running toward the peak above. As it got closer, I pretty much urinated in my sleeping bag. But I just laid still; I was extremely frightened. As it started to approach the ledge close to where I was, on the other side of the brook, I could see it. It was a silhouette of a huge running gorilla. It ran on two legs but dragged and pulled with its arms. It was huge. The arms were almost the length of half its body and was covered in hair. It was black, but I really only saw a silhouette. The head reminded me of the abominable snowman from the Christmas, Rudolph movie. <BR><BR>It just ran and howled, but then stopped slightly when it was parallel to me. It stopped howling, and slowed down slightly, and kind of hesitated. It turned its head toward me as if smelling something, but then immediately turned forward and really started running even faster. And louder and faster and then climbed up to the top of the peak and called and called for nearly four hours straight. Until almost sunrise. I stayed awake the whole time.

This hike was during the second session in early July.<BR>We had completed the major stretch of the four hour journey when we came over the ridge and could see East Boulder about 3/4 of a mile below. <BR>There were 4 councilors and about 25 boys and girls ranging in age from 9 through 15. We had stopped for a last gulp of water at a clearing just below the rim of the ridge when several of the campers began to squeal excitedly and pointing at the steep slope directly to the northeast and to the right of us. Not more than 50 feet away at the same elevation stood an erect hairy creature looking right back at us. One of the kids yelped, \"It''s a bear!\" Tim, one of the councilors, muttered, \"That''s no bear.\"<BR><BR>The details are still vivin in my memory. The creature was leaning against its left arm which pushed it out from the canyon wall. The right arm swung back and forth as if for balance and it bobed its head irregularly. It was about 5''6\" tall, covered with long reddish brown fur with a large flat face and round yellow eyes. During a discussion later, Sunny, who was studying biology at UC Davis, insisted that she observed the creature to have a hairless chest with large round protruding nipples. This led her to conclude that it was possibly female.<BR><BR>The creature held its ground for a little over 1 minute before it spun around and ran away from out group upward towards the rim to the right of us. As it ran it sent a landslide of skree down into the valley below. When it reached the ridge it turned and peered back at us once again and then disappeared over the edge.<BR><BR>Much excitement followed and the decision to continue down to the lake and set up camp was made. Curiously, there didn''t seem to be a trace of fear among the children although all the councilors, myself included, did admit later to being afraid.<BR><BR>The first thing after dark that I noticed was a powerful odor that came from the Ponderosa grove. The closest comparison I can come up with is that the smell is skunk like but muskier with a hint of urine. The entire camp began to get a whiff of this odor and the animated discussion about the sighting during the afternoon became hushed. In the quiet we could hear landslides from a number of different places midway up the ridge, a dim green light about the size of a small grapefruit. The odor intensified and the snapping of branches not more than 10 yards away sent the whole bunch of us into a cluster around the fire. The odor was intense when a large shadow figure took several long deliberate strides through a gap in the trees. It had to be about 7 feet tall. I saw this creature only once but others in the group saw several dark forms over the next 2 hours.<BR><BR>Shortly after midnight an 11 year old boy in the group began to complain of great pain in his lower abdomen. This pain increased over the next hour to the point that he was laying on the ground pulling his legs up towards his chest. The councilors agreed that it appeared that the camper was having an appendicitis attack. We drew sticks and Larry and Tim headed out in the dark back to the main camp to bring a stretcher with a four wheel drive truck to the logging road just over the south ridge. Sunny and I remained with the group, some of them sleeping and others tending the campfire. At the point when Tim and Larry''s flashlights were no longer visible, the odor departed as well and the night became still and quiet.<BR><BR>The next morning shortly after dawm, Tim Larry and Warren, the camp director, arrived at the camp with a olive green military stretcher.<BR><BR>Warren would later question every member of the group.

It''s not that I didn''t believe, I''d just believe it when I saw it. <BR><BR>It was a very warm, almost hot evening just after or before labor day in 2007. It was dark, around 8:30 or 9:00 PM but the sky was still a little lit up in the West that time of year.  I was on patrol, driving W/B on Hwy 128 out of Cloverdale going to an alarm call out at some ranch property.  Those calls are very common.<BR><BR>As a law enforcement officer, you notice things out of place.  A car here that wasn''t parked there yesterday, a person walking along the road in a desolate area, lights on in a closed business....things like that. Things just catch your eye that other people don''t notice. Like I said, I was driving W/B and saw someone coming up out of the ravine onto the roadside. I can''t describe it...I just saw the movement in the brush and knew it was someone.  People run from us all the time and I thought I may have surprised someone who might be growing marijuana in the woods or something like that. It happens a lot here.  I saw the outline of a body, the reflection of my headlights in it''s eyes and it ducked back into the scrub brush before I passed it.  <BR><BR>Thinking it was someone trying to avoid or hide from me, I hit the brakes and backed up quickly.  That''s when I saw it in my headlight beams.  It was about 6-7 ft tall, thick matted brown fur and walking upright. I did not see the face, it was walking away from me but slowly.  Like everyone else says, I couldn''t believe what I was seeing.  It was definitely something I was not gonna put out on the radio. There were a lot of branches and overgrowth in the way, but there was no mistake on what I saw. <BR><BR>I specifically remember two things.  One was that it had small leaves and grass matted into its fur all over its back. I saw that as it walked away from me.  I remember that vividly. Second, I remember that it used slow, deliberate movements.  It walked away and used its arm to swipe small limbs and twigs out of its way.  I saw it from the backside for a good 4-5 seconds before it disappeared into the overgrowth again.  I then got out of my car and stood there for about 2-3 minutes with the engine off.  I could hear the same slow movements and crunching of leaves and sticks for a while. I could hear it down there making its way into the creek area.  Everytime I stopped hearing it and would start to walk back to my car, I''d hear a \"Crunch\" in the distance and I''d listen a bit longer. <BR><BR>There is a creek down in that ravine which is probably where it went back to. <BR><BR>Needless to say, I told no one.  This wasn''t something to bring up in briefing or to put in the patrol blotter. That would make for an extremely long and uncomfortable career for anyone.  <BR><BR>A friend of mine from back East told me about this website.  I didn''t know who else to contact.

I lived at the house by the levee in my childhood years 1965-1968. Immigrants had a shack against the levee and always had a gather for the weekend. One day my Mom was out to show the Men how she could shoot her New 22 Ruger rifle at the tin cans. After all the fun, a man was just having an idea if he could just use the rifle on Saturday morning for cottontails, Dad and Mom was happy to let him use it !  Saturday came around and I noticed the home made rack with  cottontail and Jack Rabbit hanging upside down near the small cabins to the side of them. My brother told me to go with him and check them out! it was sad to see such a kill. That evening the men showed my Dad how beer batter makes a good rabbit roast over the fire, and we all had a share of the food with wild rice and flour tortillas. <BR><BR>This went on for two weeks, then a problem occurred! Someone was stealing the rabbits from the rack ! Since our family was the only one in the camp, we where most likely the blame. My Dad was beat-up at a card game as beer caused a climax over the rabbit issue, and I could not stand to see it. I was not afraid of anything cause I never watched any TV in my life about scary stuff, so I had no feeling for that in that direction. I went up the levee to just to look around and I saw a rat-snake. I ran down and told Mom about the snake, Mom said not to go back up again. it could bite me!. but my curious mind took me back up the next day.<BR><BR>I walked up the levee looking down to the right side where I may have seen it last. When I got to the top , that was it... No snake. Then in the silence of everything but the soft breeze blowing a bit in my ear, I saw something moving in front of me. this huge Monkey like creature on a cottonwood tree, looking over the levee. I noticed it in the shade of the upper branches because one of its legs was swinging back and forth below the branch. I got closer to adjust my focus on this big creature and sure enough it was some sort of ape like thing but with a smaller head and it had human like features. I looked down to see if there was a fence between us, and there was not any fence at all ! My mouth was watering over fear and I could not move my legs. I found a way to turn around and get off the levee! As I went down the levee, half way down I started to run and never looked back. I told my Mom about what I saw and she stopped cleaning and told me to just shut and lock the doors. My Mom was now thinking of the rabbits that had gone missing and told me food left-out makes animals gather for more. <BR><BR>We never went over that levee again .

We always went with my girlfriend Darla''s family. It was a lot of fun.  My friend Darla and I would go for long walks in the woods.  We loved to see how many animals we could find.  We''d see everything from chipmunks to rattlesnakes.  We saw a lot of deer, too.  Probably more than our fathers ever saw. <BR> <BR>     We usually walked up an old logging road for a couple of miles and then we would turn around and go back to camp.  <BR><BR>     One time, I think the year was around 1968 or 69, we had invited another friend, Shirley, to come camping with us.  All three of us girls were in our early teens.  Darla and I decided to take Shirley out and show her where we always took our walks.<BR>  <BR>     We walked and talked for along time.  Seeing all kinds of animals along the way. We were laughing and just having a good old time, like teenage girls do.<BR><BR>  We ended up walking a little farther than we normally did.  Then we decided to go off the road and walk down the hill a little bit.  We came to a creek and we started walking on the rocks to cross it.  The creek was about 8 to 10 feet wide, so it took several steps to get across.<BR><BR>     After we got across, we saw on one of the rocks, a big red lizard.  None of us had ever seen a lizard like that before.  It kind of scared us, so we thought we''d better start heading back.<BR> <BR>     That was when we saw two hunters walking up the hill, the same way we were going.  We stopped and let them go ahead of us.  They said hello, and went on up.<BR><BR>      Because we had walked so far, we started to feel like we were lost.Then we really started getting scared. <BR><BR>     I''ve always had a good since of direction, but I was getting a little worried, too.  Then I remembered that we had walked up and down two hills and when we got to the top of the third hill, we then walked down the north side of the hill to the creek.  I reassured my friends that I knew exactly where we were and that we would find our way back just fine.<BR><BR>     That was when I saw it.  I didn''t know what it was, I had never seen anything like it before.  It came down the hill about fifty feet to the left of where the two hunters had just gone up.  It stood two feet taller than the men we had just seen.  It''s whole body was dark brown, like it was covered with fur.  At first I thought it was a bear, but It didn''t walk like a bear.  It walked like a man, upright and swinging it''s long arms.  I remember the top of it''s head looked flat like it had a top hat on, the kind that Abraham Lincoln would have worn.  It moved quickly and quietly and in no time at all, it had come down the hill and crossed the creek.  The same creek we had taken several steps to cross, it crossed with just one step.  It disappeared into the trees so fast, that I was the only one to see him.  I was so shocked that I couldn''t say anything.  I just stood there with my mouth hanging open until he was gone.  But I never felt afraid the whole time.<BR><BR>     When we got back to camp, my dad had just came back to camp from hunting all morning.  I told him all about what I had seen and he said that he had been on the other side of the creek around the same time that we were there, which was around 12:00 PM.  He said that he didn''t see anything but he heard a loud sound like a large wounded animal breathing real heavy.  The same sound that he had heard several years before on another hunting trip at a place called Brush Creek.  Then he made the sound for me.  It gave me chills.  It sounded asthmatic, like loud moaning breathes.  He admitted to me that he was very afraid both times he had heard it, even though he was standing there with a deer rifle in his hands.<BR><BR>     A few years later, my family and I were watching T V and a program came on about Bigfoot.  It was suppose to have actual footage of a real Big foot.  I had heard of the legend of Bigfoot, but I always thought that it was just that, a legend.<BR>  <BR>     When I saw the footage,  I got those same chills all over again.  I jumped up and yelled \"That''s it, that''s what I saw!\"  It looked just like what I had seen, except they said that the one on T V was a female because it had breasts.  The one I saw didn''t and it looked taller, too, so I''m guessing it must have been a male.<BR><BR>     It''s been over 30 years since I saw whatever it was I saw, and I can still see it as clearly in my mind as I did then.  Whenever I tell this story to friends, they always laugh and joke around with me like I''m making it up or crazy or something.  I just tell them, \"You don''t have to believe me.

In September 2003 (maybe the second week of that month) I was dispatched with 22 other people to the Del Loma Fire in the Shasta/Trinity Forest area, the Northern part of California. Each Crew had about 20 people, our plane that left Albuquerque held 2 crews. For almost the whole two weeks, we were all on standby. On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire. It was close to sun down when, a couple of guys were amazed at something. I heard them from inside my tent, but just ignored the whole thing until one of my crew members came and pulled me out of my tent. <BR><BR>I had no idea what I was supposed to be looking at or for. He pointed across the river and I was in shock when he pointed out the biggest, hairiest mammal I had ever seen just walking along the river side minding his own business. It stopped and looked at us. The way he stood on his hind legs was like an ordinary human. He had dark, long hair and stood about 7ft tall with a muscular build. <BR><BR>At this point I was the 4th person standing there in amazement. Maybe about 5 minutes of watching him watch us, with more people coming out with flashlights (because the sun was still going down) he darted in to the trees. He was running, taking long strides, and was gone in about 3 seconds.....and was literally pushing trees out of his way (not breaking them, but  pushing them out of his way). The trees behind him on his path up the mountain were swaying back and forth. I was surprised to see to these trees moving because they are thick in width and very tall. <BR><BR>By this time it was dark but lit enough to see which way he was headed. Up the mountain a little, there was a clearing, where we spotted him again before he disappeared for good. He made no noise, no yelling or screaming. He was just as timid as can be.<BR><BR>I have heard many stories about Bigfoot, and known that they are real but when seeing one in real life....you get a sense of respect for them and just have that feeling that there is more to life than you know. <BR><BR><BR><BR>", :environment "Huge mountains, lots of pine trees, bush, a huge river nearby, The great Outdoors.", :fixed_year "2003", :run_time "2022-05-20 16:15:57.000000"} {:nearestroad "Trinity Dam Blvd.", :date "Sunday, 10/1", :locationdetails "Out by Lewiston Lake", :submitted_date "2000-10-05", :sketch 0, :bfroid 405, :otherwitnesses "I brought my wife back to the area and we video taped the area and the footsteps and took pictures.

The creature had an observable stature of at least 8 feet, but the head itself was never seen. The creature was illuminated by the peripheral glare of our Mazda Navajo''s low beams as my wife was loading the car from the passenger side door. We have photographic evidence of the creature in the form of footprints found along the road side above the campsite which clearly show a difference between an uphill gate and a downhill gate. The creature seemed to walk down, then up a small distance, and then down to cross the road. It left a great variety (about 20 or so) of prints in different positions of locomotion over the terrain. We have photos of this trail as well as closeups of the clearer prints with a measurement reference next to them. <BR><BR>The events where as follows: <BR><BR>My wife and I were returning to our campsite from dinner at a restaurant in Lewiston at about 10:00 p.m.. As we entered the campground we noticed that our campsite was disturbed. For being a windless night, there was no reason our 8 man dome tent should have been on its side with the contents spilled out on the ground and under the tent itself. We are in the habit of keeping everything in either the car or tent when we leave so there was nothing else to mess up there. Another thing is that the tent was zipped up when we left and now was open. <BR><BR>We parked and inspected the area around the sit to see if anything was missing. After everything was accounted for, we decied that it must have been restless teens from the area just having \"fun.\" At this point we decided to pack up and get a hotel room in town. <BR><BR>Now this is important; my wife and I had been camping already for about three weeks as we were on a vacation. We had decided early on that if we saw or heard anything (like a bear, etc...) we would just say to the other calmly, \"as fast as you can, please go to the car.\" <BR><BR>My wife and I uprighted the tent and she grabbed the pillows and took them to the car as i started to roll up our sleeping bags. After being gone for about a two minutes i heard her say \"Steven, as fast as you can, please just get to the car with the keys!\" She said it calmly but I instantly could tell there was something really wrong with her. I dropped everything and just went to the car, started it and we backed up and drove to the entrance of the campground.. <BR><BR>Now this is what she saw. As she was putting the pillows in the backseat of our truck on the passenger side door (the camp was on the drivers side) she saw some movement off in her peripheral vision in the glow of the headlights about 15 feet from her. At first she thought it may have been a deer as we had seen several earlier that day in the area and so she calmly closed the door enough to shut of the interior light and looked at the area of the movement. The creature then appeared to stand up and started to walk away from her direction toward the rivers edge. She only saw it for about 2 secondes but saw a definate human like shape and (mostly its back and left shoulder) and the impression of brown coloring. We also both recall a strong odor in the area that we could smell at times but never paid any attention too. <BR><BR>We discussed what happened (she was almost hysterical with fear) and I turned the car around and drove back and around the site with my highbeams on. One feels a slight bit invincible in a big vehicle, even from big animals. We saw nothing, but nevertheless we put everything in the car without even packing it and left. That night we ended up driving to, I believe, Redding which is 30 miles or so away and staying there in a hotel. <BR><BR>The next day, we returned with a camera (a Kodak disposable 35mm.) to the site and explored. We have shots of myself standing where it stood with my hand held up at the level she saw its shoulders and lucky enough it was under a major branch of a tree. The propotions of this thing really amazed us when we realized its size next to the tree. It apperantly had approached and squatted at the base of this tree and watched us, and we are sure that it was what had gone through our tent and that we probably had startled it by retuning when we did. After those photos were taken and a search for footprints was given a go ( the earth there was very, very hard and gravelly) we decided to look up by the road as there was a good enbankment running along its length that the thing had to have crossed to get to our site. <BR><BR>About a quarter mile up the road toward the damn from our campsite was a trail as plain as day on the hill side. We got complete photos of the trail and several shots of a very clear print near the asphalt itself on level land. it is about 1 inch deep there where i (at 150lbs) did not leave a trace of one myself.

I suppose the nearest Hwy would be Hwy 34 that goes through Loveland (about 20 miles away).  We had bought a small piece of property and were building a bridge across Buckhorn Creek.  We took a break and my son, Dallas C, was scanning a mountain to the west of us with his binoculars when he saw it.  My daughter-in-law grabbed the binoculars and looked, and she said, \" It''s chasing some deer,\" then, \"My God, Mom, it''s got knees!\"  She said it ran into a group of pine trees.  I got my binoculars and we stood quietly and waited.  Several minutes later it leaped out from the trees and went running across the face of the mountain.  I swear, that thing could run like the wind, and this was rugged terrain, but it had a very strange, destinctive gait.  The friend that was with us saw it without binoculars.  I guarantee you it was not a fake.  There is absolutely no possibility that it could have been.  No human could run that fast,  especially across that rugged mountain, and it was at least seven feet tall.  What is puzzling is that it didn''t seem to fit with things I have read about them.  This one was pitch black, not redish brown, and it was seen in bright daylight in the middle of the day.  It was chasing deer, which I think would rule out it being a vegetarian.  Another thing I thought really interesting was that a huge bird, maybe a vulture of some kind kept circling around where the thing was, like maybe it was waiting for it to make a kill.  My son insisted that it had a tuft of snow white hair on its head.  We didn''t report this sighting because we didn''t think anybody would believe us, plus, we didn''t want some gun-happy nuts trying to hunt it down.

We were hiking the High Sierra Trail from Bearpaw Meadow over the summit into the Kern River valley. We had made quite a distance the third day out (about 18 miles) and were exhausted when we stopped at a small lake called Morraine Lake high above the Kern River valley. We had seen no other hikers the entire day. As we were sitting in camp at dusk, the quiet was pierced by an unearthly screaming howl of immense volume, emanating from some distance away from us, but carrying quite clearly in the still air. It sounded as if it came from some animal with huge lung capacity, and could not be confused with human, a bear, or any other sound I had ever heard. The outburst only happened once and trailed off rather than stopping abruptly. Although clearly not human, it somehow seemed sad in tone rather than fierce or threatening. <BR><BR>\"Did you hear that?!\" my brother asked. \"I sure did,\" I replied. \"What do you think it was?\" he then asked. \"I have no idea,\" was my response. We were so tired that we just climbed in the tent and took our chances with whatever was out there. By morning we had forgotten about it. It remained forgotten for days until we got back to civilization and were having a meal of \"real food\" at a local diner. The newspaper I was reading carried a story about three men who were repairing a footbridge in the Golden Trout wilderness area of the Kern River for the U.S. Forest service. They were experienced woodsmen, one was a 60-year-old Mono Indian. They were frightened severely at dusk one evening by what they described as a nine-foot-tall hairy beast coming down a hillside at them screaming loudly. It was a classic Bigfoot sighting, except it was way out of the normal geographic range for sightings, since the Sierra Mountain range was not believed to be a typical Bigfoot area. They fired a shot over its head with a 30.06 rifle, and were so upset that they packed out to a Ranger Station that night and made a report to the ranger. <BR><BR>The ranger scoffed at them, and surmised that they had seen a bear or cougar. They replied that they knew what bear and cougars looked and sounded like, and that THIS creature was different. Way different! The ranger accompanied them the next morning to the sight and saw some large footprints in gravel, but nothing like a cast could be made from. I checked the day and place that these men said this happened and you guessed it, it was the same day that my brother and I heard this weird screaming howl, perhaps 5-8 miles away.

I say now because for along time I blocked it out of my mind. Sometime in the early morning hours I left the tent to visit the latrine, which was maybe fifty yards away at the edge of a small ravine. As I was standing there relieving myself I began to hear small limbs and heavy brush breaking just on the other side of the ravine. My first thought was that a steer or cow was over there, and I quickly directed my flashlight beam in the direction of the sounds. What I saw Froze me in terror. It looked to be about seven maybe eight feet tall, covered with long shaggy brown hair and kind of teetering back and forth on it''s two feet. The head was very large with no neck to be seen, and the eyes about ten to twelve inches apart,with round glowing orange appearance. The arms were very long, and hung straight down.<BR>I turned and ran back to the tent, wetting myself all the way.

The cabin is about six to eight feet off the ground and the only way in is by using wooden stairs to climb into it.<BR><BR>There was plenty of snow and we were warned about walking on the porch.

I turned over thinking just that.<BR><BR>Moments later, I felt movement again but this time it felt like someone was walking on the porch.  I sat up to look around and did not see anything or anyone.  <BR><BR>I decided to use the restroom since I was awake and eventually found my way back to bed.  It was then that I noticed something moving by the porch light. At first, I thought it was a man with long brown hair, but then noticed that it had hair on its arms and back.<BR><BR>After a better look, it had hair all over its body, but it seemed more of an orange-brown color.  Frightened as can be, I just kept looking at this thing.  It had its back towards me for several minutes and then slowly turned to look in my direction.  I was about twenty feet from the window so I am certain that it did not see me.  It leaned over to see through the window.  <BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t<BR>I would estimate it to have been about six foot six inches tall.  Its weight was about three hundred pounds and well proportioned.

They seemed to be dark brown.  <BR><BR>The beast was frightening when it turned and looked in towards the window.  Its chest was like that of a male and I am assuming that it was not quite a grownup yet.  It was searching for something but I dont know what.  I also noticed that our friends dogs were no where to be heard or found in the cabin.<BR><BR>After a quick scan of the room, it turned and headed towards the porch rail.  Eventually, it jumped from the porch, which was a six to eight foot drop.

We had been on the road sometime and were still responsive but tired. As we passed a tight hairpin turn we had not said anything for hours because of the monotonous trip.

Our location was Eagle Meadows which is above Strawberry, California off of California Highway 108. It was a sunny, cold day.  We dressed in our camoflauge and began our hunt.  We were deep in the woods had climbed down a hillside of boulders and into what looked like a perfect hunting area.  Forest on either side of a meadow approximately 300 yards wide. We found pine trees to sit under (they had low branches) to await our perfect buck and so put on our skunk scent. My husband was approximately 10 feet away from me.  We each had views across the meadow.  But I could not share his nor could he share my view for there was a clump of trees and bushes about 100 yards in front of us and positioned between the trees we were under.   About 20 minutes into the hunt we heard branches breaking across the meadow.  My husband quietly told me to be aware of bears.  To stay alert.  It was approximately 10:30/11:00 a.m. when I looked back across the meadow and saw something that wasn''t there 3 to 5 minutes ago.  Immediately, I thought \"Could it be a Bear?\"  I rationalized if it was only shadows from trees, a dead log with light coming through?  But none of my theories fit. The image I saw was black.  The sun was shining from behind it so the front looked black.  Then I thought \"It must be a Sasquatch.\"  I saw most of his head, 3/4''s of his chest area and down to what could possibly be the waist.  The rest was hidden by the trees/bushes.  After totally analyzing the figure, the blackness, I thought if it is a bigboot it must have eyes.  I brought my small camouflage binoculars up to my eyes slowly and looked across this meadow.  It was then that fear and anxiousness prevailed.  For I saw two yellow eyes watching me very intently.  I have never been so scared.  I was afraid to move an inch.  I continued observing for about 15 minutes and he stood there and watched me too.  We were both very still.  I was wondering if he would move, why he was so intent on observing me?  Then my instinct told me to move and get out of there.  I motioned to my husband that I was going back to camp but did not tell him why.  My fear didn''t allow me to speak.  My intent was to leave the area as quickly as possible. I high-tailed it back to camp.  Up the stoney hillside and through the woods all the time looking over my shoulder.  Later when my husband came in I asked him if he saw anything unusual?  He said he didn''t.  So the Bigfoot didn''t walk across the meadow or my husband would have seen him.   The Sasquatch found me.  I was there under that tree first, minutes before he came into the area.  I honestly believe without a doubt that this was a Sasquatch.  I do not believe that it was a dangerous threat to me or it would have advanced towards me.  I do not believe it was a bear because a bear would not have stood still for so long.  I wonder if these creatures are just as about us as we are of them.  If only I could go back to that point in time.  I would have slowly moved across the meadow towards it, to see what it would have done and to investigate farther.   My husband said, \"What would you have done if it charged you?\"  I said, \"Run and scream.\"  My point is, how will anyone ever know the truth if they don''t cautiously and tamely approach one.

I ran out of my tent to where the horses were and shined my flashlight. All my horses were tyed up and staring up at the top of the hill very upset. We didn''t hear or see anything else so we went to bed. The next morning there were footprints going up the hill like whatever it was had two large feet with a big toe. The next evening at dust we tyed our horses up in the meadow. Our camp was about 300 yards away when we heard a loud sound like the horses startled something, we looked up to see some huge thing running extremely fast across the meadow away from the horses in a cloud of dust. We ran over there and one horse was so scared it had jumped over another horse while they were tied up. So we tyed the horses up in the orginal spot and never heard another thing on the trip. We stayed a week and we felt very stange like something was watching us. There were no animals in the area no birds, squirrels etc etc. We were in the middle of nowhere and we would hike around our camp and there would be stacked rocks little bunches all around the area and the next day they would gone.

My judgment  was very clear at the time of the sighting and so what I think it was is a very intelligent creature with tremendous speed and strength running like a man and covered in dark hair from head to toe. Lying across ways of the ravine were many fallen trees and so this creature was breaking the branches of these trees while running as fast as a deer would be seen running.

The account may be somewhat fragmented in presentation, as I want to provide a narrative that portrays the events of the day. Additionally, I prefer to provide a narrative and let people draw there own conclusions.<BR><BR>First, I recall finding the remains of a fawn in the meadow I wa surveying. Nothing unusual about that, in-and-of-itself...ties-in later.<BR><BR>As I continued to conduct my survey, perhaps thirty minutes or so afterwards, I noticed movement off to my right. What I saw was what appeared to be an animal covered with black, semi-long hair (two to three inches, to guess), walking upright (fully) with a gape somewhat like the current hominids; and approximately five to six feet in height and weighing one hundred seventy-five to two hundred twenty-five pounds.  I saw something move for two or three steps.  It did not appear to go anywhere (but just moved) but of sight.  It did not look at me or react to my viewing, it just simply appeared and then was gone.<BR><BR>To some extent I was not really paying attention to my surroundings, as I was focused on my work; but was enjoying the surroundings in that field sort of way.  I recall thinking that that looked like an upright creature walking through the woods.  I tried to repeat my last movements, to see if what I saw was a play on light and shadows.  I was not able to re-create any likeness of what I had seen - the light and shadow of the forest did not seem to be the source of my observation.<BR><BR>I did not hear anything.  Either before, during, or after, in regards to the sounds that one might hear if someone were walking in the woods stepping on branches or simply rustling the ground.  I did not take an active interest or pursuit, as I was uncertain of what I think I really saw;  I am skeptical by constitution; not only for mythologies, but in general.<BR><BR>Although I did play the event in my mind while I finished my survey.  And occasionally looked in the general vicinity of the area of where I saw the animal-creature-mythological being.  I finished my survey and left the area.<BR><BR>While I was returning upstream, approximately one hundred meters from the meadow, I came across an exhausted buck - two or three year old lying on the ground near the creek.  I was able to approach and touch the deer.  I clearly recall brushing flies off his head and sitting next to him for a couple of minutes and thinking this is pretty cool! I was courious about the deer and did think about what I had seen in the meadow.<BR><BR>I then proceeded upstream again.  Approximately one hundred fifty meters from the buck I came across a mass of tissue, which looked to me like an aborted fetus.  Upon further investigation, I discovered that it was the entrails of an animal.  Very fresh.  I then looked behind me a saw a freshly killed doe.  Her eyes were still clear and there were no flies or maggots on or in the carcass.  As I examined the doe I could find no sign of struggle. I was unable to locate any apparent method of kill by another animal; thinking of a cougar, which usually will bite at the base of the skull or that general area.  I found no such evidence. The carcass was left fully in the open.  What I did notice was that the right leg had been cleanly ripped off from the main body to include a couple of ribs. There was no blood anywhere.  I looked around as my in-the-woods instincts were quite active. There was that six sense of a presence.  I spent awhile running all of the pieces through my head and thought that this was pretty cool and funky.  I then continued to hike out to Bloomer Lake, taking the experience with me.<BR> ", :environment "Forested area near a shallow lake.", :fixed_year "1993", :run_time "2022-05-20 16:16:18.000000"} {:nearestroad "Highway 108", :date "25", :locationdetails "Specific location available to BFRO researchers.", :submitted_date "2001-03-07", :sketch 0, :bfroid 1919, :otherwitnesses nil, :run_id 34, :nearesttown "Sonora", :styler_highlight_1797 0, :timeandconditions nil, :month "0001-10-01", :county "Tuolumne County", :state "California", :fixed_month "0001-10-01", :submitted "2001-03-07 00:00:00.000000", :title "Friends have night sighting above Sonora", :otherstories nil, :year "1983", :season "Spring", :class "Class A", :alsonoticed nil, :url "http://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=1919&PrinterFriendly=True", :observed " On or about oct.25th 1983, a friend and myself went to look at a three wheeled motorcycle from an ad above Sonora, CA. We arrived in late afternoon, met the lady that wanted to sell it. We entered a fenced area w/a large gate. The area was about thirty feet across [hard packed red clay], w/ an old shed to the right against some manzanita brush. To the right was a trail through the brush leading to a cabin [unoccupied for years] and unfinished. It was built against the side off a hill where you could walk into it from the trail but when you looked out the window off the main room it was about a forty-foot drop [it was partially on stilts] to the ground. I am an outdoors person, hunter, fishing, hiking, etc., but I didnt feel good about this place. We had trouble starting the trike and I recommended leaving it, but my friend wanted it badly and the lady persuaded him to stay the night in the cabin and she would rent a trailer the next day. We went to Sonora for dinner and came back about 8:00 pm. We pulled into the gate [the lady lived about an eighth of a mile up the mountain in a mobile home]. As we exited the 1951 GMC P.U. and walked towards the trail, the brush to the right of it parted and out stepped this huge figure, like a man but taller [we are both 6 feet tall] and wider. It was a dark night but it was darker than the brush and silhouetted very well. It was about ten to twelve feet away and looked right at us. My friend jumped into the truck and I pulled my bowie knife out and swept it back and forth as I backed onto the hood of the truck w/out turning away from it. It casually turned to its left and started across the clearing towards the shed.

We were there for two weeks in our 21'' travel trailer, and I was completely bored out of my mind!  I also had just started menstruating for the first time while we were in the middle of our trip  (mentioning this seems weird, but will make sense later). At the campground I met a little girl, a few years younger.  She had been living there with her parents who were without a home.  She showed me a trail that went way out into the woods where there was a small stream (only a few feet wide) with a big rock.  If you climbed up on top of the big rock, there was a tree branch that you could grab onto and swing over the stream.  We played there for a good while and returned to the campground when it started getting dark.  The next day I looked for my friend, but she had apparently moved on with her family - her campsite was empty.  I figured I''d go back out to the stream and play for awhile since I had nothing better to do.  The stream and rock area was a little further than a city block out into the dense forest.  The whole trail was shaded since the pines were so thick.  I merrily went out into the woods, with absolutely no hesitation, looking forward to some fun.  When I got within about 5'' to 6'' from the big rock I had the strange feeling someone was watching me. The hair on the back of my neck stood up a bit. I still was not afraid and began looking around me (thinking maybe my friend was out there playing somewhere close by and hadn''t left as I had thought).  I looked in front of me and slowly turned counter-clockwise peering into the dense woods.  I continued turning until I was looking directly down the small footpath I just walked to the rock.  As I looked at the pathway, I noticed a very large pine tree that was edging the path had a funny looking \"arm thing\" wrapped around it''s middle.  I looked - still not afraid - and was trying to figure out what the heck it was; I could make out long fingers and very dark furry brown hair covering the entire \"arm\".  I thought to myself \"that''s not a branch, and it''s not a bear''s paw, it sure looks like a HAND!\"  Now, this tree was approximately 15'' from where I was standing, and DIRECTLY next to the pathway I had just come from.  As I continued to look at the \"arm\" - still not afraid since in my own mind I kept thinking it couldn''t POSSIBLY be an arm even though it sure looked exactly like one...I saw a face peek out from the opposite side of the tree and look at me.  It was a very flat face, very dark brown - couldn''t make out any features except the eyes, which were looking right at me!  Let me tell you, I was never very athletic, but as soon as we made eye contact I don''t think my feet touched the ground!  Worse yet, I had to run right BY IT to get the heck outta there!  I FLEW back to camp and ran into the trailer.  I didn''t tell my mom or dad about it since I thought they''d think I was crazy.  Needless to say, I stayed in that trailer for the rest of our vacation at Sugarpine. When I mention I started my period for the first time, I believe animals have an uncanny ability to sense and smell those types of things, maybe it caught wind of me and decided to follow and check me out.  The creature was hunched over a bit, so it''s hard to tell exactly how tall it was, or if it was a juvenile.  I do know that the pine tree it had it''s arm wrapped around was around 4'' wide in circumference - which makes it a pretty long arm!

I cocked the hammer back on the .32 caliber carbine, shouldered the weapon, and began to press the trigger.  Something in my mind ordered me to not shoot the creature!  I call it Devine intervention.<BR><BR>     I asked myself if this was a bear?  No, I instantly decided that it didnt look like a bear because there was not a long, protruding snout jutting out from the face.  Besides, bears were not legal game in this area of California.  It certainly was not a buck, never mind the fact that if it was a deer there were no horns on this animal.  I immediately told myself it looked like a monkey man.   <BR>    <BR>     I can hear myself today saying these words out loud:  What the hell is a monkey doing out here in the mountains?  In the meantime, as I made the move to shoulder the carbine, and spoke those words, the big animal turned towards me from the waste up.<BR>  <BR>     Looking over the sights of the little carbine, I observed this being to be about 7 or 8 feet tall, with well-muscled, long hairy arms hanging down to the waist. The hands looked almost human; I remember noticing these things as I slowly put down the gun. <BR> <BR>     This creature was completely covered in long dark, brown hair, from head to feet and appeared to have a huge, barrel chest.  Some other striking features that I noticed were a flat, square jawed face; a flat, dark looking nose; no noticeable hair on the face; and a sloping fore head.  I dont remember seeing any sign of ears on the animal  too much long hair around the side of the head  and there was no discernable neck. <BR> <BR>     Since I had no idea what this creature was, Ive always been glad to have instantly decided NOT TO SHOOT IT!  Thank God for protective Angles?  The other thing I thought about, at the time, was this could be some idiot in a monkey suit playing a prank on some hunter like me.  But, then, only a village idiot would dress up in a monkey costume and roam around the mountains during deer hunting season.   <BR> <BR>     As I contemplate the incident today, I realize now that this was a Bigfoot!  And, it had both seen and heard me.  I could not tell what sex it was because of all the long, dark hair around the body.  However, now that I have seen numerous showings of the Patterson film in which Pattie was documented, I must guesstimate it was male in gender?   <BR>      <BR>     Within 10-15 seconds, as quickly as the creature had entered my field of view, it calmly made about two strides across the open fire lane, parted some tall bushes with well-muscled, uplifted hairy arms, and disappeared into the thick bushes.  <BR><BR>     Right away I noticed that it was now standing inside the screen of thick brush along side of the fire land like it was watching me.  I could readily discern the huge dark shape, as it stood there for possibly a minute or so.  Apparently, it was looking at me sitting up the hill on the ground.  I didnt know at the time whether it was going to attack me or leave.  I kept the little carbine in the ready position across my chest and slowly stood up to get a better look at this unknown animal.  <BR><BR>     I decided at the moment when I stood up that, that if this thing would charge me, I was going to run back up the hill to my dad - unless it got too close to me.  Then, and only then, would I consider shooting the animal!  I admit it  I was scared fit to wet my pants.  I now recall seeing the bushes shake violently and the dark shape stepped out of sight.     <BR>    <BR>     I slowly sat down again and listened to its rustling footsteps as the huge ape-man descended down the hill away from me.  Boy was I glad it was gone.  Now the shakes started.  If I had been smoking in those days, I would have lit a cigarette and probably smoked the whole pack.  <BR>        <BR>     Finally, after about 15-minutes, when the stillness was broken by singing birds and scurrying chipmunks, I got up enough nerve to carefully go down to the spot where I had seen this creature.  Was I dreaming?  No, because there, in the loose dirt, I saw a couple of huge, human-like, barefooted tracks where it had crossed the fire line.  <BR><BR>     Then, a raunchy odor hit my nose.  I remember thinking it smelled like a horrendous fart.  In fact, at the time, I decided to call it the Fart Creature.  I know, that is not a very endearing name for such a marvelous being, but thats how my scared brain was working that fateful morning.  <BR><BR>     Deciding that now would be a good time to leave the area; I quickly walked back up the hill to where I had been sitting and stood there for a few minutes.  Clearly, I had seen something unexplained.  Now I had to decide if I should tell my dad or just keep quiet.  To tell you the truth, I was afraid to tell my father because I knew he would never believe me.  I thought he would most certainly take my hunting privileges away for seeing buggers in the hills. <BR>      <BR>     I began slowly walking back up the firebreak towards my father in the piney flats above me.  I remember now that he had asked me why I had left my deer stand so early.  I think I replied that I was hungry and bored at not seeing a buck right after daylight.  He probably chewed me out for leaving so early, but, at least, I didnt incur his wrath for telling a bugger story!  <BR><BR>     Honestly, for many years I forgot about this incident.  I had to go back to military school the next week and the ensuing years later my life was filled with other things.  Of course, I really never did totally forget about seeing a Sasquatch!  It was only later on in life, after getting married, serving in the military, and leaving California for Florida, that this sighting began to trouble my conscious.  <BR><BR>     How I kept this a secret for this many years I will never know.  I guess I was frightened that people would think I was crazy?  Usually, Im the blabby type, sharing plenty of secrets with almost anybody, especially family or friends.

It was then that we noticed, right across the ravine from where we stood, a tremendous amount of crashing through the aspens.

It was very tall, at least eight feet. It just stood there on two legs looking straight at us. I could not see its face. The sun was at its back and its face was in silhouette. But, I could tell that the face was very dark. The head and body were large and were not built like a bear. We stood and watched this animal and it watched us for several minutes. It stood on two legs at all times and sometimes it rocked back and forth. At that time I assumed that this was because it wanted to get our scent or to get a better view. We then decided to run for it. We came down the hill at breakneck speed, and were scolded  by our parents who thought we could have broken a leg running so fast down the hill. My parents claimed it was a bear. But, I have been hunting and fishing these mountains for thirty years. I have never seen a grizzly bear in this part of the state. I have seen grizzly bears before and their fur is brown.  The color of the fur on this animal was unlike anything I have ever seen.   Again,It was very long and golden in color.

We parked on highway 6 where it crosses the continental Divide and hiked south along the divide for about five miles.  We meandered down into one of the valleys carved into the divide on the eastern side.  We were looking for pioneer artifacts from the many who passed through this area on the trek to California.  <BR>\tWe had descended below the tree line where the valley peteres out into a boggy meadow.  This meadow runs down to a stream to the immediate east.

Dense brush and tree cover run along the opposite bank.  <BR>\tWe began to hear what we thought were noises from a large animal across the stream.  We tried approaching the source of the noise, but as we moved closer the sound moved away downstream along the opposite bank.  I started catching glimpses of a large, hairy, brown and black animal and thought we were following a bear.  My friend had the same idea and our pace slowed to a halt.  The animal then moved a little closer to us and appeared to watch us for several seconds.  Its height made it look like a bear reared up on its hind legs.  It then turn and moved off downstream through the brush in a long, loping, two legged gate that would have been impossible for a bear.  We did not care to follow.  <BR>\tAdding to my belief that what we saw was not a bear or other wild animal is the fact that my dog did not bark or show any of the aggressive excitement he usually displays upon encountering a wild animal.  He actually drove an adult black bear, which was pillaging garbage cans, out of a campground several years ago.

Track casts were not made because of the poor condition of the tracks at that stage.  The measurements and photos clearly showed that the tracks were not superimposed bear tracks.<BR>  <BR><table align=center width=311 border=1><tr><td align=center><span style=\"text-align:center; font-size: smaller; color:white\"><a href=\"/AVEVID/PHOTOS/TRACKS/trackscene.jpg\"><img src=\"/GDB/CNTS/CO/EG/trackscene1.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=311 height=200></a><BR>Photo of track path<BR>(Click on photo for larger version)<BR>Note: Close-ups of individual tracks below<BR></span></td></tr></table><BR><BR>The area of the track site is north of White River National Forest and Holy Cross Wilderness.  <BR><BR>Track site is accessible from two approaches: <BR><BR>1) By wading across the Eagle River<BR><BR>2) By crossing private land or hiking down a steep brushy hillside from a road approximately  mile above.  <BR><BR>The Sheriff himself did not make it to the site until some days after the find because of the difficult access to the site.  Bill B. lives about  mile west of the site, and fishes that stretch of river often.  He mentioned that he has seen only one other fisherman in that area this year.  It is not an area used by the public, and therefore an unlikely place for a prankster to leave fake tracks for someone to find. <BR><BR>In checking with Forest Service contacts in Colorado I learned that Holy Cross Wilderness Area occasionally receives sighting reports from visitors. There are reports from this area extending back over 100 years, including an 1881 article in the Leadville Chronicle newspaper. Reports made to state and federal government employees in Colorado are typically disregarded and not documented. <BR>  <BR><BR>Overview of the Tracks <BR><BR>There were three (3) discernable tracks at the site.  They were not consecutive tracks. The labelling of the photos (track 1, track 2, and track 3) represent the order in which they were photographed. <BR><BR>Track 1 proceeds in an easterly direction, parallel to the south shoreline of the river. At this point there is an abrupt left turn by the animal, toward the river bank. <BR><BR>Track 2 is north of track 1.  It is also a right footprint. The intervening left footstep between tracks 1 and 2 is not clearly discernable in the soil, and was not photographed by Bill B.  <BR><BR>Track 3 is a left footprint -- the next footstep after track 2.  <BR><BR>The heel-to-heel distance between tracks 2 and 3 is 38 inches.  The next footstep after track 3 would have brought the foot down into the river.  If the animal had continued in an easterly direction, paralleling the river, for another step or two, it would have walked into some softer soil where tracks would have been much more visible. Apparently it prefered to walk in the frigid river rather than the softer soil ... <BR><BR>Some bigfoot investigators have described other track finds where the individual appeared to avoid leaving tracks where possible.<BR><BR><table align=center width=552 border=1><tr><td align=center><img src=\"/AVEVID/PHOTOS/TRACKS/trackmap2.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=552 height=591></td></tr></table><BR><BR>Evaluation of Tracks<BR><BR>The most common potential causes were eliminated by visual examination:<BR><BR>Human footprints <BR>Bear tracks <BR>Superimposed human footprints <BR>Superimposed bear tracks <BR>Hoaxed tracks  <BR>Tracks of a real animal are distinct from those that a hoaxer would be able to produce. Without revealing all the elements one looks for in trying to identify fake tracks, I can say these tracks had none of the obvious signs, nor any of the more subtle signs. They were clearly produced by real feet on a very large, heavy animal.<BR>  <BR><BR>Misidentified Bear Tracks? <BR><BR>Colorado has native black bears. Adult black bears leave tracks about 4.5 inches wide. The toes are arranged in an arc around the front of the foot pad, on both the front and rear feet.  The largest grizzly bears in the world -- Kodiak Island (Alaska) bears -- leave tracks up to 8 inches wide at the toes. The shape is roughly similar to those of black bear tracks.  The largest Kodiak grizzly tracks are about 14 inches long on the hind foot. <BR><BR>Track #2 at the Eagle River site is a bit more than 9 inches wide at the toes, and 18.5 -19 inches long.  Only the extinct Short-Faced bear (Artodus Simus) had feet as wide as those at the Eagle River site. The shape of the tracks and pattern of toes at the Eagle River site is somewhat human-like, not bear-like.<BR> <BR><BR>Hoax? <BR><BR>The location of the tracks factors in when evaluating the possibility of a hoax. These tracks were barely noticeable, in a hard-to-reach part of a remote area. Hoaxers put tracks where people will find them. Or they put them in an unlikely place then \"discover\" them themselves. Bill B. discovered these tracks while fly fishing. He wasn''t trying to draw attention to himself. That''s why he reported them to the Sheriff''s Department, as opposed to the media. The Sheriff Department recommended that he report the matter to the BFRO.<BR><BR>Bill B. is a respected businessman in the Vail area. He thought the tracks should be documented by someone, and thus his report.  The wildlife officers and law enforcement officers who observed the tracks for themselves, and considered every reasonable alternative, did not believe the tracks were hoaxed.<BR><BR><table align=center width=289 border=1><tr><td align=center><span style=\"text-align:center; font-size: smaller; color:white\"><img src=\"/AVEVID/PHOTOS/TRACKS/track2.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=289 height=465><BR>Track #2 (right foot, toes extended)<BR></span></td></tr></table><BR><BR>Track #2 is the clearest track of the three that are discernable. At first it appears to be the track of a giant human, with a foot more than 18 inches in length.  It is 18.5 - 19 inches long from the anterior tip of the big toe to the posterior of the pressure ridge left by the heel. <BR><BR>The first toe digit (the big toe) soil impression is roughly 2.25 inches wide and 3 inches long.  <BR><BR>The second toe impression is roughly 1.75 inches wide and 3 inches long.  <BR><BR>The third and fourth impressions are roughly 1.5 inches wide and 3 inches long.  <BR><BR>The fifth digit (pinky toe) impression is over 1 inch wide and 2.5 inches long.  <BR><BR>All five digits appear to have been extended forward to near maximum length in this track.  <BR><BR>The best and clearest photos of this track show a tape measure laid along the inner edge of the track impression (see photo above). The toe prints are made in a thin layer of decaying vegetable matter overlaying a soil/gravel mixture.<BR><BR>In the heel portion of the foot, there is a small ridge of gravel raised at the 12.5 to 14 inch mark that peaks at about 13 inches from the tip of the big toe.  This rise that transverses the track is the result of heel strike when the foot is placed during normal walking motion, in that the heel throws up a small pressure ridge of soil material when it comes in contact with the ground.  The foot then rolls over and presses down on this ridge, thereby compressing it somewhat. <BR><BR>One of the angular stones in this ridge''s apex was pushed backward about  inch by the pad after it had been pushed forward by the heel.  This is what one expects from a flexing foot in a gentle slow step. Several other subtleties in the soil compression marks show that the tracks were not &#8220;drawn&#8221; in the ground. Rather, the marks were created by substantial forces from flexible, powerful, articulating feet.<BR><BR>Weight calculations based on the track depths and surface areas, comparing the measurements to those of the people who went to the site, show that the animal weighed at least 900 pounds.<BR><BR><table align=center width=353 border=1><tr><td align=center><span style=\"text-align:center; font-size: smaller; color:white\"><img src=\"/AVEVID/PHOTOS/TRACKS/track1.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=353 height=508><BR>Track #1(right foot)<BR>Track #1 shows the toes tightly curled as the animal turns to the left.<BR></span></td></tr></table><BR><BR><table align=center width=327 border=1><tr><td align=center><span style=\"text-align:center; font-size: smaller; color:white\"><img src=\"/AVEVID/PHOTOS/TRACKS/track3.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=327 height=433><BR>Track #3<BR></span></td></tr></table><BR><BR>I can provide many more details about these tracks to anyone engaged in genuine academic research on this phenomena, or to state or federal wildlife officers.<BR><BR>", :environment nil, :fixed_year "2000", :run_time "2022-05-20 16:16:47.000000"} {:nearestroad nil, :date "4", :locationdetails nil, :submitted_date "1998-08-10", :sketch 0, :bfroid 1350, :otherwitnesses nil, :run_id 34, :nearesttown nil, :styler_highlight_1797 0, :timeandconditions nil, :month "0001-08-01", :county "Conejos County", :state "Colorado", :fixed_month "0001-08-01", :submitted "1998-08-10 00:00:00.000000", :title "Report of a field investigation over several days", :otherstories nil, :year "1998", :season "Summer", :class "Class A", :alsonoticed nil, :url "http://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=1350&PrinterFriendly=True", :observed " REPORT OF A FIELD INVESTIGATION <BR>by Richard D. McCuistion, Sr., Chilton Williamson, and Keith Foster <BR>  <BR>Between 4 and 7 August 1998 we began a long term study in a drainage thought to be the summer range of the Sasquatch(s) described by Foster in the Big Foot Research Organization&#8217;s geographical data base for Conejos County, Colorado.  Our purpose was to spend at least six days in the study area to establish our presence deep into, what we thought might be, the home range of the creature and to familiarize ourselves with the area.  Exact locations within Townships 35 and 36 North and Range 4 East will not be divulged here because of the area&#8217;s importance to us as a long term study area.  Also, it is not recommended that anyone, other than serious researchers who coordinate their activities in the area with us, venture into this area <BR>because of its remoteness and the unusual occurrences that we experienced. <BR><BR>The study area is heavily timbered with slopes ranging from about 10% (6) to over 100% (45) and elevations ranging from 9400 feet above mean sea level (MSL) to over 12,000 feet above MSL.  The off road terrain is extremely rough and suitable campsites are almost nonexistent.  The soils are granitic, very firm, and not particularly conducive to animals with soft feet leaving discernible tracks -- shod horses weighing 1,000 pounds or more generally left slight hoof impressions in the surface of the dirt road.  The study area is summer range for an apparently sizable population of elk (Cervus elaphus).  The cow elk and their calves that I observed were <BR>numerous, well fed, and healthy.  I believe that this population serves as a prey base for the alleged resident sasquatch(es) as well as other large predators including man.  No evidence of bears was seen on this trip, but that does not preclude them from existing there. <BR><BR>The first twenty-one hours spent in the study area by Williamson and me were uneventful.  We found a suitable campsite that had a fire ring and other evidence of recent human usage -- possibly by seasonal elk hunters.  The campsite lay between dense forest and rising terrain on the north-northwest, east and southeast sides and a large wet meadow that drains into the _________ Creek on the west side. The meadow covers an area of about 230 acres and is oriented on a northwest-southeast axis.  It was about 250 yards wide west-southwest of our campsite. <BR><BR>At 16:00 MDT, 5 August 1998, Williamson and I heard five distinct primate-like calls apparently originating from an 11,000 foot high ridge north of the campsite.  The vocalizations resembled those of a large man rising from a low pitch to a higher pitch before ending -- something like \"Uuuuhhhhaaaa - Uuuuhhhhaaaa\" and were similar to the vocalizations that I <BR>heard near Leadville during the early morning of 23 October 1994.  The vocalizations stopped before they could be recorded.  To our knowledge, no other humans were within four and a half miles of our campsite.  A possible hiker&#8217;s camp was observed by us as we drove into the area the previous day. It was approximately four and a half miles southeast of our camp and was <BR>next to the access road and a pack trail leading up to _______Peak.  This camp was located at about 9400 feet above MSL and the intervening, rough, and heavily wooded terrain rose to over 11,000 feet above MSL.  By road, the distance between camps was greater than seven miles.  At about 16:30 MDT, we were joined by Keith Foster and his son Andrew.  We discussed the <BR>vocalizations and it was noted that our campsite was about ______ miles from the site of Foster&#8217;s scream encounter of June 1994. <BR><BR>At about 01:40 MDT, 6 August 1998, Williamson was awakened by an undetermined disturbance.  Since he had decided to keep his horses in their trailer that night, it may have been their movements in the trailer that awakened him.  At about 01:57 MDT, he heard a vocalization coming from nearby that sounded something like \"Ahhhh - uuuhhhh\" -- a diminutive, rhythmic, and almost conversational form of the vocalization heard the preceding afternoon.  Also, this vocalization was repeated several times and was followed by a pair of low, sharp clicks as if two hard objects or rocks were being struck together.  Foster also heard the clicks.  The vocalization seemed to emanate from a small ridge less than a quarter of a mile northeast of our campsite.  Unfortunately, Williamson was unable to awaken me sufficiently for me to corroborate his observations. <BR><BR>After daybreak on 6 August, we observed several elk cows and their calves grazing on a bench about one half mile southwest and upslope of our campsite.  Several bulls were observed bedded down above the timberline on the east-northeast slopes of _______Peak.  After breakfast, we conducted a brief examination of the area north of our campsite, but nothing unusual was observed.  Foster and his son departed to examine the bait sites that he had established near the site of his scream encounter.  These bait sites were established in mid-July 1998 and were designed to collect hair samples and hand prints.  Williamson and I rode the horses further down the drainage following a closed logging road.  We rode about one and a half miles down-drainage before coming to the end of the closed road.  We found the road washed out and impassable by vehicle.  At the road&#8217;s end, we found a major game trail that continued down the_________Creek drainage, but we elected not to follow it because of the deadfall and snags which made going impossible for the horses.  While at this location, I took the opportunity <BR>to pound rhythmically on a hollow log with a large rock for about 30 minutes;  my effort, however, elicited no response.  We retraced our path to our campsite and rode beyond it to an old clear-cut.  The exact date of the cut is not known, but it shows up on the aerial photography taken on 29 August 1989 as a recently disturbed area.  This clearcut is now an open meadow with slopes of about 10% to 20% and is covered with a generous growth of grasses, sedges, and some pine saplings ten or twelve feet in height. Numerous cow and calf elk tracks, along with recently used beds, were observed throughout this area. <BR><BR>At 18:03 MDT, 6 August 1998, numerous and sustained primate-like screams or roars were heard by Williamson and me reverberating around our campsite. The direction from which the vocalizations emanated could not be determined, and the quality of the calls seemed to have a definite edge or harshness over the vocalizations heard the previous day.  They sounded something like \"Rrrrraaaahhhh - Rrrrraaaahhhh!\".  These vocalizations lasted for about four <BR>minutes and, again, I was unable to record them.  The horses were securely tethered to the rear of their trailer and we turned in for the night at about 22:30 MDT which coincided with the rising of a full moon. <BR><BR>At about 02:00 MDT, 7 August 1998, Williamson and I were awakened by Foster&#8217;s vehicle alarm system, which caused a few moments of pandemonium, and Foster shouting, \"False alarm!\".  He then advised us of the events preceding the alarm&#8217;s activation.  He stated that he had been awake when he began to hear a rhythmic rock-clacking 50 to 100 yards north of the <BR>campsite.  The sounds of two rocks being struck together began at about 01:40 MDT.  He described the sound as having a definite cadence of one strike per second and lasting for a period about twenty seconds.  He observed that the horses were fully alert , extremely nervous or frightened, stamping and snorting and both of them were trying to position the horse trailer between themselves and the source of the rock-clacking.  There were no slopes around the campsite steep enough for a dislodged rock to tumble down and duplicate the steady cadence that he heard.  Upon hearing the clacking and observing the fright exhibited by the horses, he attempted to lower the window of his sport utility vehicle in order to hear better, but inadvertently activated the alarm system which caused Williamson and me to respond to the emergency with weapons at the ready. <BR><BR>The events leading up to the alarm were discussed, especially the horses&#8217; exhibited behavior.  They are experienced mounts for deer and elk hunting and have been used on numerous such hunts to pack out downed game.  They have also been exposed to bear which, according to their owner, frighten them considerably.  Foster expressed the opinion that no further incidents <BR>would be forthcoming because of the noise made by the alarm and our activity and then he retired for the night.  Williamson and I decided to maintain a listening watch.  Within 45 minutes after activity in the camp subsided, the horses began to alert again and, with the aid of a sound amplifying device, Bionic Ear, stealthy, creeping footfalls could be heard.  Although the <BR>device had a directional parabola, there was enough spurious background noise from over-flying jet aircraft to make precise directional orientation difficult; still, the footfalls that I heard were definitely not the thudding noise made by the horses or other hoofed animals as they walk.  It <BR>became apparent that the horses were confirming what I was hearing and that they were giving us an accurate bearing on the intrusions.  The horses never alerted toward the meadow on our open west-southwest flank. <BR><BR>To aid us in our surveillance, we also used a pair of night vision goggles, but despite a full moon and the unit&#8217;s infrared spotlight, viewing into the shadows wasn&#8217;t very productive because of the jumble created by branches and snags.  A four celled Mag-Lite was also used to pan suspected areas and at about 04:00 MDT red eye-shine was detected.  The eye-shine appeared as two <BR>parallel, reddish pinpoints which winked off and on at about the same visible plane as the base, and to the side of, a lone tree growing on the southwest rim of a small swale.  The swale began about 15 yards north of the horse trailer and was approximately 25 yards in diameter.  A person of average height standing in it would be unable to see over the rim and into our campsite.  The eye-shine&#8217;s color was consistent with the red or orange reported by Grover Krantz (\"Big Foot-Prints\", 1992), while the color of the eye-shine cast by the horses was lime green.  Despite a full moon and clear meteorological conditions, no grazing elk or other nocturnal animals were <BR>observed at any time during the night.  (An absence of browsing deer and nocturnal animals was previously reported by me in my report of the alleged sasquatch screams and response calls that I heard near Leadville, CO in October 1994.)  The meteorological conditions then were basically the same as on the morning of 7 August 1998.  Moonset occurred at about 05:30 MDT. <BR><BR>The intrusions occurred at intervals of one every 45 to 60 minutes and always began with the horses alerting in a different direction toward the forest around us.  Stealthy footfalls and movements would be detected and we would wait until we were absolutely sure that an animal was close by; then we would unzip the tent&#8217;s insect netting and pan the suspected area with the <BR>night vision goggles or the Mag-Lite. An interesting, and I believe important, observation is of the horse&#8217;s behavior preceding successive intrusions.  They were becoming more accepting <BR>of whatever was encroaching upon our campsite.  Bears are ruled out because they were not observed and the horses did not exhibit the fear reaction they are known to show in a their presence. <BR><BR>After daybreak, the area around the campsite was examined for tracks and other disturbances.  The ground&#8217;s surface was, as stated previously, very firm and fairly even, with a layer of pine needle duff under the trees and grasses and sedges in the open areas.  Rock outcrops occurred throughout, and the open areas were moist from a heavy dew and a light rain shower from <BR>the previous afternoon.  An animal&#8217;s bed was found about 90 yards north of the campsite under a tree above the northern rim of the swale.  This position or bed provided an excellent, but screened, view of our campsite. The bed was dry and appeared fresh, and I did not observe any hoofprints or footprints in or around it although the soil and duff were disturbed.  There <BR>was no detectable odor in the bed.  Foster picked up two base-ball sized rocks and struck them together to demonstrate the sound he had heard earlier that morning.  The noise he produced startled the horses and elicited their undivided attention during the demonstration. <BR>  <BR><BR>Conclusions: <BR><BR>1.  Primate-like vocalizations were heard on three separate occasions between 5 and 7 August 1998.  The vocalizations heard in the afternoons of 5 and 6 August 1998 could not have been made by a human without the aid of a megaphone because of the dense forest and vegetation <BR>which quickly attenuated sound.  These vocalizations lasted for a period of not more than five minutes each occurrence and were definitely produced by a living animal and not by a tape player.  The vocalizations heard on 5 August had, as interpreted by Williamson, a \"Heads up or general announcement\" quality to them, whereas those vocalizations heard on 6 August were more like \"Now hear this!\".  The vocalization heard during the early morning of 6 August had a conversational quality to it and was followed by a pair of low, sharp clicks which were also heard by Foster. <BR><BR> 2. The footfalls and movements heard with the Bionic Ear were consistent with the night movement techniques that I learned during my training as a combat infantryman.  The technique was, basically, to place the toe of your boot carefully but firmly, avoiding branches, twigs, or dry <BR>leaves, and then gradually shift your weight to that foot so as to minimize the sound of vegetation being crushed or soil being shifted.  It is apparent to me now that the tent&#8217;s zipper broadcast our alertness and the panning spotlight confirmed it. <BR><BR> 3.  The horses that we had with us were, initially, invaluable as an early warning system, but they seemed to become accepting of whatever it was that kept encroaching upon our campsite.  It appeared to their owner that they were beginning to show the same interest in the intruder(s) as they did when one of us approached them. <BR><BR> 4.  We were not subjected to the same sort of intimidation or threat displays, such as screams, and thrashing of vegetation that others have reported in their sasquatch encounters.  This difference in behavior could have been due to our numbers and the nature of our presence in the area.  We all carried firearms, we actively scouted the area, we made drumming noises <BR>on a hollow log, we didn&#8217;t hunt the elk that abounded the area, and we remained vigilant during the night. <BR><BR> 5.  Williamson and I had the distinct impression that we were dealing with an adversary rather than a curious and semi-intelligent animal. My conclusion is based on my personal instincts and experience as a former Marine who has seen some combat and Williamson&#8217;s was based on his \"gut feeling\" as he had no previous experience with anything like this.  We <BR>independently noted the change in the quality of the afternoon vocalizations between 5 August and 6 August, the use of non-verbal communication in the form of rock-clacking, and the repeated probing of our campsite on the morning of 7 August 1998.  The rock-clacking could be interpreted as a form of close range communication intended to mimic naturally occurring sounds <BR>which would not tend to alert a quarry.  According to Foster, such communication is sometimes used by bow hunters when hunting Bighorn Sheep (Ovis canadensis) and Mountain Goats (Oreamnos americanus) because they tend to disregard the sound of falling rock <BR><BR>6.  The probing of a position is a complex, aggressive, and hostile act that is used to determine the strengths and weaknesses of an adversary. It is my opinion that the use of this device could only be made by an intelligent, sentient being or beings of potentially dangerous capability or intent.  Although there are no recently documented incidents of anyone being <BR>attacked by a sasquatch(es), the above described occurrences, the Ape Canyon incident described by John Green (\"On The Track of the Sasquatch\", 1980), and the reference to chimpanzee hunting behavior described by Jane Goodall (\"The Chimpanzees of Gombe: Patterns of Behavior\", 1986) caused my personal warning flags to go up.  Keith Foster&#8217;s \"gut feeling\" was that the encroachments on our campsite amounted to nothing more than simple curiosity. <BR><BR>7.  After considering all of the events leading up to the night of 6-7 August, Williamson and I decided to cut short our planned stay and to leave when Foster and his son left for their home in Kansas.  It was clear to us that our campsite could not be defended because of the surrounding <BR>terrain and forest and we did not want to test the intruder&#8217;s intelligence and tactical ability with just two people and a pair of increasingly relaxed  horses.  If we had, indeed, been probed the night before, we were obviously under constant surveillance and it would have been readily apparent to an intelligent being(s) that it had the advantage. <BR><BR>8. Although no conclusive evidence was found that would support a claim that our campsite had been visited or probed by a sasquatch(es), the area warrants further, and careful,  investigation which we intend to,  systematically, accomplish. <BR>", :environment nil, :fixed_year "1998", :run_time "2022-05-20 16:16:39.000000"} {:nearestroad nil, :date "13", :locationdetails "Conejos County, Colorado...sighted on Lake Fork of the Conejos, on the Lake Fork foottrail, about half way between Big Lake and Rock Lake...sighting was made from the eastern branch of the Saddle Creek logging road...line-of-sight distance approx 2.5 miles SSE of Platoro, Colorado I was on the logging road, about 0.25 miles lateral and 1,000ft or so vertical distance from the Lake Fork trail when I made the sighting...we were standing on a rocky overlook next to the logging road which allowed a good view of the Lake Fork Valley, including Big Lake and Rock Lake", :submitted_date "1997-07-25", :sketch 0, :bfroid 1352, :otherwitnesses "My wife and I had been driving slowly along the logging roads looking for elk.

They were walking at a fairly normal speed. What I would say to be 400 or 500 yards in front of them was a large, black object moving in the same direction--away from the hikers--at a much faster speed. It was not on the trail, but instead in the meadow next to the trail. It seemed as if it was spooked by the hikers. I''d say it was about a half mile from me, and 1000 or so feet downhill, so I couldn''t get a really good guage on how big it was. Although, judging its size against the hikers, it was clearly much larger than a man. There is no question that it was bipedal; not once did I see it move quadrapedally. This was definitely not a bear. As it appeared from my vantage point, I don''t think the hikers ever had a direct view of this thing.

They at first thought it was a bear standing on its hind legs on the porch, but as they got closer they realized that it was in front of the cabin and on the ground.

They were not close enough to it to see any detailed features, only that it was a tall, black, and ran on its hind legs. My father looked for tracks, but because of the rocky nature of the ground he found only one relatively good track near the stream. He said the track was about 17 to 18\" long and the toes were distinct and humanlike. The great toe was about as large as the bare heel track of a man.

It was near sunset and the sun had already gone behind the mountains. There was a sparsly forested rise toward the southwest,above the beaver pond we were fishing. Just beyond this rise was the south slope of a ridge of old growth forest. A horrible gravelly scream or yell of almost unbelievable volume came from just inside the forest at about 150 to 200 yards distance. I am an avid bowhunter of 20 years experience with all manner of big game and the sound was definitely not an elk or bear. Elk make some loud and unusual sounds but this sound was vastly different and many times louder. I noticed that a light breeze was blowing from us toward the source of the sound. If the creature had a good sense of smell, it was probably smelling us. Bowhunting experience has taught me that an elk would smell us under the same conditions. The sound had a threatening essence to it. The sound itself was kind of undescribable and seemed louder than a creature could possibly make. Whatever made the two tone scream must have one big set of lungs and a very large, megaphone size, mouth. The sound lasted about 1 or 2 seconds and was repeated three times, with a 10 or 15 second pause between each blast of noise. I was unarmed and decided since I had my sons with me I would give the creature its space. We left. I was somewhat alarmed, but would have gone to the source of the sound if I had not had my sons with me. I did go to the area of the source of the sound the next morning alone at sunrise to see if I could find tracks or other evidence of the source of the sound. I some very old large tracks in soft dirt on a flat area about 1/2 mile uphill. They were about 16\" by 8\" in size but too old to descern any toes or other detail and could have been bear tracks distorted and enlarged by rains and time. There was a line of about 20 of these large tracks in single file across the bare ground of this bench. Most of the rest of the soil in this area is too rocky to see the tracks of soft footed animals well. The tracks I found were at least a week or two old. I spent all morning looking the area over, hoping to find evidence, but hoping I didn''t find the creature itself.

I had done most of the driving to get there and we arrived there well after midnight searching for a place to camp and fish.  My son does not enjoy crowds when camping so we looked for some place \"out of the way\" yet not too remote.  We drove up a forest service road near Ophir Creek looking for a campground we had seen a sign for.  As I recall it was probably three or four in the morning.  I know it was still dark outside.  We located the campground, but unfortunately it appeared to be operated not by the Forest Service but by a private individual who had very opposing views to the government and authority in general, as evidenced by a very descriptive sign at the entrance to the \"campground\".  My son and I continued on up the forest service road toward a place we later found to be Blue Lakes near Greenhorn Mountain.  As we were driving up this road which wound in an out of pine trees and open meadows we came to a long straight stretch of road.  As I approached this straight part of the road I notice a small \"pocket\" of trees illuminated by my headlights on the left side of the road.  The trees bordered the road there, but it was open meadow leading up to the pocket of trees.  In the center of the stand of trees I saw an orange light that I at first took to be a reflector on a pole or stick marking the road. As I got within twenty or thirty yards of the trees I seemed to notice movement and thought someone was walking in the trees and smoking a cigarette and I was seeing the \"cherry\" at the tip of the cigarette.  I still felt no cause for concern and remember thinking facetiously that it was one of the \"Ophir Creek Campground Wackos\" out for a four in the morning recon. I continued to drive up the road and watched the orange light fade as the lights no longer shined directly into the trees.  As we rolled by my son said \"Dad?\" in a questioning tone.  He had seen the orange light/reflection also and was pointing into the trees to the left.  I noticed a large rock in the periphery of my headlights and something standing behind the rock turning it''s head to follow the movement of my truck as we drove past the trees at the edge of the road.  It was probably ten to fifteen feet off the road.  I started to brake but something inside said don''t stop so I didn''t.  What I saw in those few moments was definitely humanoid or bipedal, whatever you want to call it.  It was standing perfectly erect, not slumped and was definitely watching my pickup and turning it''s head and upper body to keep my truck in sight.  The large rock hid the lower half of the body but I could see a vague outline of it''s torso (from about where the navel would be on a human being), shoulders, and head as I passed.  I do not recall seeing any distinct outline of arms in the very brief time this happened.  I would say the whole incident took 15 to thirty seconds to transpire.  I drove on up the road watching my mirror but saw nothing in the red glow of my taillights.  I looked over at my son whose only comment was, \"did we just see what I think we saw?\"  I told him \"yes, I think we did.\"  We drove on up to Blue Lakes and talked about what we had seen and then took a short nap (with the doors locked) waiting for daylight so we could set up camp.  Later that morning after daylight had come and we set up camp, we drove back down the road to the stand of trees and got out to look around.  The ground was covered in pine needles (except the road area and a creek bed about twenty of thirty yards away.)  We both stood by the large rock and realized the \"creature\" had to have been 7 to 7-1/2 feet tall because the top of the rock was at the level of our chests  (he and I are 5''10\" tall).  We found one spot in the edge of the road where it appeared something had come down off the hillside on the right side of the road.  There were no distinct tracks in the packed gravel of the road, but there were two spots where small rocks (maybe thumbnail size) had been disturbed and pushed from the roadside toward the hillside (90 degrees from the direction of normal vehicle travel).  I took several photos of the stand of trees, the large rock, the marks on the roadside and an indistinct depression in the moist edge of the creek.  There was nothing that specifically proved it was a Bigfoot standing in those trees watching us drive by, but my son and I have no doubt that it was.

We hunted the morning and I had seen nothing. <BR><BR>    About 9 or 10 am I had spotted a bear up higher so I figured we had better move to a new location, for the bear may have spooked any deer in the area. We walked down the trail to our truck and left the area. The time from seeing the bear until we left was about 20 minutes. The bear was heading north-east. We drove south-west down the mountain about 30 to 45 minutes. When we came around the corner of the road, it overlooked Wolf Park and a hill on the south side. <BR><BR>    My friend and I saw them at the same time. He slammed on the brakes and we bailed from the truck. We both started glassing 2 of the creatures standing in an opening. They turned and started looking at us. That amazed me because of the distance. It was quite a distance away. With the naked eye you could make out the size of the creatures, which - between that and the fact that they were standing up -  made us stop. We looked at them about 3 to 5 minutes and then 3 small ones walked out of the draw the parents had come from. They were about half the size of the parents. <BR><BR>     The creatures were jet black and you could see the arms and legs, torso and head. They started moving back to cover when a white pick-up came out on the road below us which was about 75 to 100 yards from where the largest one was. The truck came to an quick stop for 10 to 15 seconds,  and then took off like a bat out of hell. The creatures disappeared into the brush. <BR><BR>    We drove to the spot we had seen them and looked at where they had gone. The slope was pretty steep and real loose.

The brush was thick in this draw were they had gone so we did not go looking for them. We left and went home. <BR><BR>    We talked about it for a week or two.

I started to feel the hair stand up on the back of my neck and I was sure that I had found the spot where I would have an opportunity at a bull. I could see a fairly large clearing just past the brush with a large wallow in the middle. I set up behind a thicket with a clear shot into the clearing, knocked an arrow set down the bow and blew on the hyper hot cow call 3 times. Immediately I heard him coming in from about 100 yards away but not from the direction I expected. He was coming in from just to the left of where I had just walked through. I was surprised he wasnt catching my scent. I could here him coming in very quickly through some very thick timber just past the clearing. I had my bow ready and I could see shadows move as he approached but I couldnt make out an elk. He stopped in the timber just outside the clearing at 30 yards and then it got super quiet. I didnt want to move a muscle so I just sat there motionless for 5 minutes and then blew the cow call again, nothing but silence. I waited another 5 minutes and decided he had blown my cover and left silently. I noticed it was 7:15.<BR><BR> I got up and walked over to the wallow and I remember thinking that I had never seen an elk wallow look anything like this before. It looked like a tub made by man. It was perfectly rectangular, about 10 feet long and 4 feet wide and about a foot deep and appeared that the mud had been scooped out by hand. The water was perfectly clear so I knew nothing had used it recently. I admired it for a minute and then started hunting up through this hanging valley. I hunted all day up through the valley and to the top of the mountain without seeing any elk or much fresh sign. I started down the mountain thinking I really wanted to find that wallow again not so much to hunt today but to have a better sense of how to find it in the future.<BR> <BR>At about 4:00 I knew I was getting close but I was exhausted from battling the timber all day. Then I stumbled upon another wallow that was also very strange. This one was round and about 7-8 feet in diameter, quite deep with the mud walls scooped up like a mini volcano cone. I remember getting a very weird feeling while looking at this wallow. How could an elk roll in the mud and create this perfectly round hole in the ground? This one had been used very recently because the water was very muddy and there was fresh mud all over the surrounding brush and trees. I started waking down the hill towards the first wallow and realized I was on a heavily traveled game trail, I followed it down the hill about 300 yards and it dropped me into the clearing from the morning. I walked over to the first wallow once again admiring how handmade it looked. I took one step away from the wallow towards the direction that I had entered the area that morning and started to hear a knocking sound. At first I really didnt pay attention but then I realized that it wasnt timed with the breeze and not consistent. I stopped the sound stopped. I took a step and knock, knock. I took a couple more steps and knock, knock, and knock much louder. Ok now the hairs are standing up on my neck as I realize the knocking is directly timed with my movements. The sound is coming from inside the swampy thicket area about 60 yards from the edge of the clearing. I get to the edge and stop the sound stops. I take a step to the right and knock, knock. A few steps to the left and knock, knock ,knock very loud this time. So know I think there must be a bow hunter in a tree stand in there who is messing with me and Im starting to get mad. I decide to take off my backpack and sneak in there where the knocks are coming from as quietly as a seasoned bow hunter can. I notice that as soon as I enter the brush I no longer hear any knocking. I keep sneaking in and finally get to where the sound was coming from and nothing. I search the area high and low looking in every tree for a tree stand and nothing. Now Im really mad and go crashing out of there the way I came in. I get back to the clearing and swing my pack onto my back and knock, knock, knock, knock very hard coming from right where I was just standing a couple of minutes ago. Now Im totally freaked out. I grab my binoculars and start glassing through the brush and timber looking for a window that I could see through. I take a couple steps to my right while looking through the binoculars and I see a log swing through the air and hit a dead tree, Knock. I quickly try to focus on the spot when it comes into focus in a small sight window through the brush. I can see a large grayish black hairy figure, I see its torso, arm, shoulder, elbow and hand clutching a log about 4 in diameter and smacking it against a dead tree, knock, knock. I move to try and get a better look but it moves from the window but as it does I distinctly see its movement. It was a very human like move as it turned I could see it turn at the hips while its arm swung in time with the movement just like a person would look while walking and turning 90 degrees. Realize I am looking through binoculars at 60 yards so all of this is crystal clear. It was totally covered with hair about 3 to 4 inches long and appeared to be matted with mud. I judge that its elbow was at least 5 feet off the ground.<BR><BR> Almost going into complete panic now I start running the other way. I only take a few steps and force myself to calm down. I tell myself that if that animal wanted to harm me it would have already done it. So I start walking diagonally away from it in a direction that will get me off of this shelf. The knocking continues intermittently as I put yards between us, when I get about 150 yards away I hear what I can only describe as the sound of a log flying through the air crashing through the brush and hitting the ground with a thud at about 50 yards from me. I never heard any more sound but as I worked my way down through the dark timber I found myself on a heavy game trail and I came on a switch back where a tree had fallen or been pushed over. As I approached I could see and smell this rancid black liquid on the ground where the tree used to stand. I can only describe it as a huge puddle of pitch black diarrhea buzzing with flies. There did not appear to be anything in it like chokecherry seeds or hair or bone that you would associate with bear shit. I see lots of bear sign and this certainly didnt appear to be bear.<BR><BR>I got off of that slope as quickly as possible without further incident. It was an hour and a half back to camp. I arrived in camp disappointed to find that all 3 of my hunting partners had already left. It was a long semi sleepless night in the tent with my pistol by my side but uneventful.<BR><BR>(Edited only to add a few paragraph breaks for ease of reading.)", :environment "A flat shelf at the bottom of a hanging valley surrounded by thick steep forest.", :fixed_year "2009", :run_time "2022-05-20 16:16:45.000000"} {:nearestroad "I-70", :date "Nov. 5, 2001", :locationdetails "Sighting occurred off I-70 between Minturn and Edwards.", :submitted_date "2002-01-14", :sketch 0, :bfroid 3636, :otherwitnesses nil, :run_id 34, :nearesttown "Eagle", :styler_highlight_1797 0, :timeandconditions "Nov.-10 pm-break in snow-big moon out.", :month "0001-11-01", :county "Eagle County", :state "Colorado", :fixed_month "0001-11-01", :submitted "2002-01-14 00:00:00.000000", :title "Nighttime sighting of two furry bipeds in Eagle River during snowstorm", :otherstories nil, :year "2001", :season "Fall", :class "Class A", :alsonoticed nil, :url "http://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=3636&PrinterFriendly=True", :observed " I lived in Colorado for 29 years. Eighteen of those I spent working at ski resorts. Over the years I''ve seen hundreds of deer and elk as well as dozens of bear, everything from cubs to large 400 pound males. In the last 4 years I''ve had 3 separate sightings of 4 creatures that I hesitate to identify. <BR><BR>My third sighting occured in November 2001 between Vail and Eagle. I was driving west on I-70 with my girlfriend who was sound asleep next to me. It was around 10 p.m., a day or two after the full moon. It began to snow very hard, almost whiteout conditions at times. Somewhere after Vail and before Eagle the snow stopped for a few minutes. Even though it was night, it was very bright out due to the large moon and all the fresh snow. As I rounded a long curve in the highway my headlights hit two figures walking in the middle of the Colorado River. My first thought was, \"Oh no, these people have wrecked in the river and they''re trying to cross back to the highway.\" <BR><BR>I started to pull my Jeep to the side of the road and when I got even with them I saw two fuzzy looking people with very long arms walking down river. I could only see them from the knees up but it was obvious they were human in shape, upright, with elbows and knees. I stopped the car pretty quickly just past them and put on my emergency flashers. There was no break in the snowbank on the side of the road so obviously there was no wreck. With my girlfriend still asleep, I got out and stood on the edge of the bank looking up river for the two figures. It was maybe 20 degrees out and when they didn''t round the bend I figured I''d back the car up to them. As soon as I put my reverse lights on a semi-truck came around the corner and almost hit us, so I parked again and sat there for a couple of minutes. I had a camera with a flash. I figured I might get a picture since it was so bright out. But I couldn''t bring myself to wake my girlfriend up to tell her I was going to run back up the highway to take a picture of Mr. and Mrs. Bigfoot and I wasn''t about to leave her there sound asleep on the side of a snow covered highway. So when it began to snow again I put the car in gear and just drove home. <BR><BR>Of my three sightings I find the third one the most compelling. I suppose someone in costume could have fooled me on the first two sightings.

I also believe it was the same one both times although the encounters were 10 years apart. The first encounter was when I was in 2nd grade. I was born in 1963 so this was quite a few years ago. I was playing at a school playground in Kalamazoo Michigan. My mother, teachers and other students were also at the playground. The adults were setting up a picnic for the students. It was close to school ending for summer holiday. I wandered off in to a wooded area near the playground. It was a very peaceful and sunny day. I was picking up pine cones, etc. while moving through the woods. I was not paying attention to my surroundings and was looking down at the ground. I was stopped very abruptly when I physically ran into a Sasquatch. It was huge and towered over me holding a large limb from a pine tree open. He was using his right arm to hold the tree branch. I was not afraid because I did not know as a child that this was an unusual thing. I just thought it was natural to see such a thing in the woods. He stood on two legs. His face had expression. First expression was surprise/anger. His face calmed quickly to a gentle, almost observant glance. To see his face I had to turn my head straight up as if looking at the sky. His skin had a tawny reddish hue and his body and face/head was covered in a deep chocolate hair/fur. He stood looking at me for a long time. I did not move. I did not notice any odd odor. He was very quiet and his eyes were very gentle. I sensed he understood I was a child. He turned to his left, releasing the branch of the tree he was holding with his right hand. He walked away from me in long, strong strides. The branch he was holding swung loudly over head. It was a very tall tree and the lowest branch was several feet over my head. <BR><BR>My second encounter happened when I was 16 years old (1979?). I was at my family home sitting on the front porch waiting for a friend to pick me up to go out for the evening. It was winter time. There was snow on the ground. This encounter also took place in Kalamazoo, Michigan. I heard a low gutteral growl coming from the side of the house. My parents were not home and it was dark outside. Our house is completely surrounded by woods. I heard large heavy stepping, something with great weight was moving slowly along the house to where I was sitting. I sensed it was a large animal. I stood up and walked off the porch and headed down the driveway towards the neighbor''s home. I remember I started to sing softly to myself. The growling/knocking/walking noises stopped. Once I had made it down the driveway my friend pulled up in her car. I could see her looking at something on the side of our house. When I opened the car door I looked back at the house and saw a large figure peeking around the corner of the house. I recognized him as the same creature I had seen when I was a child. With that recognition I did not feel afraid. I felt almost relieved. The next day there were large footprints in the snow coming out of the woods along side my family''s house. The footprints traveled to the front of the house, around a dogwood tree and down the front yard. My parents had someone come in to analyze the prints. They were told the prints were not a hoax but made by something/someone very large with much weight. It was winter time and there was deep snow on the ground. The prints were very clear and the snow beneath the print was particularly icy as if heat from the foot itself had melted the snow. I never told my parents about these encounters until a couple of years ago when they finally informed me that they had seen the footprints in the snow back in 79'' and called someone to look at them.<BR><BR>I am a dancer and choreographer. I grew up not only dancing at the studio but also dancing in my parent''s living room that has large windows that look out to the woods in back of the house. I have often felt something was watching me from the woods. I never felt frightened of it though. Maybe because I believe humans are far more frightening that Sasquatch.

But it was the howling that gave me the creeps. Otherwise I would have passed it off as a cat tormenting a dog.<BR> <BR>I went back inside and said something about the incident to my co-worker, and we kind of laughed it off and finished up for the night. About 20-25 minutes later I was in the kitchen area when my co-worker screamed \"GET OUT HERE QUICK.\" So I headed to the front just in time to see a very large hairy looking thing just walking down the street right under a light as casual as could be.<BR><BR>We both kind of stared at each other for a few seconds and then I opened the front door to get a better look at this thing walking across the street. What happened next is still very vivid in my mind: My co-worker said \"do something\" so I yelled \"HEY!\" It never broke stride but it turned its head and looked right at me. Then it walked a few more feet and turned next to a fence and walked past a car wash and storage unit and out of sight.<BR><BR>One odd thing I noticed about this \"thing\" was it had long reddish brown hair from head to toe and it didn''t seem to have a neck. It was like its head was just sitting on top of the shoulders and it was very very large in size. It walked next to a chain link fence aproximately 6-7 feet in height topped by  three strands of barbed wire and this thing''s shoulders were even with the top of this fence. <BR><BR>I personally didn''t see exactly where this thing came from but I suspect that it came out of the Sand Creek ditch which runs right through the middle of town. It''s a large ditch that allows water runoff from the mountains a few miles away.<BR><BR>Several minutes later the guy who delivered our paper drove up. I had noticed him coming from the exact area where we had lost sight of this thing, so I asked him if he had seen anything back there. He said no but he heard something in an old abandoned building he used to store his extra papers and it scared the hell out of him so he left rather quickly. <BR><BR>Just a few minutes later a police officer pulled in on the parking lot. Still feeling shocked and a little scared about what we''d seen I asked him to drive his cruiser back in the area past the storage units and see if he noticed anything out of the ordinary. We watched him drive back shining his spotlight back and forth and as he turned past the storage units we lost sight of him. Several minutes later he returned quite shaken and started asking me what I''d seen. I was rather evasive about my answers (he asked me several times what I had seenbut I never did say.)

Two of my goats are experienced packers and two were new.  After several shorter treks I had gone to Spring Creek Pass where I planned to walk part of the Colorado Trail -- possibly down to Durango -- then resupply and go back to the Wemineuch.  After reaching one of the local creeks one of my goats started getting sick so I decided to head back toward the truck and bide my time while I assessed his situation.  There were tons of people on the trail last summmer and I wanted to be alone so I went off near Jarosa Mesa and found a meadow surrounded by thick forest where I didn''t feel I''d encounter anyone.  We stayed two days.<BR><BR>During that time the dogs and particularly the goats were periodically nervous, then they would calm. Goats point to what they see or hear but whenever I would look I would not see anything. I checked the area thinking there might be bear or mountain lion nearby but didn''t find signs that would indicate a den and although there was bear scat in the area it was not fresh.  Still, this was a time of drought that had the bears hungry all over the state and they were having bear problems down in Lake City right then so, especially with a sick goat, I stayed alert to the possibility.  Especially since I was also near one of the only water sources.<BR><BR>In the meantime I was doctoring my goat and working with the others. At one point when I was playing tug-of-war and growling with my dogs (an older border collie and a border collie pup) the goats alarmed and bunched around us pointing at the woods but when I checked I couldn''t see anything and the dogs didn''t react.  I periodically got the feeling we were being watched, then it would pass. The puppy occasionally got interested in something in the woods but would come back. When I work with the goats, I sing a lot.  They have also developed a fondness for the pennywhistle so I had spent a lot of time in the afternoon just playing music with all of us sprawled around the meadow together.<BR><BR>The meadow was rich in smells but aside from the plant smells from walking around there was more a musky elk smell than anything.  Lots of signs of deer and elk in the area.<BR> <BR>At dusk the animals got extremely nervous. I had just gone inside my tent to get something, both dogs were inside with me and the goats just outside.  I suddenly heard this alarm vocalization unlike anything I''ve ever heard from my animals, but easily could have been.  Under the circumstances I could easily have made vocalizations I had never made before. The goats were beside the tent and whatever it was was right behind the tent. I knew it was something big because my dog will tear after a lesser beast barking but the only times I''ve encountered a bear or a mountain lion with him he stays right with me and gives a quiet growl that says, \"This is serious.\"   I grabbed my pepper spray fearing it was a bear and started out of the tent, turning as I crouched out the door and yelling (don''t ask me why) at the dogs to stay inside. <BR><BR>The goats were beside the tent pointed at the back.  There it was. A bigfoot. I couldn''t see its whole body because it was blocked by the tent but if it was a female the breasts weren''t prominent.  It had medium chestnut fur, was standing erect on two legs, probably 8 feet tall (I have a brother who is 6''7\" and a nephew who is 6''10\" and growing so I have some perspective), and probably only 12 feet away staring straight at me.  The face had fur -- less around the eyes but not as bare as your sketch -- and the eyes were all brown -- no whites. Like a deer''s eyes.  Its arms were hanging at its sides. Everything was totally silent.<BR><BR>My dogs were beside me but we were all frozen in place.  I know that if anything threatened me one of my dogs would die defending me.  On an instinctive level I was as terrified as I''ve ever been but even at the time I knew I didn''t feel threatened.  I wouldn''t have dreamed of using the pepper unless it had attacked.  In retrospect I thought it was interesting that I didn''t have (at least under those circumstances) fight/flight instincts. I simply froze in place.  Perhaps if it had done anything menacing I would have reacted differently.  But I felt simultaneously terrified (instinctively) and amazed.  Before that moment I had never even known if I believed in bigfoot or not.  Had I thought about it I would have assumed it would be something to ponder in the Pacific Northwest, but certainly not in Colorado.  Had never once, for all the thought I''ve put into \"what would happen if I encountered...\" thought of the possibility of encountering one and was totally unprepared for and in awe of it.<BR><BR>It seemed unhurried.  We stared at each other for what felt like a long time, then it made a low rumbling sound and turned its head and I caught just a glimpse of another back behind it.  It looked back at me, then they turned and loped off out of sight.  I could feel the vibrations in the ground.<BR><BR>I got the feeling that nothing in the encounter was threatening to me or the goats.  That they were curious.<BR><BR>There was a slight breeze and I was upwind (somehow I doubt that was accidental) so I didn''t notice a particularly strong smell.  I think I had felt the vibration as it/they approached but thought it was the goats.  During the entire encounter from the vocalization on, except for the breeze, it was totally silent and the sound (birds etc) resumed a few minutes later.<BR><BR>We all slept very peacefully that night.<BR><BR>I found no tracks but the ground was so dry and hard I couldn''t make a very good track when I tried.<BR><BR>The next morning I packed up and left more because I felt like I was intruding in someone else''s space than feeling danger.  I felt like I was being watched and gauged from the animals that they did too.<BR><BR>My older dog stayed right beside me, alert and ready to act.  The puppy seemed unphased by it all.

The area we were in was a few miles north of Colorado Highway 14 and a few miles west of Cameron pass. It was a parcel of Colorado state forest service land that had just recently been opened to hunting. It was aprox. 8:00am and we were moving north through the trees on the east side of a fairly large clear cut. It had just snowed that morning, so our movements were fairly quiet. I was using a diaphram call trying to imitate a cow elk in estrus (a series of higher pitched squeals and mews). As we were moving along I was warching off to our west to see if I could spot any movement in the aspen on the uphill slope on the west side of the clear cut. It was then that I saw movement, a large figure stood up from a short bit of growth. At first I thought that it might be another hunter, but as I looked closer I could see no weapon that it could be hunting with and the size seemed to be to large for a person. I stopped movnig at that point and watched it, it stood and looked in our direction for about 30 seconds and then turned and started walking up into the dense stand of aspen on the hillside. The thing that really sticks in my mind is the way that it swung its whole upper body as it turned to leave, it is almost like it used the momentum from the turning of its upper body to make its whole body turn to leave. At that point I mentioned it to my partner and all he said was that it was probably another hunter, I might mention that he is the type of person that does not believe that anyting out of the ordinary might actually exist. It was only after I mentioned it to him that I raised the binoculars that were hanging around my neck and scanned the hillside for anymore signs of movement. I scanned the hillside for about five minutes and was unable to pick up any movement. We never checked the far side of the meadow where I first saw it because my partner was worried that if we broke out of the trees that we might spook any game that might be in the area. Also because he believed that it was another hunter he did not wish to investigate the area that I had seen it. All I know is that what ever I saw was not a person and was not a bear (I have seen those go up on two legs before), I only know that I am not sure what it was I saw. It was a year or two later and my wife and I were looking at a bigfoot page on the net and found recordings of what is believed to be a bigfoot. When we heard it she mentioned that the sound I make on the call when hunting sounds very similar to the sound that was recorded. I don''t if this could have contributed to seeing what I saw or not, maybe it was trying to figure out what we were.

It was late June and I was on a fishing trip to several lakes and beaver ponds in the area.  I was supposed to be taking a friend along, but he had to cancel at the last minute.<BR><BR>  I left my camp at Dumont Lake in the morning and headed up the four wheel drive road to the trailhead that leads to Fish Hook Lake and Lost Lake. It is usually possible to drive the three miles to the trailhead, but the road was closed by the Forest Service due to lingering snow drifts, so I had to hike the road. I arrived at Fishook Lake in the late morning and spent a couple of hours fishing and eating lunch.  About 1:30 I left that lake and began to hike to Lost Lake which is only a few hundred yards to the northeast.<BR><BR>  The trail I was on kind of funnels into the lake, and as the lake came into view I noticed a large, dark  animal about 20 yards to my right near a boulder.  My first thought was that I had suprised a bear, so I froze and waited to see what the animal would do.  It was soon obvious that this animal was not a bear or any other animal I had ever seen.  The animal was standing on two legs and was slightly crouched, it appeared to be staring across the lake.  When it saw me, it fully crouched next to the boulder with its left hand resting on the rock. <BR><BR> What I saw is best described as a large, hairy bipedal animal that had features of both a man and an ape.  <BR><BR>  The animal was covered with shiny, dark hair that was approximately 3-4\" long and was somewhat shorter in the face area.  The animal was huge and the arms appeared very long as opposed to a person''s.  The head was somewhat dome-shaped and was set on massive shoulders, the neck appeared very short.  The animal''s eyes appeared below a slightly sloping forehead and there may have been a brow ridge.  The eyes were dark and the nose was flat and wide.  The face was dark and the lips appeared thin. I never saw the animal open its mouth or display teeth. <BR><BR>  After the animal crouched, it again looked over the lake then back at me.  The animal then stood up and to my relief pivoted away from me and began to walk away from me at an angle.  I moved forward to get a better look and the animal must have heard me move because it began to move quicker and glanced back at me.  The animal walked briskly into the trees and I heard it moving for a couple more seconds then it was out of earshot.  The whole event lasted between 8 and 12 seconds.<BR><BR>  I realized at this time that this must be the bigfoot of legend, but I had thought that they lived in the Pacific Northwest and were probably a myth, I certainly had never heard any reports of sightings in Colorado.  I briefly thought about following the animal or looking for some good footprints to show the appropriate authorities, but I was alone and the animal was big, I would conservatively guess it was around 7 feet tall and weighed over 300 pounds, so I left and hiked quickly out of the area, not slowing down until I got to my truck.<BR><BR>  After getting back to camp, I debated about what to do and finally decided the potential ridicule if I reported this to someone and the animal was not found was not worth it.

I stopped in Buena Vista to fuel up and get a coffee.  As I came thru the little town of Twin Lakes, I was just feeling tired and the more I drove, the sleepier I got.  So before I started up Independence Pass, I thought I would pull over and get some fresh air.  (I had just noted that it was 36 degrees on the truck temp. gauge and even took a picture of it on my phone, to send to my brother in Virginia).  I pulled over to the left side of the road.  As I got out of the truck, I noticed movement in the meadow directly in front of me.  Not more than 3-4 miles below here, I had just seen a buck deer so I was thinking that I had probably flushed another deer.  As I walked to the rear of my truck, I continued to look out in the meadow and that is when I saw this thing move.

The \"arms\" hung to the sides just like a person.  Only if this was a person, he was really tall.  It was furry and a deep brown/red in color. I was so frightened that I thought I would throw up.  As I moved back toward my truck door, it tipped its head back as if it was smelling the air.  When I opened the truck door, it turned, bent over and picked something up and began to run on two legs across the meadow away from me. Not running like sprinting, but running at a pace that he could probably continue for hours. Honestly, the thing that struck me most about this was the way it picked up, whatever it was, and carried it with both hands clasped together in front of its torso.

It was getting late in the day, there was about a half hour to 45 minutes of daylight left, when I heard what sounded like a stone or something hitting a fallen over shed that was to my left & behind me about 10 to 15 feet away. That caught my attention right away because I had thought just before that something or somebody may be messing with me because as I would turn to my left to reach down to pump more pressure in the pump sprayer I noticed a small stone about the size of a nickel slowly come to rest a couple of feet from my pump sprayer. I took a long steady look around me & saw nothing that stood out, but I was on a mission - I wanted to get the cabin bleached so I could leave for home. I then started the generator to get the water pressure up so I can rinse off the bleach.  I grabbed the hose & started rinsing.  The hair on the back of my neck stood up. I would often turn & look real quick behind me and then I seen the ferns parting, coming in my direction but not directly at me & a stone came to rest. I thought maybe my son might be messing with me because I have told him about a lot of strange things that have happened up here. So I yelled for him to knock it off. Then it happened again, another stone & another.  I went around to the front of the cabin to shut off the generator which is on the front porch.  I noticed my son was sitting in my truck about 30 feet away from the opposite side of the cabin where I was rinsing the bleach off, messing with his i-phone with the window up. I shut off the generator & was walking towards the truck as a stone hit & rolled off the front porch. I rushed to the truck to get him to get in the cabin. He thought I was joking at first. Then he seen I was serious then he experienced it himself. We got in the cabin, it was last light, I could still see out the windows and stones were still being tossed & now they were hitting the cabin but not hitting the windows. As I sat at the dinning room table I seen something large & dark move fast from the other side of my driveway to behind my truck. I grabbed my 44 mag,  reached in my pocket and sounded the truck alarm to scare it off.   By then it was real dark out so I closed the drapes. My son went to his bedroom and his bedroom wall was hit. The cabin was at times being hit by stones on at least 3 sides within seconds of each other. There had to be at least 3 throwing stones. My son was terrified. I immediately called Kim Fleming, she was there earlier just after my family left for home. My son counted at least 19 stones hitting the cabin, it is not uncommon to have my walls or door hit very hard & I mean whopped hard after dark, it will shake the log cabin & it scares the HELL out of anyone there.

While living there I was involved in several related situations. <BR><BR>One of my foster sons was employed for a time with the U.S. Forest Service working in the sign maintainence shop.  They had quite a rash of Forest Service signs being ripped down.  If you are familiar with the signs they use they are constructed of massive timbers and quite sturdy.  Some of the signs were over 8 foot off the ground to the top yet they had been torn down with apparent ease.  At first they suspected local teenagers or possibly bears as being responsible.  To make it more difficult for the vandals the Forest Service put a thick layer of grease along the tops of some of the signs.  Within days, one of the signs was again vandalized.  The grease on the top of the damaged sign show a huge human like handprint. <BR><BR>A few weeks later we decided to go on a late night cruise in the area where the damage had taken place - just a mile or two below Turquoise Lake west of Leadville.  The dirt road we followed had a steep drop off to a stream on the left.  To the right was a large open sagebrush meadow with thick timber behind.  A large boulder, at least 15 feet tall, was in the middle of the meadow.  We had stopped on the road above the stream and were visiting when we heard something \"sloshing\" in the water below our vehicle.  When we trained a spotlight on the area, the sloshing stopped, only to start again when the light was turned off.  A few minutes later we spotted a large figure run across the road about 100 yards in front of our headlights.  We <BR>also heard heavy footsteps crushing the sagebrush.  We immediately drove to the spot where we had seen the creature and checked for footprints.  Non were found but a trail of mashed sagebrush lead towards the treeline.  We swung the spotlight around the area just in time to catch a glimpse of a dark primate, about 7 - 8 feet tall, cross in front of the aforementioned boulder and disappear into the dense forest behind the meadow. <BR><BR>I don&#8217;t remember any particulars but believe the incidents occurred during the summer of 1975 (probably July or August) and time was sometime around 10 pm. <BR><BR>", :environment nil, :fixed_year "1975", :run_time "2022-05-20 16:16:59.000000"} {:nearestroad "Crystal lakes Co. all dirt roads", :date "22nd", :locationdetails "8 miles from Red Feather Lakes, Colorado.", :submitted_date "2009-09-30", :sketch 0, :bfroid 26671, :otherwitnesses "It was me and my brother and were were having a cup of coffee", :run_id 34, :nearesttown "Red Feather Lakes,Colorado", :styler_highlight_1797 0, :timeandconditions "7:30 AM was a light snow when we seen it or him, later it started to snow pretty hard.", :month "0001-09-01", :county "Larimer County", :state "Colorado", :fixed_month "0001-09-01", :submitted "2009-09-30 00:00:00.000000", :title "Two brothers witness an upright creature while at a cabin near Red Feather", :otherstories "No , it was jut the second time I had been there,We were there to trout fish for the week.", :year "2009", :season "Fall", :class "Class A", :alsonoticed "Nothing ,but a light snow fall", :url "http://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=26671&PrinterFriendly=True", :observed " My name is John, I visited my brother Howard in Boulder Co.Sept. 19 thru Sept 26 He has a cabin at Crystal Lakes , Co. near Red Feather Co.

These prints were at least half again as big as a big human foot and the stride length was much longer than any human -- at least 4 feet or longer. They looked exactly like human prints. They were not bear, I recognize those. They proceeded across several small remaining snow patches on a mountain side meadow. There were about a dozen or more clear prints. I saw none on the ground between the snow, the ground was firm and damp. I saw no other suggestive evidence, but was not searching for any. I was scared shitless and wanted to get out of there ASAP! I wondered if they may have been human, and had enlarged and spread out by the heating, melting, cooling and refreezing that occurs at that time of year in the little snow patches. But the detail was fairly preserved and one would think that any melting and refreezing would blur those details. The possibility of this phenomenon should be examined. Someone should walk through the summer snow patches barefooted and then observe the prints for a number of days during the summer when this melt/refreeze procees occurs. If the enlarging of the prints and spreading of the stride does not occur, I assume these prints I saw were not human. If they do spread out, maybe someone just walked through there barefooted. I wondered if it were a hoax, but the area was quite remote and the perpetrator would have to know someone would pass that exact spot. I don''t recall if we were on an established trail or just wandering near our campsite. Also if it was a hoax, why would they put the prints in the snow, since one could not predict exactly when it would melt in the unpredictable summer weather. I have no particular interest in the existence of the Sasquatch, but as a scientist I am curious. Having seen these prints with my own eyes, I definitely believe it is possible.

Sometimes before bed we would go out and watch the bats dive bomb small rocks we tossed up into the air under the light above the back door. <BR><BR>Another game we played at night up there is called \"Mission Impossible.\" The idea is that a camp counselor goes into the surrounding woods whitch are cordoned off and hides as best he can. Everyone else (kids and group leaders) goes to find this person so he can give you a slip that says you found him. If you are one of the first five back you get ice cream or cake, some prize of that sort. Meanwhile the other counselors are out with flashlights patrolling around looking for you. If you are spotted you have to go back to the cafeteria and start over. <BR><BR>While I was out looking for the counselor I was hidden in the bushes next to the road leading to the cafeteria.

As I was crouched into the thick of the bushes I was motionless listening for anything that would tip me off to the whereabouts of anyone else. Thats when it struck me I couldent hear any of the regular sounds from the woods. No chirps, no animal rustling, none of the natural sounds I was used to hearing out there night after night. <BR><BR>As I started looking around I heard a light shaking of bushes adjacent to me in the baseball sidelines.

Myself, I am 6''4\" and leveled off this thing as it came out next to the fence whitch was 4 ft high.

I was dumbfounded and shocked, but not scared as it didnt seem to know where I was or that I was even there. It stepped out cautiously and took a few steps into the open to cross toward the outfield. About two steps into the field it crouched down and looked toward the road as a couple kids who got caught came around the bend and walked by me with thier backs to the baseball field. Then as they got farther away I looked back and it was on two feet and was moving in a flash. It was across the field in about 5-6 second and into the woods alongside the mountain. <BR><BR>When it ran I could see its whipsy hair in the moonlight, but I couldent make out a color.

 when it happened, we both simultaneously looked at each other said \"what the hell was that?\" and then said \"we better not tell anyone or they''ll think were crazy!\"  I can''t swear to what it was, but I''ll swear it wasn''t a bear.  this thing was the wrong color to be any kind of cat and it was to thin through the torso as compared to its overall size to be a bear and i suspect bears would have already been in hybernation.  the hair looked like it could have been 18 inches long, very shagy.  its body shape was like a giant human, not a cat or bear.  unfortunately the animal never

above lake huntington. in the sierras. myself, my fishing pardner, and another gentleman, were all fishing a small part of the river there, it was the last weekend of the season, before they close the roads, due to snow. about 3 miles down the river, my pardner decided he had enough, and stop to nap. this other gentleman and myself pushed on, maybe 3/4 of mile from where we had left my friend. i stop to fish a pool. the other guy  dropped down to the next pool, to fish it, that is how we were working the differant areas. 1 guy would stop to fish a hole and the other would go right down below. as i was fishing my little stretch, i noticed the guy coming back up, he looked very excited and was waving for me to come there, i figured that he landed a good fish, or had seen a bear. he was almost in a frenzy, he just told me to hurry when i caught up to him he was looking over the edge of the next little drop off, i looked over and saw nothing unusual, he said it was right there, and jumped his way down to the spot, i followed, asking him what he had seen. before i could even get the words out of my mouth this smell, i cant explain to you what it was, wet, moldy, well animal, musk filled the air, nothing i have smelled ever was like this. my friend then told me that he had seen it, again before i could even ask above us i saw it, there standing no more then i would say 25 yards up the hill, was a the creature i believe to be a bigfoot. about 8 foot tall, covered in a reddish brown, and some what black hair, the face i remember it looking almost humanoid in appearance. it then turned and began taking huge strides up the mountain, not running, but covering some serious ground.on 2 feet. not 4. i tried to follow it, but again i felt an almost hynotic sensation over take me, and my pardner later told me he felt the same way, and  i couldnt move, we watched it go right up to the top and over it. i felt very over whelmed, and did not say anything to my friend, we just walk in a silence back to our other friend, he could tell we were shooken up. but never let him in on what had just occured. to this day, when ever i think about it, i get overwelmed with emotion. when i got home i called the gentleman and talked to him about what we had seen, the feelings we went through were basically the same, when he saw the creature he said he could smell the smell i described, but not nearly as bad as when we came down to where it had been standing. then a strange feeling over took him as well, almost like we were hypnotized, or drugged. he has trouble now remembering what he looked liked, he can remember seeing it and the smell, but all other memeories are fading. i can tell you , i will never forget what he looked like, and have came to my own conclusions, i believe the smell the bigfoot emits can be used as sort of a defense system, let me explain, i believe when excited or scared the aroma he emits can actually work on a persons system, maybe for one, it makes you feel drugged, or for another it makes you feel hypnotized or just plain scared. the reason i feel this way, is like i said to this day, when i think about it, i am over

Actually in Fresno. The area is mostly farm land and some sparse woods and vineyards. nothing like foresty though. My self, my cousin and a friend had decided to go late night fishing at a little area on the river where the river sort of pools. Their is a bridge there. It was late and we were sitting there and fishing when we heard something making noise and looked back and saw a coyote running across the bridge heading north. The coyote kept looking back as it ran as if it was frightened.The coyote looked at us but it was clearly focused on something behind it and it was scared. We thought at that time that that was odd. We then heard what we thought was a splash as if someone had dove into the water behind us. It was dark so we just glanced back but of course saw nothing. We probably sat for about 10 minutes or so when suddenly there was a huge goosh and splash about 25 yards away in front of us. We stopped fishing and then tried looking into the darkness.This small boulder throwing continued at least 2 more times before we actually saw a dark figure about 40 yards away standing what looked about waist high in the river. Their was a full moon so it wasn''t to dark to see that it was a pretty big creature. By this time we were starting to get scared and were pretty much froze in place and had began to yell at it, thinking that it could be a person. This prompted my friend to yell threats of violence as young people are sometime prone to do, this creature basically turned it''s whole body to the right of it and grapped another boulder and with both hands over its head it threw it at us, this one landed about 15 yards away. It made no sound or noise only threw small boulders. It threw about 2 more boulders the last landing about 5 yards from us enough to splash water on our faces. By this time we had reeled in our lines and were trying to get out of there as fast as we could. We ran all the way back to the car which was through some trees across a field and up a hill. We went back the next day to the area and on rafts floated to the area where the creature had stood. My friend is about 6 foot tall and jumped in the water to see about how deep it was. The water came to his shoulders. Their was no way this was a man. We even saw some of the boulders that had been thrown at the bottom of the water as it wasn''t more then 5 1/2 feet deep.

My brother and I looked at each other, and unable to readily discern what we were hearing we continued to fish.  I did say to him, if I hear that again I am out of here.

I was backpacking with two other people in California''s Sierra Nevada mountains, near the northern boundary of Kings Canyon National Park. About a year later I wrote down a very detailed description of the event. I have always wanted to report this to some appropriate organization, so now that I have found the BFRO site, here it is.<BR><BR>I was 16 at the time of the event. I am now 37. The following is a refined version of a description I wrote one year after the event.<BR><BR>I was on a backpacking trip with two family friends who were about my parent''s age. Our destination was the Devil''s Punchbowl in California''s Sierra Nevada mountains which is about a 19-mile hike on good trails from the parking lot at Courtright Reservoir. [You can find a topo map of the area at http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?z=11&n=4112372&e=335727&s=50&size=m] The first night we camped at a place called Long Meadow. The second day was a long hike to Fleming Lake (elevation about 9600 feet,) where we made camp just before sunset. Our camp was at the northeast corner of the lake, about 50 yards from the shore, up against a low, steep granite slope. We were the only people camped at that lake that evening. The two adults set about making dinner, and I went fishing at the lake since the fish were jumping vigorously. I started at the point on the lakeshore that was closest to the campsite and worked my way around the north edge of the lake towards the west. It was starting to get dark, the wind was virtually calm, and it was so quiet and peaceful that I could clearly hear occasional sounds from camp about 100 yards away: talking and the clinking of cookware. I was really focused on the fishing since I was very eager to catch something before it got too dark.<BR><BR>I was changing a lure when I heard the sound. It was a distant wailing coming from the north/northeast, up a broad open valley, to my left. Fleming Creek runs through this valley. This call is very hard to describe, but one could describe it as human- or primate-like in its smooth, round character. The call was broken up into segments that rose and fell in pitch. Each segment lasted about 1.5 seconds and each followed immediately after the one before it, like \"oooOOo, oooOOo, oooOOo\" with the pitch and volume rising in the middle of each segment and trailing off abruptly at the end. There were about six segments in the call, making the total call length about 10 seconds. The sound was somewhere between an \"oooo\" and a \"wow\" sound.<BR><BR>I froze immediately upon hearing this. It did not really scare me, but it commanded all of my attention. I heard it very clearly though it was faint and obviously far away. I would guess its origin could have been anywhere from one to two miles away, up the valley to the north/northeast. As I said it was very calm that evening and sound carries far in conditions like that. The call stopped after the first six \"oooOOo\" segments, and I immediately and very consciously decided that I was hearing things and ignored it and went back to working on my lure. Then I heard it again and there was no ignoring it. There was a total of five or six very clear, distinct calls made up of about five or six \"oooOOo\" segments each. The entire event lasted maybe 45 seconds or a minute.<BR><BR>Once the second call started I stopped what I was doing and listened very carefully as the call repeated. I was definitely not hearing things. It was not the wind, since the breeze was barely a whisper. I was in an open meadow with a lake immediately in front of me and a tree-covered granite mountain behind me. The sound was not echoing, as there was nothing for it to echo against, and the sound did not trail off as it repeated as an echo does. It started and stopped very deliberately.<BR><BR>This spooked me and I packed up all my fishing gear and went back to camp. I told the others that I had heard an animal call of some kind and asked them if they had heard anything but they had not. My guess is that the sound was masked by the noises from their own activities and the steep but low granite slope behind them. I forced myself not to think about it much, since we still had four nights to spend out there and we were headed deeper into the mountains. I did not hear, see, feel, or smell anything unusual for the rest of the trip, though I was pretty keyed up and attentive after that.<BR><BR>Regarding the quality of the sound:<BR><BR>About a month after I got back from the trip I read in John Green''s book \"On the Track of the Sasquatch\" the description of the Puyallup recordings from 1973. It describes very well the quality of the call I heard: The unidentified noise is not an \"eeeee\" scream, but more of a long \"whooOooOooOoo\" or \"whoopwhoopwhoop\" at a high pitch and with immense volume. Heard from a distance it can be compared with the sound of a siren far off but it definitely is not that. When I first read that I got chills all over and I felt a little shocked, since that is an extremely good way to describe what I heard.<BR><BR>I recently found your website and listened to all the supposed Sasquatch sound recordings, and the sound I heard could easily have been made by the same source. But the sounds on your website are mostly long wails or howls, and what I heard undulated up and down fairly rapidly. The voice itself sounded like a cross between the 1973 Puyallup sounds and the 1993 Del Norte County \"angry Bigfoot\" scream. But what I heard did not sound in the least threatening. In retrospect, it seemed as if the caller were simply announcing to everyone that it was present. Though there were multiple calls, they all seemed to come from the same source, from the same direction. I did not hear anything that sounded like an answer.<BR><BR>To my mind there is no way this could have been a person unless they were playing with an amplifier. The noise was obviously far away and I find it hard to believe anyone (short of an opera singer) could project a call like that over such a distance. There were not that many people out there anyway.

I didn''t sleep well that night.  I had a feeling I was being watched and was uneasy. Breaking camp the next morning, Van went for water coming from an artesian spring in the wall of the canyon.  He found one very clear bigfoot footprint in the wet sand below the spring, about 80 feet from where we''d camped.  He called to me to come over and see.  My first reaction was this was a hoax.  Van and I examined the footprint in detail.  It was about 17 inches in length, with 5 clear toes and pressed down about 2 1/2 inches in the sand.  There was a musty smell in the area but this wasn''t overpowering.  Van concluded the print was real based upon the fact it had rained hard the previous morning and you could see the pattern of the rain drops on the surface of the sand except where the footprint was.  Also whatever had the print may very well be slightly above us at the end of the bluff in some rock outcroppings.  He suggested we get out of there while the getting was good.

I was dreaming I was trying to sleep but there was noise outside so in my dream I got out of bed and went to my window and pulled back the curtain.  I started tapping on the window to let whoever was outside know they were being noisy and disrupting my effort to try to sleep.   After my third tap on the window, I woke up from my dream and realized I had to go to the bathroom.  I got up and made my way to the toilet.  My bedroom window was open and my bathroom window was open.  Just before I flushed, I heard a faint noise, and I started to think it was a motorcycle coming around the bend on the highway, and in that second I thought to myself Who would be riding a motorcycle this early in the morning?. Then, the noise got louder and drawn out, and had a deep vibrating howl, and then it stopped.  I realized then that it was something I have never heard before and it was not human.  It sounded like it was on one of the mountains behind my house.  <BR><BR>Afterwards, I noticed there were no dogs barking, not even my dogs, and there werent even any crickets.  It was dead silence outside.  I was telling myself, oh my god, did I just hear what I think I heard?  I headed back to bed and noticed the clock said 3:33am. I asked my husband if he was awake. He had been snoring when I was in the bathroom.  I told him I had just heard something.  I explained the sound to him and I said I think it was a Bigfoot.  I could not believe what I had heard.  I could not sleep for over an hour, and we laid in bed waiting for more howling but there was none.  <BR><BR>The next day when I told everyone in the house, nobody had heard it.  Later Sunday morning, I used my cell phone to google different animal sounds to try to find the same howl I heard.  I tried Mountain lion, Wolf, Fisher, Fox, and none of them are in the least bit similar.  Then, I googled Bigfoot howls.  Oh my god! The 1994 Ohio Moaning Howl is almost exactly what I heard.  I got chills when I listened to it.  I played the recording to my household, and my oldest adult son recognized the sound also.  He as well as a few of his friends have had a few experiences too, including a rock being thrown at him. He has the rock in his bedroom.  I phoned my other family members and told them what I experienced and my mom told me that there was a post on facebook about a week earlier from someone that lives a few blocks away from me.  She was returning home late at night near the local dump (between Hoopa and Willow Creek, California).  Apparently, she thought she saw something near the highway and so did the car behind her as the other car turned around and drove back.   This location is only a couple of mountains away from where my home is located.  I figure the Bigfoot traveled to Hoopa from the dump site.   <BR><BR>I have lived in this area (Weitchpec and Hoopa, CA) almost my entire life and I have never, ever heard such a howl.

The reason why it got me a little jumpy was because of the fact that I had to have come within a couple of feet of this thing.  Now I''m a pretty big guy 6'' and about 220 Lbs., but what ever walked in front of my truck had to have been over 7 feet tall, due to the height of the truck (Chevy Z71). <BR><BR>Now when it comes to the poundage of this thing I would have to say it was well over 350 lbs.  As far as physical features all I saw was the back and arm swing. The thing never turned around for me to get a better look at it.  But it had a large back and rather long arms.  As far as the neck goes it didnt really have one.  The animals traps made it look like it didnt have a neck.  Kind of like me.  <BR><BR>But after I did find a place to turn around, I went back to look around, dumb I know, to say the least.  I only found a couple of tracks. They had to have been 14 to 15 inches long, plus the stride of this thing was a lot longer then mine. Just to make the stride this thing did, I had to make one heck of an effort.  Now all I can say is what ever I saw that day was nothing like anything I had ever seen in the woods, and I grew up in the outdoors.<BR>", :environment "The area was pretty thick with redwoods and undergrowth and the river was to my right.", :fixed_year "2003", :run_time "2022-05-20 16:14:27.000000"} {:nearestroad "Highway 101", :date nil, :locationdetails "Going north on 101, take 254, and once you turn onto 254, off to the left, I pulled in and parked.", :submitted_date "2003-12-06", :sketch 0, :bfroid 7504, :otherwitnesses "just one", :run_id 34, :nearesttown "Myers Flat", :timeandconditions "It was early afternoon, and the light conditions where poor due to the rain.", :month "0001-05-01", :county "Humboldt County", :state "California", :fixed_month "0001-05-01", :submitted "2003-12-06 00:00:00.000000", :title "Fisherman has a second encounter on a rainy afternoon, as a upright animal moves from a streambed.", :otherstories "No", :year "2003", :season "Spring", :class "Class A", :alsonoticed "The only thing that i found unusual was when the creature was spooked.

I had been coming to this area for the past couple of months and started to learn it a little better.  So I decided to go exploring for some fishing holes.  All I had with me at the time was a fishing rod and a GPS receiver so I wouldnt get lost. <BR><BR> I parked the truck and started out on foot. I had talked to two local fishermen about what was in these rivers, and what to use. Im from the south and this area was like a new world.  So I made my way down to the river along the side of the bank.  At times the going got a little hard but I managed.  I tried several places but the water was moving too fast, so I thought that I would try and find a slack part of the river, where the flow was a little slower.  Now these woods are a lot different than the ones I was used to, so I was a little excited about this new area.<BR><BR> I had been walking for maybe 45 minutes and covered maybe two miles when I saw something in the distance.  At first I thought that it was just a stump, seeing that I had left my glasses in the truck.  Now my vision isnt that bad, but I still need them for driving.  But, I started feeling a little uneasy due to an earlier encounter, plus it might have been a bear. <BR><BR>But, being the idiot that I am, I had to get closer.  I got to within about 75 yards, because I was using the tree line as cover. That was as close as I wanted to get.  You could say that my heart was beating out of my chest it was like I had buck fever.  Well now that I was within good sight of the creature. It was easy to see what it was.  It finally stood up, and I didnt know up until that point how big it really was.  <BR><BR>Now, I had a roommate who was 6''7 and this creature would have easily stood over him.  At the best guess I would have to say that it was 7''6 tall, and it had to weigh over 400lbs.  It finally turned to me and made me out in a second, but when it turned, it didnt run away instantly.  It just stood there.  I guess it was trying to see what I was. We must have looked at each other for 10 seconds or so, but it felt like 10 minutes. And in that time all I could see was that the creature had dark reddish brown hair, and the arms easily hung down to the creatures knees. <BR><BR>But within an instant something spooked it. The creature turned and looked down river, and it just took off.  Now the ground that this thing covered was amazing.  I didnt move for a good bit, because I was in shock.  After the creature had left, I did the same, once I could get my feet working again. <BR>", :environment "Slack part of a creek, with thick woods all around.", :fixed_year "2003", :run_time "2022-05-20 16:14:27.000000"} {:nearestroad "Forest Service Road 13N01", :date "5", :locationdetails "At Arcata, California take Highway 299 East.

The first night we stayed at Onion Lake on Onion Mountain located on forest service road 13NO1. We spent all afternoon setting up camp, takeing pictures and looking around Onion Lake for Sasquatch evidence. Around 9 p.m, just as it got dark, we heard a loud grunt roar down from a hill top just above our camp. The grunt we heard can only be described as something exhaling a great amount of air all at onece. The grunt was very loud, very rough and only lasted for a second. My brother turned to me and said,\"WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT\"? At that moment a deer ran down the hill from the direction of the grunt and into our camp. Then out of the darkness, another grunt roared through the forest from our right at a distance we thought was about 100-150 yards out from our camp. Then we heared a grunt that strait out from our camp that was at least 400-500 yards out. Then we heared the grunt from up on top of the hill again. Then the grunt to our right answered the grunt on top of the hill and then we heared the grunt that was out 400-500 yards answer the grunt on top of the hill and the grunt to our right. It was as if what ever it was makeing these sounds were communicating back and forth to one another. This grunting was very intense for the fist hour or so then it calmed down a little through out the rest of the night. The last grunt we heared was around 5 a.m just before first light. At one time around 10 p.m, we heared a loud grunt come from behind us over by Onion Lake. I turned on my three miliion candle spot light and searched the forest in the direction we heared the grunt but saw nothing. That grunt could not of been no more than 100 yards away from us and was very loud and rough. Around that same time the other grunts seemed to getting closer to our camp as well and we were starting to get scared. We huddled together in the middle of our camp with our rifles and shotguns in hand along with our three million candle spot light in hand ready to take on what ever it was makeing these loud grunts. We were hearing something we had never heard before in the woods and what ever it was, it sounded like it was VERY BIG by the sound of the grunts these things were makeing. We were scared. If it was not for the firearms we took with us we would of thrown all of our camping gear into our vehicle and we would''ve left a dust cloud a half mile high and twenty miles long as we were getting the heck out of there. We got up the next morning and looked around a little but we did''nt see or hear anything. What ever it was makeing these grunts, they were nocturnal animals and they were only active at night. We could also tell the animals were moveing around in the forest from grunt to grunt. Example: the grunts would get loud and would come from a specific location in the woods and then the next grunt would come from the same general location but a little to the right or left and a little closer or further away than tha grunt before. But we never did hear anything walking through the dry under brush. What ever they were makeing these grunts, they move through the woods very quietly with no sound at all except for their grunts. We packed our camping equipment into our vehicle and we spent the next night down at Louse Camp on Bluff Creek. That night we had no visitors and we returned home to Eureka the next morning. About one month after we returned from our expedition to Onion Lake and Bluff Creek, I was watching a show on the Discovery Channel about Ball Pythons in India. A large fifteen foot snake was crawling on the ground in the jungle as a family of monkeys were going crazy at the sight of the snake. These monkeys looked alot like Chimpanzees but the had black faces and black fur. At one moment, a large male monkey made a loud grunt as he threw a stick at the snake. The grunt was very loud, very rough and only lasted for a second. I came flying off the coutch and said to myself,\"thats what we heared at Onion Lake\". The grunt the monkey made at the snake on the Discovery Channel was the same tone, roughness, length and sounded exactly like the grunt we heared the night of July 5, 2004 at Onion Lake. The Sasquatch is thought to be a large primate of somekind and my brother and I heared loud grunts comeing out the forest at Onion Lake. These grunts I later heared a monkey make on T.V in India. The monkeys grunts were identical to the grunts we heared at Onion Lake. I''m not a scientist or expert on grunts, but I think this is very interesting. My brother and I were raised here in Humboldt County, California and have lived here in the heart of Bigfoot country all our lives. We have been interested in the Sasquatch/Bigfoot for as long as we can remember and we plan on makeing other Bigfoot expeditions in the future because the sounds we heared comeing out of the woods at Onion Lake on the night of July 5, 2004 makes us wonder even more now about whats really out there.", :environment "Mountain Ridge with large Douglas Fir Trees.

We stopped at the Aikens Creek campground (West of Orleans, CA and just west of Bluff Creek on HWY 96) at approximately 6:00pm, as it was too late to hike in anywhere that evening and the Six Rivers NF website listed it as one of the campgrounds open through November. As we neared the pay station a sign deferred us to render payment directly to the campground host, and as we approached the host''s site it became clear that the site was vacant with just a few small items left behind. So, we took the liberty to drive in and explore the portion of the campground that was open. Driving near the Southern edge (nearest to the Klamath river) we smelled a pervasive \"skunky\" odor, but thought nothing of it at the time.<BR><BR>Eventually we pulled into a campsite (second or third from the entrance at the foot of a large hill). Our intent was to get out of the pickup (leaving the dog inside), get on our rain gear and set up the tent as quickly as possible, as it was already quite dark and raining. Just after donning my rain gear, however, I heard some distinct \"hoots\" from within the woodline which were decidedly not owl-like nor quite human-like, but could be most accurately likened to those of an ape. I asked my friend if he had heard that, but he had not, as he had two hoods pulled up over his head. I quickly scanned the woodline with my head lamp, seeing nothing out of the ordinary through the dark and rain. We began setting-up the tent when I heard it again. \"There.\" I said, \"Did you hear it that time?\"<BR><BR>\"No.\" he responded, but he did pull his hoods down. Shortly thereafter we both heard another set of \"hoots\".<BR><BR>\"What do you think that is?\" he asked.<BR><BR>I have had a casual interest in the Sasquatch phenomenon since childhood and find its existence to be scientifically plausible. I am also quite comfortable in the wilderness, having spent much of my life in the outdoors from Alaska to Costa Rica professionally, academically and recreationally, but I never honestly expected to experience anything first-hand with such a creature. So, being educated and reasonable, I declined to respond.<BR><BR>As we continued, we began hearing other noises. First we heard \"whacking\" sounds of wood against wood (more probably stick against tree). Perceiving this \"hooting\" and \"whacking\" as a less-than-friendly display, we became a little nervous and contemplated leaving; but curiousity and the dread of packing up, moving to an unplanned location and reconstructing in the dark, while already soaked; compelled us to stay. So, we continued constructing the tent between periodic scans of the area.<BR><BR>The \"whacking\" continued and we noticed it would come from different locations in short sequence (too short for one individual to move from point A to point B). Again my friend asked: \"What do you think that is?\"<BR><BR>I gave the guarded response: \"I''ll tell you what, I''ve spent alot of time in the woods and observed alot  of animals, but I''ve never heard anything like this.\" I assume he read through the evasion to the meaning of my response, given the ubiquitous usage of the word \"Bigfoot\" , and images thereof, in the surrounding communities and some casual conversation we had had on the subject during our drive.<BR><BR>Shortly before turning in for the evening, I heard a short series of what sounded like heavy footsteps on the rocky terrain of the hillside, in the rhythm of a two-legged walk. Turn in we did, however, with senses piqued and dog tucked securely within the tent. We slept intermittently and restlessly hearing sounds throughout the night.  Most frequently we heard the \"whacking\"; most regularly a rather hollow-sounding report originating from a point some distance to our Northeast and up the hill. We would, however, periodically hear closer and clearer \"whacks\" from varying locacations to our general Southeast; once hearing a disturbingly close and firm \"whack\" from our South/Southwest. <BR><BR>I awoke, once, at approximately 3:00am and heard distinct, single-note \"whistles\" from the general direction of the distant, hollow \"whacking\" which were, again, decidedly unbirdlike, yet not quite human. Soon thereafter we were all startled upright by a \"crack\" followed by loud rockslide, terminating distressingly close to our location. My friend informed me he had heard two other, smaller slides earlier that night. After all was quiet for some time (except the perpetual \"whacking\") we eventually slumbered down again, awakening to sunlight and (finally) quiet surroundings.<BR><BR>In the daylight we observed that the hillside was quite steep, rocky and slightly parabolic in shape, and the rock slide ended up in our South adjacent campsite, leading us to conclude that: 1. Inspection of the hillside would be dangerous and turn up little or nothing in the way of footprints; 2. Sounds could have originated from well up the hill and carried down the \"amphitheater\" hillside; 3. If it were people playing a prank, they must be extremely dedicated to risk their lives negotiating that hill in the dark and rain and to wait in the woods any given night for the off-chance campers might come by in November; 4. Though rock slides may naturally occur there on occasion, they certainly must not occur on the order of three a night or someone would implement measures to ensure no one camp in that location; 5. Maybe that \"skunky\" smell we had encountered just previously was not a skunk.<BR><BR>At any rate we drove on the next morning to the Willow Creek Ranger''s Office (making no mention of the events) to inquire as to open trails. We were instructed that much of the back country road system (and corresponding trails) was closed due to the Port-Orford Cedar Root disease, but that we could drive into the Horse Linto Creek area and hike along the closed roads. We took that advice and spent the next five nights uneventfully.<BR><BR>We decided to return to Aikens Creek for the final night (Saturday, Nevember 22)  to take advantage of the open, flat space to dry wet equipment and see if we could observe anything further. We picked an open site midway between the foot of the hill and the highway, layed out equipment for drying, then decided to day-hike somewhere nearby. We drove up Bluff Creek Road to its closure at the road junction to Fish Lake then hiked 1.6 miles down that road.  I payed close attention to the steep clay roadsides, and once noticed what could have been a partial footprint of a large, humanlike foot from the heel (about 4\" in width) to a point about 6\" forward (and perceivably midway along the length of the foot. I found, however, no other footprints or enough context to draw any real conclusion about the impression.<BR><BR>That night, back at the campground, we kept a large campfire and kept some down and dead cedar boughs nearby to throw in for quick brightness if needed. At one point , my dog suddenly barked and charged towards the trees at the edge of the campground just  below the freeway. I halted him and went to investigate, but found nothing unusual. Though better prepared we neither saw nor heard anything further that night. We returned home however with a new awareness.", :environment "Mountainous, steep, rocky terrain.

Then the hair on the back of my neck stood up straight up!  I never had that happen to me before or since.  I believe this happened for no other reason except fear.

Our plan was to search the streambed for prints by day and listen and observe at night with 1st Gen. passive IR gear.<BR><BR>We conducted about 6 hours surveillance per night, with nothing noted.<BR><BR>Site #1: On second day (10? July) I was checking the north side of the streambed about 1/2 mile southeast of our campsite the (Wright Place) when I noticed a flat glade of trees on the south bank and walked across to investigate. After a few minutes in the glade I found a cedar tree with the top twisted off at the 7.5 to 8 foot level. Here the tree was about 2\" thick. Most alarming was that the break, and part of the tree where bark was stripped off, looked moist and fresh; probably occurring overnight, given the dry, and warm conditions. The top of the tree, with a few feet of stripped bark was at the tree''s base. No hairs found. I took pictures and brought the top back to my brother.<BR><BR>Later that day, at a second site (#2) about a mile northwest of our campsite, I found a 50 to70 meter, stretch with over 15 trees similarly broken off at between 4 and 8 feet off the ground. I took a few pictures of these. <BR><BR>Over the Labor Day weekend that same year (31 August to 2 September)<BR>my wife and I returned to the area.

This area we were in had a sighting last year around the month of July.   <BR><BR>The place where we decided to set up was a recent clear-cut that ran along the hillside.   It was about 1000 feet wide and 1200 feet long.   On the edges were fir and oak trees that developed  a thick cover.   Running the width and centered in the clear-cut was a dirt road that the local people and loggers used on a daily basis.   It also provided us with a place to park and set up our sound equipment.   it also became base for our team.   <BR><BR>From our base, looking down into the valley about two miles we could see the town of Johnson.   From or point we were about 1500 feet above the river and town.   <BR><BR>Just prior to dusk, I had two members climb to the top of the clear-cut (about 150 feet in elevation and about 300 feet away from base).   I did this so if anything was to come closer to our base camp, they would have the best field of vision, and with their night vision device would be able to determine what it was.   We also had two way potable radios for the upper lookout and base.<BR><BR>Manny and myself continued to set up the equipment and waited until nightfall. <BR><BR>Because I was scheduled to participate at 10:00 PM in a live broadcast with Jeff Rense &#8220;Sightings&#8221; program, I was insuring that my bag cell phone was working properly.   All the equipment checked out other than the phone worked but had some static in the line.<BR><BR>At 9:40 we started to broadcast.   The sound traveled very well, and seemed to echo forever.   The location we were at easily helped the sound to travel well over five miles from valley to ridge top, and saddle, it covered a large area.   Very happy with the sound, we continued to broadcast a few more times before the Sightings show started.<BR><BR>It was almost 10:00 PM when the phone rang, it was the Sightings show.   The show went fine for the first few minutes, but the static was getting horrendous, cutting Jeff Rense off completely at times.   About ten minutes into this show, Jeff asked me to try and find another location where the reception might be a little better.   A commercial was playing at the time so I quickly contacted the upper team and Manny and told then that I had to move.   I started my vehicle and drove about 600 feet towards the tree line.  I reconnected to the show and was relived that it was a better connection.   <BR><BR>I was in this new location less than 15 feet to the tree line, with visibility not over 5 feet into the trees.   I was parked for a few minutes and heard what I thought was a bear charging me (I am in a convertible) with the window down, not much protection in anyone&#8217;s mind.     I looked for my revolver and it was gone, I must have forgot it with Manny when I was in a hurry to get into a better location!   I sat there for a second, and again I heard this charging, that sounded like a few feet away from me.   This time I started my car got on the radio and told the upper team that I was moving out because of something charging me in the bush.   (Manny didn&#8217;t have a radio, as we were together at base camp and had to share two, one for base and one for the upper team).<BR><BR>I asked the upper team &#8220;do you see anything&#8221; and they replayed no.   I decided to wait it out, as this thing could expose itself to me (although I just realized that my camera was also with Manny).<BR><BR>The show continued on and I would hear footfalls, breaking branches and at least one grunt growl.   I kept asking the upper team if they could see anything and they kept saying no.    I at least had a flashlight, but didn&#8217;t want to use it in fear that I would scare off whatever it was. <BR><BR>Obviously I was becoming very concerned for my safety, not knowing what it was.   But I remained there on a chance I might be able to see a Bigfoot or at least see something.   I heard the charging again and again and finally a crackle in the radio  &#8220;John it&#8217;s looking right at you, can&#8217;t you see it, it&#8217;s about 25 feet away, that ****** is huge&#8221;.   My heart started pounding FAST, and trying to carry on with this live program without sounding distracted was even harder.   <BR><BR>The other upper team member confirmed what they were looking at, it was something that was at least 8 feet tall with shoulders that were 4 feet across.   As I sat in my car, cell phone to one ear, and the other to the forest, I could hear it charge again, and that&#8217;s when they would say, &#8220;it went back into the trees&#8221;, this happened several times.  This sighting went on for several minutes, with the Squatch looking at me by moving its body from side to side trying to get a better look through the trees and brush.   It was also observed moving its arms in a quick motion as if signaling to others.<BR><BR>This whole incident from the first charge heard to the last tree branch breaking, lasted about 30 minutes.   It was by far the one of the most intense moments in my life.<BR><BR>That next day we did search the area and found the soil disturbed where this Squatch was spotted.  Due to the soil condition, it did not allow any prints to be left.   Judging from a tree and stump in the area, it was determined that it was at least eight feet tall but closer to nine feet.   From the Squatches point of view, it had several windows to look at me, and by moving its body from side to side it would have a clear view of my entire vehicle and me.<BR><BR><BR>You can listen to this event by going to sightings.com and clicking on archived shows.

Coincidentally, our encounter occurred that same evening.<BR><BR>At approximately 9:30 p.m., we were in the process of setting up our second tent (there were six of us in the party), and maintaining the campfire when from directly across the road and meadow we heard a type of \"whistle\" or double \"whoop\" (try whistling these syllables \"WEEOOOU, WEEOOOU\") and it was immediately followed by a very intense \"screech\", which I could only compare to a bear cub in danger combined with the intensity of a hawk shriek. One of our younger members (15) insists it sounded like a possessed woman! <BR><BR>Now, I grew up in the mountains of Montana, am familiar with many animals and their sounds, and have never heard anything like this in my life. And until this moment, I have wondered what it was like to have the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. I have never felt this kind of reaction, I repeat -- NEVER. <BR><BR>The sound sequence repeated itself again, followed by a third lone screech. Immediately, we panned the forest/tree line with our flashlights with the intent of at least seeing the reflection of an animal''s eyes. NOTHING. We must have lighted the area for nearly ten minutes following the sound and still saw nothing. As time wore on, we began to relax and go about our business of finishing the tent set-up and dinner. <BR><BR>Then at about 12:30 a.m. (just past midnight, with two of the teenagers already asleep), we again heard the \"whistle - whoop\" immediately followed by the \"screech\", but this time directly BEHIND our camp site up the slope near the picnic areas amongst the trees. Again, we panned the area with lights (I broke out the 2,000,000 candlepower gangbuster spotlight and lit the night ) and still, NOTHING. No movement, no eyes, nothing. After panning around the entire area once again, I noticed movement on the road towards the restrooms and we quickly moved the light in that direction. Walking across the road was a tiny little grey fox, or kit fox. Well, for our needs, that was our mystery animal. (We THOUGHT). We figured it yelped and then made that raucous screech for some other reason. Funny, but that was enough confirmation for us and we went to bed for the night.<BR><BR>At approximately 5:30 a.m., three of us woke at the same time and after a minute or two of silence we again heard the \"whistle - whoop\" followed immediately by the intense \"screech\" and this followed again by a lone \"screech\". But, this time the sound was only about 20 feet from our tent as if it was standing directly on the paved road next to our camp site. We were all unnerved somewhat, but agreed it''s just that darn kit fox again, and didn''t bother to jump out with the video cameras or spotlights. I exchanged words with a person in the other tent (not sure if this \"chased\" it away), but we then heard the same \"whistle\" and \"screech\" again, but far off in the distance as if it were a quarter-mile away. This was the end of our encounter.<BR><BR>The following morning we checked the area for any signs of tracks and found nothing. We also nearly walked the entire circumference of the lake shore searching for signs of any kind and [got] nothing. Please note that we did not HEAR any movement in the brush or any footsteps.

But, I wanted to catch another steele before the river blew out so, I drove down to the river bar as described in the \"Where did it occur?\" section of this report.  <BR><BR>I parked about 30 yards away from the rivers edge, on a dirt road surrounded by dense willows.  I turned off the car and opened the door.  Immediatly I heard two bellows that seemed far off.  I initially thought it was local kids.  The best I can do to discribe the noise is to ask you to try and make it--- put your lips togeather as if to make the sound of a \"B\" then bellow \"Whoooooooop\", wait two seconds and do it again. This is what I heard.  <BR><BR>To this day I can physically emulate the soud. The sound was similar to the bugle of a bull elk.  I used to work as a horse patrol park ranger on the eastern slope of the Rockies in Rocky Mountain National Park, I kept visitors away from the elk.  In addition, I have frequently heard elk bugle near Oric, CA. I know the bugle of an elk.  That''s not what this was.  <BR><BR>Well, I didn''t think much of it so I got my wadders on and proceeded to the rivers edge.  I wadded in up to my thigh and began fishing moving slowly down stream.  The river was probably about fifty yards wide and nearly at bank full about ten minutes went by and I noticed a dark figure down stream an accross the river, seemingly standing behind a large root wad.  I could see what I though was a head and shoulders of a bear or something? It was drizzeling and I couldn''t focus on it at first, I wasn''t sure it was an animal I thought it might just be part of the root wad.  <BR><BR>As I fished down stream I worked my way dirrectly accross from it and looked at it again, I looked right into its eyes, they were dark, it didn''t move. I then saw another to its left, I could see its body from <BR>the thigh up, it didn''t move, it was looking slightly down stream and I couldn''t see its eyes.  <BR><BR>These things looked taller than a man, had flat faces and large round eyes, their shoulders were broad and their arms were long, they were mostly covered in hair although the one on the left seemed to have bald spots on its chest area, like mange.  They stood still, never once moved.  Ikept fising and tried to work down stream of them to a tailout wher I could cross and sneek up on them to get a closer look, the river was to high.  <BR><BR>As I worked back upstream I noticed a cacoon shaped object perched on the root wad overhanging the rivers edge.  It was shaped like a foot ball but was probably 4 feet long and 21/2 feet in diameter (hard to tell at 50 yards).  This cacoon like thing appeared to be neetly wrapped in dry grasses like cat tail or pampas grass blades.  I kept fishing moving upstream of them back toward my car, at one point I looked back to get another look anfd the cacoon like thing and the animals were gone.  A day later I drove to the other side of the river to go see if I could track um but the river had flooded the entire area.  <BR><BR>I don''t follow Big Foot stuff, but I do know no bones have ever been found.  As a scintist this encounter has stimulated me to develope a theory.. I theorize that they warn eachother with this BWhooooop sound, and that the reason we have never found their bones is that they cleverly dispose of them by waiting till the rivers are on the rise, packaging the bones, and putting them in the rivers close to their mouths so that they wash out to sea.  I''m not sure I belive in any of this but thats what I saw and heard and thats my theory.  My second theory is that it was an elaborate hoax preformed by somm sort of Big Foot fan club or somthing.  But why would some one do that on an empty river bar I was the only one there and no one knew I was going to be there.<BR><BR>   ", :environment "The Mad River 100 year flood plane or riparian zone, within dense to scattered willows growing in the fairly flat and wide gravel deposits.", :fixed_year "1999", :run_time "2022-05-20 16:14:31.000000"} {:nearestroad "101 (ave of the giants scenic route)", :date "8 th.", :locationdetails "Like I said earlier, there is this gift shop that is completely contained inside a living redwood tree on the highway 101 ave of the giants scenic route.

We thought there might have been a bear around and worried that they would take off after it and be difficult to catch. We left them outside anyway and crawled into our bags to sleep.<BR><BR>Then the dogs began whimpering and trying to claw their way into the tent. We nervously let them in and not long afterwards began to hear howling; first just one voice but then followed by many voices. I would estimate that the sounds came from about 100 yards away. It was reminiscent of hearing a coyote pack or wolf pack but these were not canine voices. They ranged in pitch from \"childlike\" to adult male and higher female voices. It sounded like a really loud frat party in the middle of nowhere on a stormy blustery night in the dark. It sounded like the people were talking very loud yet howling at the same time.

I was alone laying on my back in a clearing about 100 yards from camp at about midnight, looking up at the stars and admiring the shower when I had the feeling of another presence. This seems to be a common phrase in these situations but I have to say that this feeling of being watched is something I never felt before or after. Makes you wonder about some sort of a higher lever of consciousness or something similiar (dare I say telepathic?).<BR><BR>I got up and cut over to a logging road that went back to camp and was about 20 yards from camp when I heard a rustling off to my right just a few feet away in dense brush. I did not even look to see what it was. I just sprinted the rest of the way back to camp and did not say anything. We were having a good time listening to loud rock and roll music (car stereo with trunk open) and drinking beer when a friend of mine said to me, \"Do you smell that ... what is it??\"<BR><BR>Well ... I had been noticing this odor but had not said anything. It smelled like a cross between an oil refinery (very sulfurish) and had an animal musk smell to it and was VERY VERY strong. I recognized the animal muskiness from my trapping days as a youth, so I told my friend, \"This is an animal.\" My friend said it smelled like diesel fuel and put out his cigarette it smelled so strong. This smell was so strong that it seemed that it had to be right in front of your face. We figured it was coming from a particular stand of trees and decided to walk up and behind this stand to see if we could still smell it.<BR><BR>When we got behind the stand we couldn''t smell it but when we got back around down-wind of the stand we heard something take off downhill and down-wind of us. All we saw was swaying brush where it had gone crashing down the mountain side. Some of the guys wanted to chase it but I convinced them that since it had left that we should leave it alone if it left us alone. Well ... in 15 minutes the smell was back. This time everybody in camp grabbed a gun ... we had a lot of guns and decided to chase this smelly thing down. Except for me and 2 others. I just had a flashlight. Well ... they chased this thing out of the aforementioned stand of trees and could hear it and smell it but could not see it. We could hear it stomping and thrashing around behind the stand of trees. They chased it up a narrow trail that led to a spring.<BR><BR>I was bringing up the rear but only had the flashlight so I went back to camp with the other 2 that had remained.

They came running out of the forest single file screaming in fear. They said the could hear and smell what they were chasing but could not see it and then suddenly there was no sound or smell. At this point they decided that whatever it was had stepped off of the trail and they had run right by it.

Perhaps it was not close enough to a sighting to publish on your site. I originally said that the incident occurred at Mcgee Creek. I was incorrect. It was Deadman''s Creek. It was Summer. I believe the year was 1970. I was 12 years old or so. My friend and I belonged to the Western Conservation Club and went on many outings with the group. We would work at an area (cleaning it up and restoration) half our stay and play the other half.<BR><BR>My friend and I decided that we were going to walk way up the creek to go fishing. More to get away from the adults than anything else. It was mid-afternoon when we started out. The area had very few trails, once you left the immediate camping area. We headed out cross-country staying as close to the creek as possible looking for good fishing holes. We had walked about five miles up the creek towards the mountains when we both got the feeling that we were being watched. We both looked at each other and called each other light-weights and kept on going.<BR><BR>We fished for awhile, by now it was late afternoon. We noticed that there were none of the usual sounds that you hear in a forest such as birds, etc. We still had that feeling of being watched. The sky was starting to look threatening as an afternoon storm was heading down the canyon / creek towards us.<BR><BR>We started back to camp when the storm caught us and lightning started. A bolt of lightning struck the ground on the other side of the creek and up a ways from our location. Directly afterwards, we heard a growling or grunting sound from the area of the strike. We heard the sound of branches breaking in the brush. The sound was moving up the creek away from us and up the mountain. The breaking branches sounded as if they were high up in the trees. The trees in the area are conifers and the dead branches started about six or more feet up the trees from ground level -- so whatever was breaking the branches, it had to be pretty tall.<BR><BR>The object was moving fast because it was soon out of hearing distance. You know as well as I that sound travels a long way in the woods and we were in a canyon so the object was really moving. We never noticed a foul odor or saw anything conclusive. I did, however, see a large shadow moving through the woods briefly.<BR><BR>Please understand that although we were very young we had a lot of experience in the back country. We knew what the indigenous animals looked like, their habits and the sounds that they make. This growling did not sound like anything that I ever heard before or since. I know that this will sound funny but a person knows when things are not quite right and this was not right. Just a feeling.<BR><BR>We could not return to the area to look for footprints as the lightning strike caused a fire and the camp site was evacuated by the USFS.

My father also grew up there. He was born in Klamath Falls, Oregon, but grew up in the eastern SF Bay Area.  He has a BS in Forestry, A Masters in Zoology, and A PHD in Entomology, and worked as a research scientist with the U.S. Forest Service.  For most of his 20-30 years of service, my father did research on insects that predate timber harvest species in California and Oregon.  When he did his research (usually in the summer and fall) my younger brother and I would accompany him into the woods.  My father was and is a great woodsman, a hunter and fisherman, who taught my brother and myself all about the forests and what types of plants and animals lived there.  My father was also a man of science and this is important to note as will become evident later.<BR><BR>At the end of each summer season, my family and some other forestry families would get together and take several weeks of vacation.  Most often, we would load canoes and float down the lower 15-30 miles of the Klamath River to its mouth.  My father and I would fly fish for steelhead in the riffles during mornings and evenings and we would spend the hot hours of the day canoeing, exploring, resting, etc. These trips would often take one to two weeks to complete.  During one of these trips (probably in 1969 or 1970, I was about 8-9 years old I think...) we made camp on the river bar at the mouth of Tek-Tah creek.  There was a good flat bar there, and at that time of year, the creek was flowing under the sand and apeared dry. One afternoon, while everyone else was napping, my father and I took a walk up the creek bed to see if the creek was flowing on the surface somewhere inland.  About two hundred yards upsteream, the creek did come to the surface and flowed sluggishly thruogh a series of large pools. I remember my dad telling me that these pools were probably full of baby salmon and steelhead waitng for fall rains to allow them to swim down to the main river and out to sea.  My dad had a very scientific mind and he would describe natural processes in great detail when we had the patience to listen.<BR><BR>As we proceeded inland up the creek, we rounded a bend and entered a long, sandy bar on the east side of a long arching pool in the creek. As I looked across the surface of this bar, I saw a set of tracks in the soft sand. These tracks caught my attention because they were very large, and the space between them seemed very long, like if I laid down next to them, they would almost be further apart than the legth of my body.  The tracks also seemed to sink alot deeper into the sand than the footprints of my dad, who is pretty big (6'',2\"). The tracks began at the water''s edge at the lower end of the bar, and proceeded diagonally across the bar in a straight line to the far end of the bar.  <BR><BR>My father had never told me any stories about bigfoot  (he would deny the existence of any animal that was \"unknown\" until science recognized it anyhow) and to my knowledge, I had not heard of any such animal at that time, nor had I any thing more than a passing interest in these types of things then, but these tracks...thier size, gait, and the way they led across the bar in a strieght line...they made a funny impression on me.  My father was also very interested in the tracks, he asked me please not to walk near or in them, then asked me to sit down while he spent several minutes comparing his foot size to them, and trying to match thier spacing by walking next to them.  He seemed very tense, as if he sensed something, or was trying to figure something out.  Eventually, I got bored of sitting and got up and followed him. When I finally caught up with him, we were half-way up the bar.  He had stopped looking at the tracks and was instead looking intently at the timber ahead and at the southern edge of the bar.  He was very quiet and tense.  I have never seen my father frightened or worried about anything before, or since for that matter, but watching him the way he scanned the surrounding forest so intently, made me very nervous and excited.  I broke the silence and began to ask him what he thought made the tracks and what was he trying to see in the trees...He turned around, almost jumping a little in suprise, and told me to be quiet.  then he looked around some more, and started back towards the camp with a qick pace, grabbing me by the hand, and saying these are the tracks of a big bear, son, and we should leave this area alone from now on.  Then he told me not to come up the creek alone, and not to tell Mama or my brother or any of the others anything about what we saw, that it might worry them or something, and that he would speak no more of this matter.  Just like that!  <BR><BR>Well the older I get the funnier that incident and those tracks seem to me. I have hunted for many years and have seen and tracked many animals in the woods since that time, and have never seen anything like that since.  I am thirty eight now, and my father has retired. I asked my father about this incident last year, and he was silent and pensive for a long time, then he told me that he does''nt remember this time or seeing anything other than bear tracks. I don''t know what we really saw that day, but I do know that it scared my dad, and he has never ever spoken to me the way he did on that day, or behaved that way since.

We woke up the three others and all listened.  Whatever it was outside was poking at the old rotted boards around the bottom of the shack.  We could hear it shuffle around and pry at some of the boards.

I was far ahead of my friends and decided to scare them as they came up the trail so I climbed up some rock cliffs for a better advantage and settled down within some Huckleberry bushes to wait for my friends.  After things quieted down I noticed a heavy smell and started looking around.  The breeze was blowing straight from the brush behind me and I felt the hair on my neck starting to rise up. My two friend were nowhere in sight.  I noticed a small movement in the berry bushes right behind me.  I stood up ready to run when this thing stood up also.  It didn''t hesitate but turned and walked off into the brush.  I heard trees snapping and the crunch of dry leaves echo away as I ran back to my friends who were still two hundred yards away.

My friend and I were bear hunting up in Humboldt County on the Hoopa Indian Reservation. It was in March or April. Back then bear hunting was open all year long in Humboldt County, and there were no limits. We were from Southern California, and were totally unfamiliar with the area. We stopped in a town on the Trinity river, I believe the name of the town may have been Willow Creek, I''m not sure. Anyway we met some Indians in town, and asked them, if they knew of any good places to hunt bear. They said they didn''t, but added, that there was an old man in the grocery store who may be able to help us. The Indians pointed to an old blue 1950 Buick parked in front of the store, and told us that the car belonged to the old man, so we waited there until he came out. When he came back to his car, we introduced ourselves, and asked him if he knew of any good places to hunt bear. He told us it was pretty good up on the Hoopa Reservation, and gave us some general directions. We ended up on an old deserted dirt road high in the mountains in my friends dads 1949 (4) door Chevy. We kept going up until we hit snow, started to fishtail, and the right rear wheel went over the side. We set the hand brake and got out of the car to evaluate the situation. We decided to get the bumper jack out of the trunk, and jack the car up, and then push it off of the jack back on the road. The plan worked and all 4 wheels were back on the road. We backed down the road until we came to a place where we could turn around. By now it was dusk, and we decided we had better pitch our tent before it got too dark. At the turn around spot next to the road we saw a big pine tree and decided to set up camp under the tree. By the time we pitched the (4) man umbrella tent it was dark. We put all of our sleeping gear and firearms in the tent and lied down, and were talking for about ten minutes, when we heard the first grunt outside the tent. We both pretended that we didn''t hear anything and kept talking. Then it did it again, and this time we both stopped, and I asked my friend if he heard that. He said he did, and also heard it the first time. I said yeah, me too. Now, we both shut up and listened. We could hear it circling the tent, because the ground was covered with bark, and we could hear the bark crunching under its feet. We could also hear its very loud breathing. By the sound of its footsteps and its breathing, we figured whatever this was, it was huge and it was walking on (2) feet. It circled the tent several times, and we decided that one of us should go out and see what it was. Niether of us wanted to go out, because we were scared, so we decided to flip a coin to see which one of us would go. My friend lost. I then suggested that before he went out, it may be wise, to fire the 44 mag out of the tent flap first. He concurred, and stuck the barrel out of the flap and fired 5 shots. We then both went out, he had the 44, and I held the light. We looked all over and didn''t see a thing. We went back in the tent, laid down, and were  trying to figure out what had just been outside of the tent. We had never heard of sasquatch. We had been talking for about 5 or 10 minutes when we heard a very loud high pitched scream, that lasted for about 5 seconds, and sounded like it was about 50 to 100 yards away. We looked at each other and asked, what the heck was that? That was one heck of a scream. We talked a little longer and then went to sleep. The rest of the night was un-eventful. We arose the next morning and went outside, and looked around the circumference of the tent for footprints. We couldn''t see any, because the ground was covered, with many years accumulation of bark from the huge pine tree we were camped under. We had wondered many times, what it was, that had been outside our tent that night and often talked about it. Then one day several years later, I happened to be in the barber shop, getting a haircut. I picked up an Argosy magazine, and it had the now famous controversial picture of the female sasquatch on the cover. I read the article, and in the article there was a map with an X on it. The X indicated where the picture was supposedly taken. The X on the map wasn''t far from where we were camped that night. That''s when I made the connection and since then after reading about many encounters I am pretty well convinced that the animal that we had heard outside of our tent 41 years ago was a sasquatch.", :environment "It was in the mountains just along side a dirt road that was on a ridge.

As kids would do we wandered off in the woods and found an old logging road that we decided to walk up.  About 15 minutes up the road we heard a noise in the woods on the other side of the road, we huddled together and waited to see who was there. We saw a creature on the other side, in the trees.  We began to run back down the road and the creature kept pace with us although we knew due to the size it could easely go faster. it stayed in the brush and trees and when it would get ahead of us, it would stop and watch us but never came across the road just followed and watched from across the road.

My name is J. C. and I am a 41 year old Vice President of a bank. I have been harboring an encounter I had for 31 years secretly out of fear of ridicule or shame. But now that I have seen other people have had similar situations, I must tell my story. During September 1972, I was hiking down from a lake with my dad and my friend on a fishing trip. We were at a place called Barney Lake out of Mammoth, California, and were on our way home. After a weekend of camping and fishing we were backpacking out from the lake. I was the lead person going down the trail. I had outpaced my friend J. C. and my dad by about 4 minutes without knowing it as I was moving quickly down the trail. After about 10 to 40 minutes down the trail from Barney Lake (I can''t remember exactly after all these years) I came into a clearing. It was a small flat grassy meadow from the trees which I had been seeing downhill till then. I took a break to rest from my fast strides and looked out over the meadow. The first thing I saw was a big white rock boulder near the end of the meadow. The meadow was maybe 20 yards by 30 yards of grass. At the point of the clearing to my left I heard extreme thrashing going on. I looked over to my left to see a large animal bent over with its rear end facing me. It was only about 12 feet away from me. I saw that it was hairy and had a reddish, orange, brown multicolor mix hair to it, and most different was a rear end that was bare like a monkey''s. I knew this because at this time in my life I spent most of my lunch hours in the library reading zoology and marine biology books. I thought this was very strange because no bear could bend over at the waist and have skin over its rear end like this. In my fear I was frozen, shocked and bewildered at the same time. I had never known or heard of big foot or sasquatch at this time in my life. At this point it had been maybe 5 or 6 seconds and then the animal lifted up and stood erect. It was enormous. It must have been 8 feet tall or more, and for a 10 year old boy this was unreal. It had been scratching with its hands and grubbing and digging prior to looking for what I thought was food. Its back was to me when it stood so I could see it was built similar to a human but with a lot of hair. I knew this was no bear from my background. I also knew only black bear were seen as an almost extinct species here during this time, and would have been much smaller in height and stature. I got so scared I ran full pack towards that big white rock. I literally dove over the top, pack and all, and snuggled against the rock, so scared to even look, in case the creature heard me. Finally after about 20 seconds or so, I peeked over the rock to see nothing and no one on the trail. Within 1 or 2 minutes, my dad and John came down the trail and into the opening. I started screaming at them \"look out, look out,\" in fear that the creature was still there and would do something to them. They froze,  bewildered, looked left to where I was pointing and then back to me in confusion. They were standing at the clearing at the spot I had been at. I finally came out and walked to them and looked into the trees and thick brush only to see broken brush, twigs and some hair there. We moved on finally and I never spoke of this again except to my dad and a couple of close friends. Around 7 or 8 years late I saw a couple of bigfoot movies including the Patterson video. Once I saw this, I knew without a doubt this was what I saw. I still kept my story a secret out of fear, but this vision haunts me and will all my life. I know it was so real. I will never forget this and take it to my grave. I am now someone who needs answers and must try and find out that this creature does exist or I will not put my memory to rest. I know what I saw was no figment of my imagination or hoax. I want to seek it out. Anyway, I hope this eye witness helps some where some how.", :environment "Pine forest, fairly thick,and low brush.

We were walking along an old camp road that had become overgrown with brush and scrub.  <BR><BR>It was obvious that bear had been using this trail as there was a considerable amount of bear sign along the old road.  We got to a point in the trail where there was an overhang of pine limbs over a slight depression on the right side of the old road.  Upon inspecting the depression we noticed what appeared to be a left foot print, and a right leg outstretched in the pine needle cover on the ground.  We continued to survey the area, and noticed what appeared to be more tracks leading away from this overhang and depression.  I took photos with a disposable camera.  I have the prints, but they did not come out very clear.  Which was a disappointment, but something to look at nonetheless.  <BR><BR>We finished poking around, and continued on our way.  We got just a bit further down the trail, and we walked through an extremely strong smell of skunk, or wet dog-like odor.  No sooner had you smelled it that is disappeared, but if you took a few steps back it was extremely strong again.<BR><BR>I have been hunting and recreating outdoors for many years, and I am very familiar with skunk spray, and how it seems to permeate a large area.  This was not simply the spray of a skunk.  It was very centralized.  It was literally like you walked through it, and it disappeared, then you could turn around and walk through it again.  <BR><BR>The two of us spent a few moments looking around, and we noticed, something very peculiar.  In the middle of the trail and not far from this smell, and the foot prints we had seen, was a large pile of oak acorns.  The strange thing was there was not an oak anywhere near this pile of acorns!  They seemed to have been placed in this location.  They were not a collection of shells from squirrels, they were fresh dropped acorns.  Enough to hold a hungry deer, or two for a little while.<BR><BR>We theorized that whatever had been hunkered down under the pine overhang in the depression may have placed these acorns, then set up under the overhang off of the trail in ambush.<BR><BR>Our intent was to walk to the back of Pine Mountain, then still hunt our way up to the top of the mountain.  We had used this road for years to access the back of the mountain, and we were very used to the topography, so anything out of the norm would be noticeable to us.  <BR><BR>Chris and I team hunt very well together and after a short strategy chat, decided to use a 50 step method: one of us would go 50 steps, stop and whistle to let the other hunter know it was their turn to take 50 steps, and then just watch and listen.  We were approximately 130 yards apart.<BR><BR>The ground was covered in heavy and dry leaf litter so the going was somewhat noisy.  I had gone nearly three quarters of the way to the saddle at the top, and I heard what sounded like a whistle, but not the whistle I recognized as Chris''.  I also heard what sounded like a very large boulder break loose and roll down the back of the hill.  I had assumed that Chris had rolled it down hoping to kick something out, but based on the last whistle, this rock was rolled from that area, and seemed to be 60 yards to my right, when Chris would have been twice that distance away from me.  I though that maybe he had gotten closer to me as we made our way up, but that would not have been the case in the past.  We work very well together and spacing is everyhting on our team hunts.<BR><BR>We got to the top of Pine Mountain, and we had a discusion and he told me that he thought I had rolled the boulder, and vice versa.  I told him about the whistle, and he told me the exact same thing.  He also had this overwhelming feeling of being followed up the hill.

Having been there once before four years earlier with a church youth group, and consequently having had a blast, we wanted to camp in the same campground and generally do a lot of the things we had done on our first trip, but without the constraints of adult supervision. We where both twenty years old at this time. <BR><BR>We camped at a place called Lost Creek campground, which sits just inside Lassen National Park along its northern border with Lassen National Forest. On the second day we decided to take a late afternoon hike down an old somewhat overgrown logging road just on the other side of the national park/national forest boundary fence.  We knew of this road and its destination because we had hiked it four years earlier.  This road was lined with tree stumps, and had decades of old logging debris, and it had permanent tire grooves in the dirt.  As this road heads north down the slope from our campground it runs about 3000 ft., until it ends at a fire road running east to west.  We hiked west on this road about 100 yards to where the road runs along side a small meadow to the north. We hiked across this meadow to a creek called Lost Creek, hence the name of our camping site.<BR><BR>After soaking our feet in the icy water, my friend said we should probably head back up to camp as it was getting close to 7:00pm and he didn''t want too get stuck down there while it got dark.  We crossed the meadow back to the fire road and started walking east.  We then noticed on the road about 200 yards ahead of us, what at first glance appeared to be a large naked man with a dark complexion, walking away from us.  At second glance I thought maybe he isn''t naked but he''s wearing a fur coat with a pointy hood.  I remember saying to my friend \"take a look at this guy\". A few seconds later the figure stopped in its tracks and moved to the left side of the road, the whole time with its back to us.  I got the impression that he/it had noticed something and went to investigate.  A few seconds later it continued on its way with a very swift and deliberate gate, arms swinging slightly.<BR><BR>I think what sticks in my mind the most was the bawdiness of the shoulders.  In fact, I remember this character had a well defined hourglass figure.  He/it remained on the road for what seemed like a full minute, the entire time it was walking away from us, with his back to us. The more I watched the stranger I thought the situation was.  Eventually the figure disappeared from view, either around a bend in the road or up into forest to the left, I could not determine the direction.  We didn''t say too much about what we had just seen, however we seemed to walk a little more quickly back to camp.  I know I was a little nervous.  I can''t really put a size to this figure, because of the distance at which we viewed it, but if pressed, I would have to say it was over 6''5\" tall and about 270lbs., maybe even 300lbs. <BR><BR>The rest of the evening was uneventful, but the next morning at about 5:45am we both were awaken by what sounded to us, to be a series of powerful yelps and growls coming from the general direction of the area where we were hiking the day before.  I don''t know if any other campers in the area heard this. <BR><BR>My friend and I never really discussed this event among ourselves; or anyone else for several years, until for some reason, I brought it up once.

We went over there and unlocked the gate as he had a key. We went in there and we had brought some apples for our lunch and all. We seen he had hogs and started feeding them these apples. After about 1/2 hour of doing this, we heard the horses behind the house or cabin, running around and making all kinds of noise. <BR><BR>We could not see what was going on as; the house was in the way. But, man were they going nuts!!!  So, we all said to each other, let''s get over there and see what''s up. We did and could not see anything but the horses still going nuts and running in circles. We then looked over this fence and threw a gate and seen these huge foot print''s and smelled something like a dog that''s been wet and rotten egg''s mixed.

They were also, 2 to3 inches longer than my foot and much wider.<BR><BR>Then I tried to step that far with my step, and no way could I.

I could not even lift my leg that far, and I was 16 years old and pretty limber. No man could lift there leg that high or step that far! No man!!!  Nowhere did we see bear tracks and even if we did, they don''t walk that far on 2 legs. Whatever this was, it walked along this fence and turned and went back into the woods, and then up this very steep hill. It must have looked at the horses and maybe seen us feeding the hogs. I never seen it, but we got scared and left that ranch. <BR><BR>I have told this story to a few people, and they look at me like, it could be, but you can tell, they don''t think this is real.  But, when you see things like this, you just know something is out there. Nobody could change my mind on this one as, I know what I seen and it was not set up as, nobody knew we were going to his ranch, and the next ranch over, nobody was home there either. So, the only thing that could be is, this was real and not faked. Nowhere did we see any human foot prints by any of these tracks or up that steep hill. I know something is going on up there. <BR><BR>N.

My best guess is 1978 or 1979.  My father, mother, younger brother and I were camping in a State Park off of Highway 101, in Mendocino County, CA.  Our parents were in their late thirties, I was 16 or 17 and my brother was 10 or 11.  (Of course these ages are approximate and may have been a year or two less or more).  We also had our dog with us, a 60-pound Black Lab - Dalmatian mix.  It was late July to early September and very likely Labor Day or the weekend after Labor Day.  <BR><BR>The park in situated on both sides of the Eel River, and is for the most part second growth or new growth Redwood forest mixed with other trees and brush of the area.  The main section of the park is next to Highway 101. The far side of the park, away from the highway and across the river, is only open from the end of May to the middle of September.  The rest of the year the access bridge is removed and stowed above the high water line. The far side of the park has more foliage and is frequented by bear, deer, raccoon, skunks and other animals.  We were camping on the far side of the park as far up the hill as possible.<BR><BR>I believe this event occurred toward Labor Day or the weekend after Labor Day for the following reasons; we had something of a ritual in making a final &#8220;end of the Summer&#8221; trip to this park, the park was very quiet meaning other campers had made an early start home to avoid holiday traffic or were not there at all being the weekend after Labor Day, and on this particular morning my father stayed in camp to do some paper work.  He was a high school math teacher so he usually did lesson plans or other work only in the late summer.<BR><BR>Mom, my brother, the dog and I decided to take a short hike up a trail on the edge of the campground.  The trail worked its way up over the crest of the hills for about two miles and ended above a barn and farm located in a clearing at the bottom of the other side of the hills.  The trail is mainly up hill, makes several cut backs, and passes across two or three unpaved fire roads.  It was a clear sunny day and there was no one else out on the trail.  <BR><BR>Our dog liked to take the point position to see the animals ahead.  She was an avid hunter of rabbits and liked to chase deer.  I had often seen her race after deer, taking dangerous inclines and thick brush at full speed.  On this day I do not recall her scaring up anything to chase.  The three of us talked as we went up the trail.  During the last half mile to quarter mile of the trail my mother gave us a serious order to stop. We paused while she looked and listened to an area behind us to our left.  She asked if we heard any thing, but I do not recall if my brother or I did.  <BR><BR>We walked on, more slowly now, listening to the forest.  After about 50 yards we felt like we could hear something moving in the woods, behind us to our left, and once again stopped.  The noise stopped when we stopped.  This time we indicated that we did hear it.  The dog was in the middle of the trail listening as well but did not go into the brush to investigate.  We continued on now for another 50-100 yards and we were almost to the crest and the vista area.  Again we thought we heard the noise paralleling us to our left but were not 100% sure.  We all stopped again.  Before we could again acknowledge the sound, there was a loud wooden knocking noise off to our right.  It was 3-4 quick &#8220;knock - knock - knock &#8211; knock&#8221;.  Initially I thought it was two tree trunks rubbing together in the wind.  I looked up to see if I could see anything, but there was no breeze.  Before I could look back down, there was a loud forceful huffing of air coming from the bottom of the tree.  It was something like a growl but not quite.  It was low and guttural, and was a rapid exhalation of air from a very large animal.  <BR><BR>Whatever it was, that was enough for us.  It was my mother who spun around and said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s go.&#8221;  No one disagreed and we turned and sprinted all the way back to camp.  I think we covered the two miles without a stop.  Instead of taking the lead, the dog took up the rear position, which in my mom&#8217;s opinion was meant to protect us from whatever was behind us.  This was the first and only time we heard anything like that and was the only time we have ever even contemplated running in fear during a hike.  I do not recall any smell in the area. <BR><BR>The incident has never felt right to me and I have thought back to it on several occasions.  My mother has always thought that a bear was stalking us.  (She has always had a very strong apprehension of bears, and always warned us not to get between a cub and its mother, or try to feed a bear or approach any bear.  Nonetheless, we have chased them away on more than one occasion.).  I have heard of stalking behavior in bears before, but only in grizzlies, browns and polar bears &#8211; not in the California black bears.  Additionally, the behavior of the animal did not seem like a bear either, and did not elicit the response from our dog that I would have expected for a bear.  <BR><BR>I discovered this site about 12 months ago and the similarities of other&#8217;s reports with my incident made me think that this was a bigfoot.  Assuming the accuracy of other&#8217;s stories, it seems to be a more plausible explanation than being followed by a bear as well, as a better fit with the facts.  I spoke to my mother recently about it and she still felt it was a bear, besides she said, &#8220;Bigfoot are only up in the Pacific Northwest.&#8221;  I separately spoke to my father about this site and he thought I was pulling his leg.  After I told him that I believed the stories were sincere, and told him some of the common details of the events, he immediately brought up that time &#8220;you guys came running down from the trail.&#8221;<BR><BR>I did not send this sooner because it is a class B and twenty plus years old already.  I have heard a couple of stories regarding other incidents, but none that I have first or second hand knowledge of.   <BR><BR>What may be of interest is that I have seen a nest like the one in Report 2928.  I cannot recall exactly where I saw it but it was within the last 5 years.  It was some where in the Sierras, and I think it was in the Mammoth Lakes area.  I recall being off trail, cutting between lakes, or trying to relocate a trail when I saw it.  In any case it was well off the trail and quite a way from the town or trailhead.  Thinking it was a human&#8217;s hand made shelter, I was surprised at the amount of effort that must have went into building the little A frame.  It was tucked in between some tree trunks and the roof was a tight thatch of broken limbs.  It just struck me that a tent would have been easier to move and set up, and would have afforded better protection overall.  I glanced around but did not see any garbage or clothes or other signs of a camp.  There was no smell that I recall.  I was also surprised at how far away the nest was from the town &#8211; whoever this belonged to was trying to stay well away from the trail and others.  I guessed that it must belong to someone that really wanted to be left alone, so I went on my way.  <BR><BR><BR>", :environment "Redwood forest, new and second growth.

A short distance north is Weott.  I have been a country girl all my life and have spent my life close to the land.  I had always been drawn to the forest and had slept outside when ever possible.  The weekends were made for pitching camp and swiming in the Rattlesnake Creek that runs along the foot of the property.  This time I wanted to spend the night along the side of the river by the deep pool we always swam in. The river has giant boulders to lay on and bask in the sun.  Both sides of the river are steep one side one side is so steep and gravel like you cant even climb it. <BR><BR>Well after much pleading with the people I had brought, they said ok we will camp on the river.  They were drinking a bit much and I was not going to touch it because I was worried they may decide to take a swim and sink.  We had fun with a small campfire we sat and laughed until it was late.  We rolled out our sleeping bags on the bank, the river at our feet and the steep cliff to our heads.  The spot we were in had a bit of a ledge high over our heads.I dont know what time it was when I woke up but I am a light sleeper and I heard the gravel over our heads being walked on. I lay still and listened.  It is moving across the top of the ledge toward my right. There is a deer trial that comes down to creek level about 10 feet away from where I am sleeping and I hear this person coming down it.  I was scared and tried to wake the people closest to me without making to much noise.  Then I kicked the person to my left and he snores louder.  <BR><BR>To my right, this person (I say person because it was two footed by the sound of it) was no more than 10 feet from me.  It stood behind a willow bush/baby tree it was really just 5 or six canes coming out of the stream bed.  It was dark but I could feel its size when it walked and shook the canes.  I kept thinking I am going to kill these @#% guys, why are they sleeping still? <BR><BR>Then the thing started yelling at me.  I know the sound of the animals in the California woods.  I have never heard this in my life.  It was yelling at us \"What the hell are you doing hear, this is my place.\"  It wasn''t like a mountain lion grawling and saying \"I''m tough and I can kick your [butt].\"  It was broken up into batches of sounds with inflections that I recognized. It was like a person speaking another language but you know they are telling you directly to get the hell out of my house.<BR><BR>I could see glimpses of it when its body moved into the light of the river.  Its right side was as tall as the canes I knew to be 8 foot-ish.  It ranted and raved and stomped and shook the bush.  I smelled skunk and thought \"Great this is all I need, they will bury me without a funeral because I am going to stink.\" I finally got my voice and said \"Ok Ok its alright ok ok .\" I did not see or hear it leave.  But I realized at some point it had left.  My encounter lasted only a few minutes but it felt much longer.  I stayed awake the rest of the night and I was so mad in the morning at my fellow campers.

It will help explain the delay in ever having reposted this incident. The sighting occurred about three months prior to my entering the United States Army. I served for three years as a Paratrooper with a Top Secret Clearance. After my time in the service, I became a Los Angeles Police officer. I did that for thirteen years and am now a Federal Agent, working for an O.I.G. out of Washington DC. With that background, you can probably understand my reluctance to discuss this sighting with too many people. It really boils down to a potential career killer. <BR><BR>That being said the incident DID occur and I remember it vividly. Many many years after the event, I reconnected with my friend (the witness) and asked him to tell ME the story as he recalled it. I wanted to check my memory and see if his matched mine. It did. To a T! Only a few months ago, I spoke with my brother in law, a witness after the fact. I asked him if he remembered the event. He did. It should be known that he is not the kind of person that would \"buy into\" such a story, had he not been semi involved. <BR><BR>Anyway, this is what happened: My friend Craig and I were both 17 years old and waiting to leave for Army Basic Training. He was due to leave in June and I would go in August of 1980. We were staying with my Sister and Brother in Law at the time. They lived in a cabin in Green Valley California. Craig and I enjoyed our last months as civilians in that area, and used it to train for the difficult training ahead of us. We ran every day along the mountain roads and hiked the hills, trying to get into prime shape. <BR><BR>In May, we decided to test ourselves and camp out for a full seven days. We knew the perfect place for this would be what we called \"The old campground\" because of its isolated surroundings and terrain that would be perfect for climbing and hiking. So, we packed up a weeks worth of supplies and, though my sister Cindy and her husband Tom offered to drive us, we decided to act like soldiers and walk to the location. We did this with full packs. <BR><BR>My sister and Tom advised us that they would check on us at least every other day and that they would bring us food and lemonade and such. Tom also, offered to provide us with two weapons to be used for protection against any strangers that may try to harm us. After all this was before cell phones and we would be on our own big-time. There was also a heavy rattlesnake threat in that area, so we happily took him up on the offer. Tom met us at an area near the mine shafts later that day and gave us an M-1 rifle and a 12 gauge shotgun, with ammo for both.<BR><BR>The dirt trail that leads off of the main highway goes very far back into the mountains. In fact, were you to traverse it to its end, you would end up on top of what is known as Grass Mountain. Craig and I decided to get about three miles in and away from the highway, which was about a mile past what once was an old 1920s campground, and live deep in the bush like soldiers would. We found a great spot, next to a clear running creek and set up our tent in the clearing that was there. This clearing was completely surrounded by thick woods. Then night fell.<BR><BR>As we lay in our tent talking by the light of flashlights, we both heard the very loud snap of deadfall in the woods behind the tent. We sat up, frozen and listening. We heard what sounded like a very large and heavy person, slowly walking around our site, making no effort to conceal his presence, judging from the loud sound of breaking sticks and brush. We were both scared believing that someone was out there. We exited the tent, Craig with a shotgun and me with the M-1. I started yelling very loud. \"Hey! We know you are there. We have guns and will shoot!\" <BR><BR>Again, we heard the sound of someone walking slowly but methodically around from our left to right. We shinned our lights in the direction but could not see anything but the trees and brush. We talked amongst ourselves, wondering if it could be a bear or something, but we decided that it was a person and not an animal. After much yelling and warning that we would shoot, I decided to fire a few rounds in the direction of the noise (how crazy that sounds now) and I did just that. I fired about three rounds into the trees and the sound was unbelievable. <BR><BR>The weapon blasted and the sound echoed into the night, roaring into the canyons and fading off into the night air. We stood in silence. To our utter disbelief and eventual horror whatever it was, began to move again, still left to right, in a circle around us. What we both thought and discussed later, was that NO animal would have stuck around after the horrific noise of the M-1. Most normal people would not have stuck around either! Whoever or whatever was out there not only stuck around, but appeared, from the casual sound of the slow walking, to be less than concerned about our weapons. We made a decision to vacate the area post haste! Grabbing our coats, we climbed the embankment up to the dirt road, and carrying our weapons, we ran the entire way, about three miles more or less, back to the main highway, San Francisquito Canyon Rd. We spent a very long night, curled up in a concrete drainage ditch, waiting for the sun to rise. Every hour or so, a lone truck would come by and the sound of that brought us comfort. Again, it was a long night!<BR><BR>The next day, we hiked back to the site, expecting to find our tent and all of our supplies missing. To our surprise, everything was as we had left it. Nothing was out of place. We gathered our things, and hiked back to the open area of the old campground. We decided not to sleep in the tent because it limited our vision, and instead, laid our sleeping bags out in an open area, above the creek. After a day of climbing cliffs and cooking and such, night fell again.<BR><BR>That night, just as the sun set and darkness was beginning to fall, Craig and I were walking in the direction of the main road. We were looking for rattle snakes, because we had shot one earlier on the dirt road in the same area. As we walked side by side with me on the left, both holding weapons, we saw it. Standing just on the dirt road, facing us was a Bigfoot. There can be NO DOUBT at all about what it was. We could see it very clearly. He was about eight or nine feet tall and stood with his left shoulder even with the edge of the trail. He was covered with dark hair and had long arms. We did NOT smell anything unusual, as I have since read about other sightings. <BR><BR>The strange thing about him was the absolute indifference in his expression. He did not look threatening. He did not look scared. He just stood there looking at us.almost bored. I instinctively brought my right hand up against Craig''s chest and we both stopped dead in our tracks. We never took our eyes off of the Bigfoot as we spoke. I said, \"Do you see that? Are we seeing this?\" Craig said, What do we do? What should we do?\" We both started to walk backwards as we spoke, very slowly and involuntarily. The Bigfoot just looked at us for a few moments. <BR><BR>Then, and I will NEVER forget the detail of this he just slowly and very casually turned to his left, and began to walk into the forest. When he did that, Craig and I stopped and started talking over each other. \"Do we shoot it? Should we shoot it? What do we do? Do you want to follow it?\" As we talked, we heard a sound that we both immediately recognized from the prior night, the sound of the Bigfoot slowly walking deeper into the woods, breaking deadfall, twigs and branches as he went. We never did fire a shot or follow him. We stayed up late and slept in shifts at the campground and did not hear from the Bigfoot again.<BR><BR>The next day, Tom came up with food and supplies. We ran to him and told him the details of what had happened. It was very clear by his expression that he did not believe us. We took him to the exact spot where we saw the Bigfoot and we discovered a trail of giant footprints leading from the trail into the woods. Tom smiled and told us that we did a good job making them. We were so frustrated and begged Tom to follow the tracks with us. We all followed them and they went into and across the creek. On the other side, we found a large red ant hill with a footprint right on top of it. I asked Tom, how could we have done that? He just shook his head and smiled. We followed the tracks to a point where two large hills formed a valley that sloped upwards into the mountain area. The ground turned rocky and the prints stopped. <BR><BR>That is what happened. I have lived with this memory for many years. I am now Forty Five years old and am less concerned about what people think of me in terms of this incident. It is a fact and because of it, I know for sure that Bigfoot lives or at least once lived in the area of Green Valley California. <BR>", :environment "Pine forest in the high desert area of Southern California.

We made it up to the saddle where the trail goes downhill into the wilderness, and where we were supposed to leave the trail and go south up the mountain, and decided we didn''t feel like going any further. I''m assuming we rested for awhile, and I remember just talking and hanging out. As we were getting up and ready to go, we heard a strange noise coming from the bushes nearby. We stopped talking and listened, and it was a very low sort of growl/snuffling sound. My first thought was that it was probably a bear, but that ultimately I had no idea what it was, and it sounded like it was growling at us. The bushes along the trail there were very high, such that we couldn''t see through them. It scared the hell out of us and so we quickly hoofed it back down the trail. I''m not sure if we ever spoke about it again, except to maybe say I wonder what it was, that was scary, etc.<BR><BR>But afterwards I actually looked through field guides trying to figure out what was making the noise.

In fact I spoke with my ex-brother in-law about this earlier this evening because I happened upon your website and explored it.<BR> <BR>What is very significant is that Sam and Don had every opportunity to shoot this animal and/or person and thought about it, but could not because it looked to human! <BR><BR>Only THREE DAYS later Big Foot reports hit the news. My father and Sam AKA Sandy, in front of me took a forest map out and Sam became quiet as the new sightings were only 15 miles from his encounter, and in the direction the creature was traveling. The newer sightings as I recall put the creature near Pear Blossum, CA on the other side of the mountains. I remember a news report of 1000 people lined up across the desert looking for anything and they did find some hair on a barbwire fence. To this day I know of no one having reported this first encounter three days prior. <BR><BR>Another significant item is that in those days bear season and deer season overlaped or was one in the same. At first they thought this might be a deforemed bear (they had bear tags) as they witnessed this being walking on two legs just like any human and appeared to be 7 to 8 feet tall. <BR><BR>They were a few hundred yards away on the other side of the caynon, (don''t remember the name of the caynon) but their rifle scopes allowed them to see this clearly enough that viewing the face and shape they could not decide if this was an animal or a human. I remember Sandy/Sam saying it looked like a monkey man. The animal/person seemingly did not know they were there. They had bear tags and thought about shooting the creature but as I said could not make themselves do it. I recall Sam telling my father that it had to be a bear because it dropped to all fours when it climbed the steeper terrain. My father asked Sam: How did you guys climb it? The reply was the same as the deformed bear. <BR><BR>About then my brother in-law was no longer jovial regarding the sighting and preffered not to discuss the incident.

As it got light enough to see the top, we noticed someone already on the ridge wearing what seemed to be black of all things. He had no light, and no gun, and we wondered where he came from because we had been camped there for 11 days, and no one had come by that whole time. We watched him dig around in some brush for at least 30 minutes, pausing occasionaly for long periods to just stare in different directions. We joked that it was probably a hunter from L.A. because anyone would be crazy to wear just black during deer, and bear season. Then he began to walk down the hill right for us, now we never left the truck yet, and he would walk a little ways and the stop and look around just as if he was hunting, but with no rifle. He walked just like a human, so at this time there was no reason to think it was anything but a man.

We are San Francisco City people, artist; not hunters. We are not used to the outdoors or accustom to the forest and nature and the shock of fresh clean air.<BR><BR>The first encounter was on Tuesday evening, 8/16/05 at 5:17pm on highway 128 in the Redwood forest. We were on a vacation, driving west on 128 and heading towards Fort Bragg, CA. Once we entered the state park, we stopped and parked to smell the fresh air. I marked the time, because I was shooting with my digital camera. We walked into the forest, on a trail, and were having a great time, enjoying our time alone. There was little traffic or noise from the road. The forest was quiet and powerful. We have lived in the center of San Francisco for 15 years, and were stunned and amazed to experience the silence and peace of the Redwoods. As we got deeper into the woods, about 20 minutes, I started to get uneasy; feeling like someone was watching us. The digital photos my wife took of me show my concern, the longer we stayed. Then we heard it.  It was a growl-grunting. Just above the hearing of my ears. I would described it as infra-sound- a deep sound that was low in pitch, deep, almost inaudible. My body felt it more than my ears. It threw me in a panic. The fear in me rose fast. I looked at my wife and she was feeling the panic. We both looked around. We could not tell the direction. We could not see anything in the thick woods around us. It could have been a bear or a wolf. But my instincts said no. I did not know what it was. But, the \"vibe\" message was becoming clear- GO AWAY NOW! <BR><BR>Predators do not warn-they ambush-right? My wife looked at me and said Did you hear that? I said Yes. She said, Lets get back to the car. I said Good idea!  It was a weird feeling. We were stunned and mystified as we ran back to the car. We drove away nervous and excited about what happened. On our way to Fort Bragg, CA, we were talking about the experience. Was it a bigfoot? Did we have a Bigfoot encounter? We felt something special had just happened. We had to learn more about bigfoots.  <BR><BR>Over the year, I became obsessed with bigfoots. I read as mush as I could about the Sasquatch, Yeren, Almasty, and Yeti as my time permit. My wife became obsessed also. Together we decided to go back to those redwoods and try to make contact with the forest giants. <BR><BR>We made it back to highway 128 on Monday 9/4/06. Something told me to pull over at a different spot. As soon as I got out, I had the DV video camera running. On the camera my wife tells me to make my Whoop-Whoop Bigfoot call, into the redwood forest. As soon as I did, the camera records wood knocking and tree breaking. Soon the smell of a dead animal/skunk filled the air. <BR><BR>The sounds and smells go on for about three minutes,  then stops. I could tell he moved away after my calls to him, inviting him to be photographed. We left the redwood forest, excited about our contact. <BR><BR>My wife wants to see a bigfoot. I do not want to see him.  I hear that many people die or have very bad luck after seeing a Bigfoot. Remember Dr. Morbius from the movie Forbidden Planet?

We live on 2 acres in Redwood Valley, CA.  It was dark and about 6:00 with a mod. overcast sky, the moon peeking through the clouds. We have a small dog that will usually bark in response to any other dog barking in our area.  Houses are well-spaced on our rolling hillside that''s covered with a mix of oak and pines. From Hwy. 101 looking west, you see very few houses on our hillside. Anyway, as I was walking I could hear this very unusual \"animal\" sound unlike any I''ve heard before. It was NOT a dog howling and I''m not even sure how to describe it. We have coyotes and mountain lions and the sound would not fit the description of their cries or calls either. It had a yelling/howl quality that lasted about 5 seconds , would break off and then resume about 15 seconds later. I went in the house to get my husband so that he could hear the sound. My dog was not barking which is really unusual because he''s inclinded to bark at dogs or other unfamiliar sounds.  None of the dogs on our hillside were barking either which seemed odd to me. I was kind of scared .  My husband came out and listened. His initial response was, \"Anyway, it''s on the other side of that hill.\" I said, \"It''s not a dog, and our dog is not barking at it.\"  He agreed it was strange but wasn''t concerned. Soon thereafter, a dog could be heard barking and our dog started in with his typical barking response. The unusual sound stopped and I didn''t hear it again. This is not the first time we''ve heard  unusual sounds that we can''t identify. We woke up one night hearing whooping sounds outside the house that I can''t connect with any animal I''m familiar with. My daughter has also heard whooping sounds on the same hillside where we heard the unusual sounds last night. My teenage son heard whooping sounds last summer in the manzanita to the north of our house. We had an odd experience last summer. My college aged son and his friends were imitating \"Big Foot\" sounds that they''d heard on the internet . It was about 11:00 at night when they were fooling around , loudly imitating the sounds.  About 1:00 AM, that same night, we were watching a video and we heard a scratching at the window. We all thought my son was outside trying to scare everyone. All of a sudden , water was splashing all over the side of the house. A water sprinkler pipe outside the window had been snapped off, and water was geysering out of the pipe. My son walked out of the bathroom and it turned out he''d been in the house all along. No one had been outside and we still wonder how the pipe was snapped off. Whatever had been scratching at the window had apparently broken the pipe.  We all wondered if it was a response to the Big Foot calls that the guys had been making.

I remember thinking that it was either a person walking very leisurely or something bigger walking at a normal gait. I didn''t quite know what to do so, on an impulse, I made a growling sound. Then the footsteps stopped, but resumed a few seconds later. I repeated the growl and the same thing happened.

He was about 7'' tall and had a slender body like a basketball player with big strong shoulders, and a real skinny waist. The legs were really muscular, and strong.  The arms were long, as were the fingernails, and fingers. He had no clothes on whatsoever, and the bigfoot&#8217;s body was covered with about 2\" of hair with a few bald spots showing skin.  Its hair was black, and cut off about even with the upper neck. Its forehead was gunpowder gray with the temple area being purple red down the side of the face partway then dark tan.

My father was a commercial fisherman, and had his boat docked up the Albion River about 250 or 300 yards at the boat docks.  We lived in Ukiah, and came over to see my Dad to bring supplies to him and visit at least twice a week. Soon after, we put a trailer on the flats near the boat dock, and moved to the coast permanently.  The encounter happened one evening just before dark, as the sun was just going down over the hill. My parents, younger sister, and younger brother were on the boat and getting ready for bed. It was before 8 p.m.  My older sister and myself had to sleep in the car as there wasn''t enough bunks on the boat for us to sleep. We had blankets and pillows on the seat to sleep on.  The car was a 1957 two-door Pontiac Chieftain. I had the back seat and she the front. I remember it being too early and light out to want to go to sleep. We sat there and talked as teenagers will do. Across the river was a steep rolling hillside that had sheep grazing on it that belonged to a man named Paul Anderson. We had the windows down as it was summer and very nice out. We were interrupted in our talking by the sounds of sheep crying out in unison and baaing in a way that didn''t sound normal for sheep. We both jumped up and looked out the right side windows trying to see what was after the sheep. We could see the sheep running frantically towards the west side of the hillside pasture.  The sheep were scattering in different directions, separating into smaller bunches. To the left  and upper part of the field, we both spotted two very large and hairy animals chasing the sheep.  We thought that they were bears running on their hind legs like trained animals would do. It was very alarming for us to watch as these bears were terrorizing these poor sheep. Our position from the attack was about 150 yards or more. We watched as these big animals chased the sheep for what seemed like hours.  In reality, the whole chase scene was about 20 or 30 minutes. As it got dark, we were sure that the bears would swim the river and come for us next. We locked the doors and hid under the blankets for the rest of night.  It seemed like an eternity til morning came and we could finally get out of the car and go to the boat to see our parents. We told them what had happened, and I know that they thought that we had stayed up all night dreaming up that story. That morning, we were up at the post office near where the attack had occurred, and people were talking about the sheep being killed by a wild pack of dogs that were roaming around. The Sheriff, Sam Costa said that it was unusual for dogs kill and eat only the belly and insides of the sheep. We heard about the wild dogs for years after that, every time livestock were killed and mutilated by a predator.

Forest).  To get to the property, which was located many miles from civilazation, you had to travel on a very rough road (one cut with a dozer) so our motor home could not make it to our lot. Near by was a small pond and a campsite that was for the use of property owners. The pond was about 75 to 100 feet across, the banks were covered in cat tails and the pond was full of trout (we tried all day to catch some fish, without luck). My family(wife, son and 2 daughters) were aware of how quiet it was in the evening, we could not even get a station on the radio. We built a camp fire and were sitting around it watching the field mice run down to the edge of the pond to get a drink. As I remember it was a bright night, the moon was visible overhead. <BR><BR>Along about 10 or 11 pm, the wife and kids went into the camper and went to bed. I remained outside by the camp fire trying to get a station on the walkman radio. About 1am, I was putting out the fire when I saw movement on the other side of the pond, I noticed the movement because of the noise this thing was making. At first I thought it was a deer (I was told they were common in the area) so with that thought I headed toward the sound armed with my trusty flashlite. As I approached, the moonlite was very bright, I could see lots of movement in the cat tails but could not see the animal. At this point it hit me that maybe it was a mountain lion, because I could hear a low rumbling sound like a cat purring but much louder. I decided to return to the motor home, as I turned to retrace my steps (I was probably 50 feet from the noise) this huge hulk stood up in front of me and made a loud screeching noise. It raised up to a full standing position, I would say 7 or 8 ft tall, dark brownish hair.  We looked at each other for a moment and then I turned and ran full speed away from him.  When I looked back to see if he was following me, he was walking in the opposite direction toward the deep forest. I stood and watched him until he disappeared in the deep woods. He did not walk like an animal but more like a man. When I composed myself, I went back to the area I saw him at to look for tracks, but all I found was crushed cat tails, an area of about 10 ft in dia was all smashed down, and it smelled like a strong urine smell in the area. I told the family what I saw and to this day they think I saw a deer or some other animal. I tell this story now to my grand children when we go camping.

Ive been meaning to submit this experience to BFRO for a while now but I wanted to find the right timeframe noted in my journal.  I had lost this journal but I recently moved and found it in a box while unpacking.  <BR><BR>I still remember it clearly, although I have never submitted it to any site such as this before. I am an avid backpacker and have backpacked extensively in the western states, in the wildest and remotest regions, and have encountered many large wild animals including grizzly bears. Never before nor since have I had such an odd experience as this one. <BR><BR>I left one Friday evening (August 1, 1986) by myself after work with my dogs (at the time my family had a beagle and a poodle, I''ll take anything hiking with me!), and I was trying to find a lake up in Tahoe National Forest called White Rock Lake. I had never been there before so I wasn''t familiar with the unmarked roads. According to the topo map I could get there via a 4-wheel drive road. <BR><BR>Way back behind Truckee, northeast of Fordyce Lake, I found myself driving slowly, at night, on rough rocky dirt roads, trying to figure out where I was. Roads would seem to peter out, or bisect with other 4-wheel drive roads, and I had no clue where I was going. I was way out in the middle of nowhere... no lakes or significant creeks or any destination type areas within miles. <BR><BR>I decided to wait until daylight before I confused myself anymore in the darkness. I''m sure I didn''t even need to pull off the little \"road\" I was on since I hadn''t seen anyone or anything, but just in case, I did. I pulled off the rocky road just a few yards, my Datsun 4-wheel drive pickup hidden by trees. I grabbed my sleeping bag, tossed it outside in front of my truck, and me and my dogs slept under a very starry night. <BR><BR>Sometime early in the morning, around 3 or 4 a.m. (it was still pitch black), I awoke and heard something walking up the road in my direction. I could tell it was heavy, and it was walking steadily my way. At first I thought it must''ve been a backpacker, as it was obviously bipedal by the rhythm of the walk. The steps were distinct. Then I thought to myself, what would a backpacker be doing way out here on this road, in the middle of the night, with no light, with nothing but miles of thick forest in all directions? I knew it wasn''t a bear (I''ve encountered dozens of bears in my years in the wild). I had no idea what this was, but a backpacker was still my best guess. <BR><BR>As it got closer and closer, I wondered if I should say something, but I didn''t want to scare anyone unnecessarily. I''m sure it would just walk right by. But, for some reason, I was getting increasingly nervous, and there aren''t too many things in the wilderness that make me nervous. The odd thing was my dogs weren''t making a sound, or a move for that matter, which added to the suspense. My dogs would have normally at least given a warning bark or two. This heavy, bipedal thing was coming closer and closer and was about to come to the point where I had pulled my truck off the road. I laid there very quietly. I didn''t know what to expect, and hoped whatever or whoever it was would just continue on by, not even noticing me. It was so dark I couldn''t see a thing. <BR><BR>The closer it got, the bigger I realized it must be, because through the rhythm of the walk I could tell it was quite large. I stayed silent in my nervousness. A sasquatch was the last thing on my mind as I hadn''t really given much thought in the past to such a thing, especially in the Sierras. That was about to change. It came up to where I had parked my truck off the road, and... silence. It stopped. Although I couldn''t see it in the darkness, it was only a few yards away from where I was laying in my sleeping bag. <BR><BR>I don''t know if I made a sound, or one of my dogs made a sound, but something happened that made it react. This thing let out the most heinous, forest-piercing scream you could imagine. I can''t even attempt to put in words what this thing sounded like. It had a set of lungs on it like nothing I could describe or accurately imitate. Then, still screaming, it turned around and ran back down the road in the darkness at a fast rate of speed. It screamed the whole time, echoing through the forest. It never let up. I could hear the screams fading in the distance.<BR><BR>I laid there in total shock. I couldn''t believe what just happened. Eventually I jumped up and tossed everything in my truck. My dogs acted just as freaked as me. I knew whatever it was a long distance away by this point, so before leaving the area I drove down the road with my brights on, trying to see if I could see any footprints or signs of anything odd. My adrenaline was flowing big time. Although I didn''t actually get out of the truck, I opened the door and looked down to see if I could see footprints or any clue of what this thing was. The road was too rocky for footprints. I then let my dogs out, hoping they would pick up a scent (although I didn''t know what I''d do if they did), but oddly they jumped right back in the truck. This was out of character for them. I tossed them back out again, and they jumped right back in. I decided if they''re as freaked out as I am, I better get the heck out of there and I drove many miles back towards the main road. <BR><BR>I hadn''t thought much of a sasquatch before this experience, but now I''m certainly a believer. People try and explain it away to me, but I know what I heard. I didn''t see it, nor did I smell anything, but it was so close I could feel it. And it was so close when it screamed that I''m surprised I didn''t get spit on. Nothing in those forests could scream like that, nor run that fast, especially nothing that walked upright. I don''t dwell on the bigfoot subject, nor have I made it a mission to seek them out, but I know theyre out there. My experience is still very vivid.

Within five minutes the silence was broken when we heard a howl in the distance, which sounded like it was coming from the granite formations, which over looked the resort. All of us froze. The sound scared us because we had never heard a sound like that before. The vocalization lasted under a minute. <BR><BR>We waited for another 10-15 minutes out on the deck to see if whatever made the howl would howl again. But it did not howl again so we went back inside and I took a shower.

It was overcast and very cold with a strong wind blowing. There was still snow on the surrounding peaks. Mono Lake is at the base of the Sierra Nevada mountains. <BR><BR>I do not recall the location at which we parked the car to begin our hike, but I do remember that ours was the only car in the parking area and that the spot was quite desolate. It was a cold Saturday morning and the area was deserted. At 9:17AM I began shooting VHS video footage of our trek, and after a short period of time we finally decided to leave because of the wind and cold. We went back to our hotel in June Lake, enjoyed the rest of the weekend and went home. The trip was quite uneventful (or so we assumed).<BR><BR>The tape went into our family home video collection and for 17 years, from 1991 to 2008, it has been watched countless times by family and friends. So much so that my kids have the dialog on much of the tape collection memorized. On April 19, 2008 my daughter (6 years old in the video and now 22) was watching the tape in the downstairs family room when she suddenly screamed out and began yelling for me to come downstairs. I thought something bad had happened and after racing down the staircase, found my daughter and my ex sitting in front of the television telling me to watch a segment from the tape. What I saw when we played it back made the hair stand up on the back of my neck. And it was something none of us had ever noticed in almost 17 years of watching this tape,<BR><BR>In the final few seconds of the Mono Lake segment just before I turned the camera off I caught something very large and black moving between two rock formations a short distance from where we had been hiking. It was completely black with no differentiation in color or texture and walked upright like a human but with a gate more like a primate. At first I thought it was a bear, but after going over the video many times and finally digitizing and sharpening it I am now unsure what to think. From examination of the footage of my family whose distance from the camera was comparable to that of the creature it is easy to see the distinct details and variation in clothing, hair, face and hands. In contrast, the creature caught on tape exhibits none of those distinctions.The shape of the body does not resemble a human. The head is too large and the arms are too long. And although it does resemble a bear at one particular angle in the clip, the stance and gate don''t add up. It is an intriguing mystery.<BR><BR>That we were able to go for 17 years without noticing this event on the tape seems unbelievable, but in retrospect it actually makes some sense. The segment lasts for only a couple of seconds and the focus is on the lake and mountains which is what I must have been filming at the time. I didn''t see it when I shot the tape and it has since gone unnoticed because one must really be looking for it to see it.<BR><BR>I am not a person who is prone to believing in conspiracy theories, alien abductions and bizarre events such as a purported Bigfoot sighting. I''ve seen various footage and photographs of Bigfoot/Sasquatch sightings over the years and have always been extremely skeptical of their authenticity. As an engineer who now teaches high school physics, I am highly educated and very level headed. If I see something I don''t understand my natural reaction is to analyze it rationally using the scientific method. I do not jump to conclusions based on faulty hypotheses. So in this case, I will suspend judgment pursuant to further investigation. But having shown this video to family and friends whose opinions I trust, the overall reaction seems to be a unanimous \"Bigfoot!!\" Wishful thinking? Maybe. Maybe not. Either way it is very intriguing and definitely warrants further investigation.<BR><BR>Your opinion and assistance in this matter would be appreciated.<BR>", :environment "Away from the lake, the area is arid, a dry desert like area with sparse grass, very rocky with small bushes, and no trees.

We would make sure to get there early so that we could sit in the car and wait for dawn to come. <BR><BR>Just as the sun would start to rise and there was enough light to see we would normally see tons of rabbits running about, but that day was different. There was not a single rabbit in sight. That had never happened before. We stayed in the truck and waited until the sun was fully up before we decided to get out and take a stroll around to see if there was anything to see. Just before we left the truck my dad asked me if I wanted to bring the camera and I told him \"Na, we arent going to see anything out here.\" Ha-ha! Boy was I mistaken. <BR><BR>We took off from the truck and went into the wilderness. There was nothing to see at all. No animals anywhere. We were walking along and suddenly we came upon the giant footprints in the sand. There were two sets of prints, one right next to the other. They were barefoot and looked just like human feet. Right away we knew what they were. Its a natural thing that goes through your mind. When you see them you say yourself, \"Those are bigfoot tracks.\" <BR><BR>The first sets of tracks were HUGE, and thee times as big as my fathers feet, and he is about 6'' 3\" with a good sized foot. (He is very thin though). The second set of footprints was the same size as mine. Right next to its parents tracks. The tracks dug deep into the ground and my father and I talked about that. We tried to stomp on the ground to see if we make an indention as deep as theirs but we couldnt, even with our shoes on. <BR><BR>We followed the tracks and we came to a barbwire fence. On the other side was a paved road. On the other side of the road was a hill that went up and overlooked a valley. I was too young to notice anything about how the tracks crossed the fence and got to the road or if there was a piece of fur on the barbs, so Im sorry that I couldnt tell you anymore about that. On the other side of the road there were no tracks and we couldnt find any more around. <BR><BR>My father decided that we needed the camera, so I stayed at the fence while he went back the way we came to get back to the truck. It seemed like it took forever for him to return and being a little kid I was getting a little scared. But, he finally came back and told me that he could not find the truck! So when we were done looking around we took the road that we had found to see where it would lead us. It took us to a small town that we had passed to get to our spot.

I observed it for about 3 to 4 strides. It was all black, long arms (longer than ours), tall, muscular, and slim with no neck visible. It must of been at least 7 to 8 ft. tall and weighing about 400 to 500 lbs. I reached for my camera and that is when I saw it cross back over the road again this time in a slow more human like gait like it was trying to elude something without illiciting a chase response from whatever it was trying to elude like you might do if you saw a growling dog.

We arrived at the lakes at appx. 11 a.m. and fished until 2:30 p.m., at which time we decided to head back down the trail for home.  There were quite a few hikers in the area over the course of the day, appx. 13 hikers and a pack train consisting of 4 riders and 8 horses and a dog. Some coming in, some going out.  Anyway, we headed down the trail following the pack train.  We stopped on the way down to read the sign about the wagons that tried to use that trail way back in the day. I heard a noise like some one else coming down the trail behind us and told my family let''s get going.  The trail was pretty dry and dusty and my husband kept insisting that we give the hikers ahead of us some time so we could avoid walking in their dust. The next section of trail was slightly up hill so after cresting the top and going a short distance down the other side we stopped for a water break.  We heard what we thought was a shout, my son shouted back and something answered, but the echo was pretty bad, so we couldn''t make out what was being said.  We continued on down the trail and had just approached the south end of Leavitt Meadows, when my husband says \"What is that?\"  Both my son and I stopped and looked across the river toward the meadow.  From the beginning it was a strange sight, because this large black thing appeared to be floating across the meadow.  At first I thought it was a backpacker perhaps riding a bike, because it was moving so quickly across the meadow. It was moving quickly and smoothly.  It didn''t make sense.  If it was a back packer, to be moving that fast, he would have to be running and running with a back pack is anything but smooth; if he was riding a bike, then why couldn''t I see the bike and its arms and legs were in line with its body, not bent at an angle like it was sitting on something.  Also the color, I couldn''t figure out why a backpacker would be wearing black, black cap, black backpack, black pants, black coat.  It was at least 80-85 degrees.  We stood and watched silently for a time, perhaps 10-15 seconds.  The speed and smoothness with which it traveled was mesmerising.  Then my husband and son took off running further up the trail to another vantage point; they continued to watch it silently, then just shortly after I caught up to them, my son yelled, and the thing stopped and turned toward us.  It didn''t turn as a human would turn, even one wearing a backpack.  Then it began moving across the meadow again.  Not faster or slower, just the same floating type pace. <BR>We were on the trail above the meadow, looking down and appx. 500-800 yards a way from the object.  My husband believes the thing was following the pack trail. We left the trail and went down to the meadow.  We stayed on the trail side of the river.  The thing was on the opposite side of the river.  By this time it was gone or hidden from us.  The best way to describe it is like this.  The thing had a head that sat directly on its shoulders.  It did not appear to have a neck.  That is why we at first thought it was a backpacker.  It went head, broad shoulders or backpack, no neck, large body.  We could not discern its legs or arms due mostly to the angle at which it was leaving us. The grass in the Meadow obscured some of the legs. We have spent many hours in the woods, my husband was raised in Plumas county, neither he nor I have ever ever seen anything like this.  It could not have been a bear, they can''t walk that far on 2 legs, nor that smoothly or quickly.  ", :environment "Trail runs between ridge line and river.

It was late July of 1977. My family was up in the eastern Sierras, near Mono Lake, approx 13-15 miles above Conway Summit in an area known as Virginia Lakes. My dad told my brother and I to go to the lake and gather firewood. It was late in the day and the sun was down but it wasn''t dark yet, only dusk. I was 14 yrs old and my brother was 1 month shy of 16. He had his learners permit so we were allowed to take the truck.<BR>We got to the lake and started loading up some wood. I had just returned to the truck and dropped the wood when I heard, what I thought, was someone walking through the brush. The foot falls were very heavy, almost like someone was jumping, but the steps seemed pretty rapidly placed. Where we were gathering wood was near a large hedge of bushes, approx 6 to 7 feet high and very dense with only 1 path through the bush to skirt the lake without wading in the water. I turned to the bushes, where the sound was coming from, and saw the bushes shaking and bending, as if something large was moving through the bushes, making a lot of noise. I watched for a few seconds when my brother came running to the truck, white as a ghost and eyes bulging wide.<BR>I said,\"Jeff, what was that?\"<BR>He was scared and out of breath. \"I don''t know, but let''s get out of here.\" he said.<BR>We jumped back into the truck and drove all out. On the way back to the camp, he told me that he was only 10 or 15 feet away from it. He heard the stomping and crashing of the brush, and turned to see a large, dark-brown head above the bushes moving rapidly away from him. He didn''t see the face. <BR>He was so scared, he crashed the truck into a tree on the way back to camp. My dad was pretty pissed, to say the least, and didn''t believe our story, even when we were crying because of how frightened we were. He finally calmed down and said that we probably saw a bear. But, bears do not walk through heavy brush on 2 legs. And my brother swore that it was not a bear. I think my dad started to believe that we saw something since we both would not go out to the camp fire that night, and both of us refused to go to the lake alone for the rest of the trip.<BR>Since that time, I have told several people with very few people actually believing me. Most told me that big foot are only in the north-west in Oregan/Washington. But, after finding this website, I feel a bit vindicated.

I left my home in Manhattan Beach, California about 8:00 AM on the morning of February 16th after one last unsuccessful attempt to persuade my son to join me for a long weekend of wild pig hunting.  Monday was Presidents Day, my son was off school, and the Fort was open for hunting.  But 16-year old boys have other interests.  I arrived at the Fort about 12:30 PM alone, checked into Training Area 10/13 to hunt, and stopped at the Hacienda for lunch and to claim my room for the weekend.  After changing to camouflage clothing and hunting boots I headed up Sulfur Springs Road to where Training Area 10/13 begins.<BR><BR>About 4:30 PM I stopped to look at a creek that crosses under Sulfur Spring Road near Lyons Pond in Area 7 as I drove Northeast.  I learned of the creek that is often used as a wallowing spot, on a guided hunt in 1999.  From the road I could see much recent activity.  It appeared as though quite a few pigs had been wallowing in the small creek the night before.  I drove on about 150 yards and parked my Bronco along Sulfur Spring Road.  <BR><BR>I climbed down the 20-foot high embankment to the creek to check the area more carefully.  There were very fresh wallows all along the creek with many fresh droppings in addition. I walked on to Lyons Pond, which was dry, and returned to Sulfur Springs Road.  All of the fresh sign was in Area 7 at the edge of the road, but I was registered to hunt in Area 10/13on the other side of the road.  This is an important distinction at Hunter Liggett.  If you are caught with a loaded gun in an Area you are not registered to hunt, you are banned from the Fortforever.<BR><BR>I solved this conflict by noticing that the pigs appeared to be using a large culvert to cross under the road from Area 10/13 to Area 7.  I decided that I would wait for their return on the 10/13 side of the road.  I positioned myself about 10 yards off, and 20 feet below the road.  My hope was that the pigs would be traveling up the creek through Area 10/13 to Area 7 just after the sun set.  It was about 5:00 PM when I took my position with determination to not move until 30 minutes after sunset.  <BR><BR>The first hour of waiting was pretty boring.  Nothing was moving and the forest was eerily quite.  About an hour before sunset the woods began to show signs of life.  A few Blue Jays and Woodpeckers flew by and a few frog croaks resonated from the small creek I was watching.  Closer to sunset I noticed two does moving through the woods and squirrels scampering about.  I knew that if the pigs returned to the creek it would be in those magical 30 minutes after sunset and that time was just arriving!  <BR><BR>Much to my disappointment, a blue Ford Ranger also arrived as the sunset.  Two hunters climbed out, grabbed their rifles and walked down a small, grassy road that entered the woods about 75 feet from where I was sitting.  I watched them pass and disappear on the road that was slightly above my hidden sitting position.  My hopes of a pig encounter of the close kind were dashed.  I was certain these hunters would either intercept my prey or scare them away with their movement and noise.  <BR><BR>I was heartened a few minutes latter as I saw both hunters returning along the road to their truck.  I watched them carefully with my new Swarovski binocular.  It was about 10 minutes after sunset and without the binocular they appeared as shadows in the darkening forest.  With my Swarovski binocular I could see details of the weaving in the plaid hunting jacket one was wearing and the rifles they were carrying.  They climbed into their truck and drove offleaving me with 15 more minutes of wild pig hope.<BR><BR>These minutes passed slowly as I glassed the forest in search of movement.  The frogs in the creek began a loud chorus that added to the excitement.  There was lots of movement but no signs of pigs.  Chipmunks and squirrels were scampering about and I saw a coyote moving in the distance.  Drizzle started to fall, along with my hopes, as the last few minutes of hunting time expired.  I resolved to return to the same spot in the morning as I put the lens covers on my binocular and gather up my backpack and rifle.<BR><BR>But before I could stand up I saw a flash of light color a few 100 yards back into the forest.  I had no idea what I had seen out of the corner of my eye.  The color was white or silver-gray, not a color that I would expect to see on a wild pig.  I looked off into that direction for a few seconds before seeing another brief flash of the same light colored object.  Both confused and intrigued I watched as repeated flashes of white or silver-gray coloring appeared in the forest.  Whatever it was appeared to be moving and after about 20 seconds of watching I realized that it was moving in my direction along the same road the two hunters had walked earlier.<BR><BR>I believed I watched this creature move through the forest for about two or three minutes before I finally got a clear, unobstructed view of it against a light sky background.  My attitude was relaxed but attentive as I tried to figure out what I was seeing.  Patches of silver-gray flashed through openings in the forest, sometimes high, sometimes low!  My attitude changed to surprise and fright as I saw it take 4 or 5 full steps in a 30-foot clearing along the raised road, 75 feet from where I was sitting.  I was wide-awake, completely sober, free from any medications, and completely focused on this approaching object.  I was alone, watching with my naked eyes, and heavily armed.  I had a Model 70 in 300 Winchester magnum in my hands and was carrying a Tarus Raging Bull in 454 Casull on my belt.  <BR><BR>What the hell was it?  <BR><BR>I dont know!  <BR><BR>It was walking completely upright on two legs.  <BR><BR>It was very large.  I estimate that it was 8 feet tall and weighed 800 lbs.  Not 30 minutes before I had watched two hunters cross the same 30-foot opening and had thought how small they looked.  In contrast, I was surprised at how big this creature was.<BR><BR>It was covered with silver-gray hair from its very pointed head to its feet.  The only difference in coloration was a dark facial mask and similar colored palmsbrown or black.<BR><BR>I saw this creature in side profile and could make out few facial features.  What I could see appeared very flat, with little nose or chin protruding.  The silver-gray hair on the head rose about 8 from the top of the facial mask to a pronounced point at the top of the skull.  The head blended into the body without any visible neck in between.<BR><BR>The silver-gray hair on the arms was about 4 inches long.  I could see this clearly as these very long, heavily muscled arms swung in cadence with its fast, uninterrupted, strides.  Bulging back and shoulder muscles flexed visibly under the hair as it strode along the road.<BR><BR>It was not carrying nor wearing anything.  Both hands were empty.  There were no shoes, belt, pack or anything else that would suggest cultural development or advanced intelligence.<BR><BR>Four long, powerful strides in a clear opening against the still light Western sky and it was gone!  <BR><BR>I was dumbfounded!  What the hell had I just seen?  It took me about 10 seconds to grab my backpack and start running up the 10 grade to Sulfur Spring Road to get another look.  I slipped to one knee as I scrambled up the hill and pulled my Raging Bull out of its holster as I reached the road.  My heart was racing and my hands were trembling but it wasnt from the runningI was pretty damn scared!<BR><BR>It was 40 minutes past sunset, but I was looking West toward an open field on the other side of the road, the direction in which this creature was headed.  There was nothing movingI couldnt see or hear any sign of what I had just seen.  I walked slowly down the center of the Sulfur Spring Road toward the point where the other road connected.  I called out a number of times to see if anyone or anything would respond.  Nothing did.  After a few minutes I slowly walked backward down the center of Sulfur Spring Road toward my Bronco that was parked about 200 yards East of where I had been hunting.<BR><BR>I jumped in and locked the doors!  I turned it around and slowly drove back toward the Hacienda with the bright lights searching for any signs of movement along the road.  The drizzle turned to serious rain as I reached the Hacienda.  I went directly to the restaurant for dinner and a few glasses of wine.  I chatted with two other hunters seated at the same table.  We exchanged stories of seeing deer and fresh pig sign in the areas we had hunted.  They told me of seeing a flock of wild turkeys run across their path in Area 7, not far from the Hacienda.  I didnt say a word about what I had just seen.  I was sure they would think I was nuts.   I was sure because I was beginning to wonder myself!<BR><BR>It rained hard all night.  <BR><BR>A heavy rain continued until about 11:00 AM Sunday morning.  <BR><BR>I left the Hacienda an hour before sunrise on February 17th headed back to the spot where I had seen this unbelievable creature.  I parked in the same spot as the day before, and loaded my rifle and pistol before I unlocked the door as the sky began to gray in the East.  I watched the creek for pigs until about 30 minutes after sunrise, then began looking for footprints along the small road where I had seen what appeared to be a silver-gray Sasquatch.<BR><BR>The road was covered with grass and extended only about 200 yards from Sulfur Spring Road to where it dead-ended at a small ravine. There were few patches of bare dirt and no tracks.  Either the grassy road didnt show tracks or the rain had washed them away. Or, perhaps, there had been nothing to leave tracks in the first placeonly an over active imagination!<BR><BR>From the end of the road I slowly still-hunted toward an adjacent ridge.  It was a few hundred feet above the surrounding ground and offered a good vantage point to glass for movement.  While I kept my eyes open for pigs, I was really looking for something silver-gray.  I saw neither.  At noon, I returned to Sulfur Spring Road and walked back into Area 7.  Lyons pond had little new water in it despite the heavy rain over the last 18 hours.  There were few pig and deer tracks on the bare dirt as the heavy rain had washed most of the tracks away.  I saw no sign of any tracks that might have been left by the beast I saw the night before.  <BR>", :environment "The immediate area is a low lying wooded area along a small creek.

I was working for the US Forest Service on the Monterey Ranger District (Arroyo Seco Station). One the first things we had to do before the day began was go on a 2-mile fitness run. I dont remember the specific day. I began my run about 8:30 am about 3/4 of the way through the run I began to fall behind the crew. I came to area known as the Abbott lakes area. I stopped to catch my breath. I then heard a noise off to my left on the hillside. The hillside was covered with oak trees, poison oak and thick brush.  The side of the hill was shaded from the sun so I had really looked hard to see what was hearing. I noticed what appeared to a man walking up the hill about 20 feet in front of me. I then realized that this was to tall and to wide to be a person. It was about 8 feet tall. It stopped, turned its head and stared back at me for about 30 seconds. When it turned the whole upper body turned with head. I could not see its face because of the shade. It turned and walked up the hill. I ran back to the station knowing what I seen was not human.  Later that day I was with my supervisor alone and I asked him if he ever seen anything weird near the lakes or the bone yard (trash area). He looked at me and said \"oh you seen it to\" he later went on to tell that other members of forest service seen it to. He states that the season prior that one employee said he seen close up and it was covered with hair. I just blew it off. A month later I was placed on the night shift with one other person.  One of the things was to check the bone yard area for campers. One evening we drove into the bone yard and about 30 feet in front of us was a dark, 8-foot thing walking away from our vehicle.  I did not say anything to my partner until we drove out of the area. She turned to me and said, \"Did you see that?\" I then asked her what the hell is it. She told me she had seen several times in past.  That was the last time I seen it that season.<BR><BR>The 1995 fire season came around and due to budget problems only 3 people were on for the season. This made me nervous because this meant I would work alone 3 days a week. I avoided the bone yard area at all cost when I worked alone.  Halfway though the season a coworker and myself drove into the bone yard area to pick a picnic table.  My partner had a bad habit of wanting to catch a wild turkey for pet so as we drove up he took off running after a turkey that was about 40 feet from our truck. I did not see the turkey once I got off the truck but ran in the direction that my partner was running in.  As I got closer I realized that this was not a turkey we were chasing. As I got a better look at it I realized what I was looking at I only seen the upper body of it because it was walking down a slope. It had turtle shaped head and what appeared to be long tail coming from it. It moved at very fast pace away from us. I backed off, as did my partner.  I took notice of noise that it made as it walked away. I lost sight of it but I could still hear it running through the brush. That was my last season at this station.

We went to an area that had a little lake with an un-improved campground. My parents went up there that Friday morning and we went after work as Brian and I worked at the same place. We picked up Steve on the way out there. We got to the lake at around 9pm Friday night, and after setting up our camp, we sat and talked half the night. The camp was on the north end of the lake. There was a marsh area that had very thick underbrush to the immediate west of our camp. This marsh area extended to almost the southwest of the lake. If you picture a clock, the marsh area would be from the 8''0 clock to the 12''0 clock position. <BR><BR>After spending all day Saturday fishing with my folks and having a great time, we all settled down and relaxed at the camp. We had dinner and built a campfire and we all stared into the fire telling stories until my folks went to bed. At around midnight, Steve, Brian and I were sitting around the fire when I thought I heard something in the marsh area. It sounded like something walking through there. Steve didn''t hear it and I just dismissed it at first. But Brian and I kept hearing it. It soundedd like something going back and forth like it was pacing the camp. I knew no one was camped in that area, so I just thought it was an animal. This went on for about an hour and a half. I even jokeed to Steve that the tent he and Brian were sleeping in was just giftwrap to a bear if one came after them and I''d sleep really good in the back of my truck.<BR><BR>The next morning my folks decided to go home early. My friends and I decided to stay there a couple more days because Brian and I didn''t have to go to work until the following Thursday. By two that afternoon, we pretty much had the whole lake all to ourselves except for a couple of other groups of campers. At 2:30 Sunday afternoon, the three of us piled into my truck to hunt for firewood. We took a dirt road that went east to west along a ridge directly off of the lake''s entrance road about 1/8th mile from our camp. We were following this road in a pretty thick patch of woods for about a mile when it suddenly opened up into a meadow about 300 meters below the ridgeline of the hill we were on. There was another patch of woods to our south that paralleled the road for about 2 or 3 miles. I stopped the truck because we saw a ton of good firewood. <BR><BR>Brian and Steve went in a southeast direction away from the front of the truck while I grabbed my axe and headed in a northern direction towards some logs so we could get some \"all night burners\". I got about 30 ft from the truck when I saw it.<BR><BR>At first I didn''t know what I was seeing. It was a hairy thing sitting down against a tree with it''s back towards me. It was in the treeline we had just come out of. It was only 60 yards from me at most. I stood there frozen because I thought it might be a bear and I only had an axe and I didn''t feel like being any kind of hero. After maybe 5 seconds, it stood up on 2 legs. It looked massive, like 8 to 8 1/2 foot tall and at least 3 1/2 to 4 feet wide. It had reddish-brown hair all over it and it matched the color of the bark on the trees perfectly. It had huge hands that came down to just above it''s knees. It grabbed onto the trees just to guide itself through them, not push them aside. There were some pretty good sized trees in that patch of woods and they looked small when this thing grabbed them. It walked away from me towards the crest of the hill and I was amazed at how smoothly it moved. <BR><BR>It was weaving in and out of the trees stealthily and it never made a sound, not a grunt, not a wheeze, nothing. I didn''t even hear footsteps. As it got near the top of the hill, it stopped and looked down into the next valley to the North and it just walked on over the hill never even looking back at me. I couldn''t see it''s face. I didn''t see a neck either, just it''s head set kinda on top of it''s shoulders. <BR><BR>I stood there for about 10 seconds when I got the nerve up to get the hell out of there. I backed down the hill to the truck and I noticed that Brian and Steve were still gathering wood. I joined up with them after I got a soda from the truck and I calmed down. I gathered some wood with them and we got out of there. They never saw it. We stayed there another couple of nights, but we didn''t have another incident for the whole trip. I didn''t tell them what I saw because they wouldn''t have believed it.

Well, as time went on, we heard  the noise move down the hill and down the side of the mountain, which is extremely hard to traverse. My dad and I kept speculating as to what it was, as he had hunted bear, deer, and elk, and could not place what it was. We thought, from the tone, that it could have been a lost animal, as it had a mournful tone to it. It had a very resonant quality to it, like it was a good sized animal. Anyway, the noise seemed to move along the side of us, and then we would hear it back at its original location rather quickly.

We walked up the hill, (on the dirt road), maybe 50 yards and saw nothing; when we got back to camp, I jumped in my truck and drove up the hill maybe 3-400 yards and saw nothing; I did not get out of my truck to look around as I was highly agitated (read:pretty dang spooked) I turned around and kept flashing my spotlight down the side of the mountain occasionally and went past camp down the hill on to Foresthill Road and drove up the road a little ways before turning around again and heading to camp. My dad and brother reported that they had heard nothing and it was quiet for awhile. I sat around the fire and watched the tv that my dad had brought with him; my brother was tired and had gone to bed fairly early. Everything seemed fairly quiet until I went to go \"number one\" by a big pine tree across the road and as I was juggling with the belt that was holding my pistol in its holster, I heard that noise behind the tree and it seemed like it was maybe 30 yards down the hill, it startled me, to say the least, and I ran back to the relative safety of the campfire holding up my pants with one hand and my pistol with the other, much to my dads amusement. Needless to say, I did not venture from camp the rest of the night. We continued to hear the noises until we went to bed, around 0330 or so, I remember hearing it around 0345 and yelling to my dad (he slept in the back of his camper, my brother and I in my tent, 15 ft away) \"there it is again!\", but he was sleepy. I finally drifted off to sleep shortly thereafter and no noise was heard again.<BR>THE \"NOISE\": Resonant. Very similar to the \"Howl\" on your website, but of a shorter duration, 2-3 seconds or so each time. <BR>A note about my father and brother: my brother was very tired from working the night before and he drank quite a bit of beer on this evening; he may have also thought that I was trying to \"spook\" him as he does not go camping much. He was disinterested and does not remember much.<BR>My fathers curiosity was piqued, but he was not agitated or spooked like I was; his philosophy is that humans are the most dangerous creatures out in the forest,and this was an animal, though he was not sure what it was and still doesnt. Also, he states that I heard brush or sticks being broken, but I cant recall stating that. I would not have even wrote this in until I had read the reports from the Tahoe area, which described such a similar noise, and is only about 60-70 miles as the crow flies from there. <BR>", :environment "pine forest, Manzanita, fairly rugged beautiful country.

It was back in 1998, the second weekend of September (I know this because we always meet on the second weekend of the month).

When I got up there, my unit commander was already there, so after we got done, we bedded down for the night.<BR><BR>Before you knew it, it was morning and all through the night we kept hearing cars and trucks pulling up. The next morning we woke up to everyone there (all four units worth).  All that day, we battled from dawn until dusk.  When we were done, all tired and bruised, we managed to drag ourselves back to camp for dinner.  Some went into town, the rest of us stayed and had it there. Later, we were all back and sitting around four different fires and talking about the day.  One by one we went back to our tents or cots and sleeping bags.  The last thing I remember before I went to sleep was both of the commanders talking about tomorrow''s set up and that was it, or so I thought.<BR><BR>Well, I was rolling over in my cot and slightly awake when, well for the lack of a better word, heard a \"howling sound\".  I, in all my life, have never heared anything like it before. It cried out eight or nine times . After a few moments there was nothing, so I got tired and went back to sleep, but only because the sound wasn''t too close to the camp.  It sounded like it came from where we where battling that day up on the ridge, about half a mile from us.<BR><BR>I woke up again about one hour later. I had to use the bathroom, I put on my boots and walked over to a bush to relieve myself, and on the way back I heard it again, but this time it was much closer.  It was right down the road from us and it was loud, very loud, and I know that this time I wasn''t the only one to hear it.   Several times it let out . one after another.  This time it was much more deep and clear to the ear. My unit commander and several of the other unit people woke up. To my and their knowledge, we didn''t know what to do . No matter what I did, I could not stay awake but before I went back to sleep, I loaded my gun with real bullets and put my bayonet under my blanket near my pillow. What ever it was, if it came into camp and hurt me or anyone, I was going to kill it.  We heard it two more times that night, each time it was further away. <BR><BR>When we woke up that next morning, many people were confused and in denial about what happened.

But make no mistake, once we all shut up, and we did, we all heard this. It even repeated like the screams in the recording.<BR><BR>Someone suggested perhaps a coyote. No way, Mark and I are experienced woodsmen, and I have been inches away from bears while backpacking in Yosemite and have coyote''s where I live!  I know what a wolf sounds like. This was not even close to those sounds. Also noted, as soon as Mark originally told me to shut up and listen, we both verified the sound as being the one in the recording at the same time!!!  It was that unmistakeable. We have listened to numerous recordings and the one stated above is the only one that sounded like the calls, screams we heard that night. Also noted, the noise changed briefly on one call and sounded (don''t laugh) like someone strangling a cat.<BR><BR>Also noted, it almost seemed like it heard us because the sound would stop and someone would make a joke and we would laugh and then we would hear it immediately after making noise.  Also noted, could not judge distance but it seemed like it was a couple of miles away (just a guess). Also noted, the sound came from above the basin where we were. We had taken a 12-gauge [shotgun] out, and fired it twice after this went on for a few minutes. Heard no more sounds after this. We do not hunt animals (we do not believe in shooting animals) we target-shoot and go skeet-shooting.

I did not even think about it at the time and it was too damn cold to even want to get out of my tent. No prints, smell, or any sighting was observed. I asked if anyone was out at the time and the answer was no. Also noted, I was pretty shaken after hearing this unnerving sound. I pretty much stayed by the fire the rest of the night. Looked often into the darkeness but saw nothing. No other animal sound was reported the rest of the night.<BR><BR>After I got home I played the sound to the rest of our camp group, they all verified that it \"sure did sound like what we heard.\" Although, some of the guys had trouble digesting this.

It looked exactly like the many drawings they''d seen of Bigfoot. They doubt this was someone dressed in a Gorilla costume.

This was not wildlife; this was CLEARLY a bipedal footfall. <BR><BR>By the time most of my work was done. I was getting a little spooked and I just wanted to get back up to the landing where my truck was parked. Unfortunately, I never got eyes on it so I cant give you a visual account.  I was only able to occasionally see saplings move. To be perfectly honest I was too afraid to look. I had my head down humping gear up the trail, I was light and moving at good clip on a trail. This thing was EASILY able to outpace me even though it was working through steep rocky brush and tree covered terrain. At times it got ahead of me because of the contour of the land and that was a little bit horrifying. This thing was agile and fast. This went on for a couple of hours.<BR><BR>About a half hour from my truck I stopped hearing anything. I feel I was being escorted out of the area. The whole experience was very unnerving. What bothers me the most is I dont know how long I was being watched. I was running chain saw intermittently with ear plugs in. Im sure the three of us were being watched on the previous trip. We just couldnt hear anything with the saws running.  <BR><BR>Ive spent a lot of time in the woods and still do in a professional capacity.

My wife and I shared a campsite and our friends shared a campsite, with 2 tents, on a second campsite about 50ft. away from us. I had drank no alcohol before going to bed so I slept fairly lightly.<BR><BR>I awoke at 4:50am. Just as I awoke, I heard a loud sound that seemed to me to be someone hitting a treetrunk with a large branch. I lifted my head in the tent and looked around for any light sources and saw none. I also heard no voices. I was intrigued enough to continue listening. Our closest neighbor had a Dachsund and the next closest had two larger dogs that were tied up outside their tent. Once I heard the first loud sound the outside dogs started moving around but didn''t bark. They made some moaning sounds but that''s all.<BR><BR>From what I could tell, as far as sounds, something or someone walked through the campground from lower to higher through a ravine. It had very heavy footsteps. It sounded like it broke fairly large branches on the ground. Once it crossed the campground''s asphalt, the neighboring dogs started crying, whimpering and moaning. I then heard what sounded like a rock or something similar, being thrown against a tree near our tent and falling to the ground. Right at the crescendo of the crunching branches I decided to get up and unzip our tent window and at the same time the tent of the owners of the dogs opened and a woman came out and grabbed the dogs to quiet them down. That was the last I heard of the crunching, footstep sounds. Also, there had been crickets making noise all night until this event. Once this started, the cricket noise reduced to only crickets at a great distance. By the end of the incident there were no forest sounds at all.<BR><BR>The next morning, we walked over to the ravine that I thought I had heard the biped walking through and found no footprints due to the extremely dry ground. I spoke to a family right next to the ravine and they had heard nothing that night but had heard footsteps the night before. The husband/father is a hunter and told me that he had seen bears 2 or 3 times in the past in those mountains but had never seen them down in the campgrounds in that area.<BR><BR>Mountain lions are fairly common in those mountains, but what I heard seemed to be heavier than a mountain lion.

We arrived at the lake at about 11pm and sat on the car next to some big green trash bins about 150 feet or so from the lake; when we heard something 400 feet or so breaking branches in a canyon to our backs. It sounded big and didn''t seem to care if it was heard coming down the slope, so I assumed it was just a big black bear until the smell. The only way I could describe it was a dying wet dog. <BR><BR>A feeling of discomfort came over us both as we saw nor heard any more of what we assumed to be a big black bear coming down the canyon, meaning whatever came down the canyon was hiding in the tree line 300 feet or so away from where we sat. I got a chill up my spine and had that feeling that we shouldn''t be here right now. We got in the car and left to come back just under a hour later hoping what ever it was would be gone, so we could try to finally go on our late night lake walk. <BR><BR>We pulled up and backed into to the same spot as before to notice that one of the green trash bins had been pushed over towards the lake, and that there was a 2 foot wide 4 inch deep circular dent like something big had punched it. There was no paint smear like a car had hit it. It was and had been dead quite other than the unknown thing that came down the canyon about an hour before. <BR><BR>I had no idea what could have done that to a big steel trash bin and for years until Google Earth Mapping of Bigfoot.

San Jacinto, specifically Round Valley. This was the third year we had done this and the plan was to spent the night at 9200 feet and do the peak the next day. Spend another night in Round Valley and go back down the mountain the third day. The place we set camp was on the south east side of Round Valley with some large granite boulders to give us some shelter if the wind picked up. Surrounding our camp were ponderosa and jeffrey pines and not too far away was a small stream. This was early June and there were still some snow drifts in the shaded places.<BR>    My son and I had eaten dinner and were getting ready for bed. At about 10:00 p.m. we were in our sleeping bags, but still talking and planning the trip to the peak in the morning. Suddenly without warning we heard a loud, low pitched whooping call in the boulders just above us. The hair on the back of my neck stood up and my son asked me if that was a monkey and I, not wanting to deal with a panicked 7 year old, told him it was just an owl. We did not smell anything or hear footsteps. Everything calmed down and we finally fell asleep. About an hour later I heard a load boom that sounded close to the tent. I looked out the window in the tent and saw a few clouds in the moonlight so I pulled our boots into the tent in case we got a thunderstorm in the night.<BR>    The next morning we got up and had breakfast, then headed for the peak. We made the peak but by the time we got back to camp my knees were swollen and sore so I put some snow in a sandwich bag for a cold pack that evening to reduce the swelling for the trip out the next morning. That night was uneventful and we slept well in the high altitude air. The next morning we got up and began to pack up for our trip off the mountain. I went up on top of the boulders to make sure none of our trash had blown away from camp and make sure everything was picked up. I then saw what had made that load boom the night before last. 30 yards from our tent on top of those boulders was an 8 inch diameter ponderosa pine snapped off at the base. The tree was still green and fresh and had no rot in it and there was no wind to speak of either night. The only explanation I can come up with is that the animal that made that whooping sound had pushed the tree over. The tree was not aimed in the direction of our tent but rather parallel the direction our tent was pitched.

I used to live in Orange County California, and an old girlfriend of mine and I, were camping up in Dutchman&#8217;s Flats area, near Idyllwild. We were out-packing, not in a campground.<BR><BR>We were awakened by screams that resembled the sound of a pack of coyotes that had just made a kill right outside of our tent. The screams however had a bit of a deeper tone than a coyote. At the time that is what we thought it was, so we stayed quiet not wanting to interrupt a wild animals meal. The screams and screeches continued for what seemed like an hour, but was probably about 5 or 10 minutes. The screams stopped, but we could hear what sounded like heavy footsteps right outside the door to our tent. We could hear sniffing sounds, and heavy breathing sounds.

But there was no sign of a coyote kill, like no blood or fur laying around. What I did see was a pair of big deep footprints going away from our site down into a deeply wooded ravine. The thing, what ever it was, walked upright, and had a 3 to 4 foot gait.  I followed the steps for a few yards down into the ravine while my girlfriend watched. It was still deathly quiet and I had a very eerie feeling that I was being watched. The footprints led right into a thicket and I could see it was a wide path left by whatever it was.

They came and investigated and now I have a live video feed coming from two spots near the creek.<BR><BR>The second time I saw it was at around one- thirty in the morning a few weeks later. I noticed the apple tree in the far corner of my yard going berserk. The big branches were really shaking hard. I had a night vision scope so I took it outside and looked through it but the tree settled down and I did not see anything so I sat the scope down. When I looked back over there I saw a human form from mid upper arm up walking towards the creek at the edge of the berry bushes. The bushes are around six plus feet tall, and this thing was perhaps two feet taller. I saw large rounded head on very large rounded, thick shoulders. It seemed to have very little neck. I could see that it was hairy and got quite a good view because it was silhouetted by a light on my neighbors porch.<BR><BR>My daughter was staying in a tent out in the yard a few nights later and was awakened by some whistling and then by something hitting her tent. Like something had been thrown.<BR><BR>There has been a print found on my property also. It is around 19 inches long and about 8 inches wide. I have never seen anything like it, but it looks like a giant human footprint to me.<BR><BR>These incidences are ongoing. I think this thing summers here. What do you think? Also, do you have any suggestions on your experience as to how I may be able to study it or observe it here?<BR>I would be delighted at any input. <BR><BR>Excerpts from Report # 12910                                           October 27, 2005<BR>OBSERVED: I have new possible evidence on the hill behind my house that I and a few friends of mine have found, and we desperately want someone more qualified to look at what we have here. I would appreciate talking to someone ASAP so that I can connect with you for a possible story.<BR><BR>For two years I have heard a whistle and chuffing sounds coming from the berries bushes in my yard. I thought it was some lost big tropical bird. I would call back to it, and it would call back, and so forth. I have had some bad odor incidences including one that woke me up from a dead sleep and gagged me.<BR><BR>A volunteer found a footprint up the hill behind my house and some friends of mine, [T. C.] and [N. M.] found additional footprints and hand prints in an area up the hill from my house that appears to be some form of crude camp. I have been there three times now and the second time I went there I observed that some 4-5 inches around 4-5 ft. long branches have been brought from some where other than that location and laid in a sort of rectangle fashion around a depression in the earth. There are more of these depressions without branch borders in the area. <BR><BR>There are snapped trees at @ the 10 ft. level; there are \"huts\", for a lack of a better term made from big branches. Some look older and some look recently made. There are also snapped trees and tracks that seem to form a path from this site down the hill towards my house. [N. M.] Found two pretty fresh handprints that appear to be coming out from one of the \"huts\". The finger tips are spread much farther a part than a human could have done. We found three separate footprints there that did not seem to be very old, maybe a couple of weeks, but no more.<BR><BR>I saw the Bigfoot three times now, once at 4 AM in the morning, and twice at 1 AM in the morning. It was very dark each time except once it walked in front of a light and I got a good look at its height and silhouette.<BR><BR>Excerpters from Report # 20720:                                        August 09, 2007 <BR>It was four thirty in the morning as I opened the sliding glass door to my trailer looking east towards my yard and I Creek; I thought to myself, that''s the biggest bear that I have ever seen. As it stood up from the blackberries in my yard it was eating, I saw two long arms and two very long legs. It began to run north towards the path I have that goes thru the berries to the creek, and I said to myself'' \"that''s not a bear\". I knew I had just seen a Bigfoot. WOW!!!<BR><BR>I saw it run towards the creek and I heard it crashing through the bushes down there. I did not follow. I''m not usually a scared kind of person, but I did not follow because I was scared. I had never seen anything like that in my life. I live in the woods and I have seen lots of bears and large animals. I  consider myself good at estimating, so I estimated it as 10 to 12 ft. tall and it probably weighed somewhere in the neighborhood of 1200 lbs. no lie.<BR><BR>Later that day I went down and looked on the trail the way it had gone. I found horse hair ferns that had been torn out from an area of about a thirty foot radius where something had torn them out and made a large \"bed\", for lack of a better word, there on the ground near a natural spring that comes out from under a maple tree. I walked down to the creek and found the tops of two very large footprints in the sand at the very edge of the creek. The prints disintegrated into the water as I watched them, but I was pretty freaked out by then.  <BR>          <BR>On with the story...<BR>Every night for a whole summer I would smell it in my yard, it smelled like a mixture of wet dog, garbage and sewer...if you can imagine that.<BR><BR>One night the smell woke me up gagging. I thought it was a bag of garbage I had left out on the porch that night. You see, it is so much easier to stay in a sort of denial when you see these things. It really is too hard to believe what you are encountering. Anyway, the cameras were up in my yard at that point and I had these computers in my house so I sat down at the computer and started looking at my emails. <BR><BR>There is a window right next to my sliding glass door where my porch and stairs are. I heard a small sound behind me at that window while my back was turned away at the monitor and when I looked I saw a huge dark face in that window. The face was tilted slightly and I could make out the shiny spots at the brow and bridge of the nose. It was very dark outside and what I saw was the reflection of the things face in the light from the dining room. I looked at it and it looked back at me for a few seconds and then it turned away. A few seconds later I heard a loud bang as it slammed something into the end of the trailer. I looked later and found a big dent.<BR><BR>I got up and ran out onto the porch. I actually thought it was pranksters. I got out on the porch and noticed how dark it was in the yard at that point. I yelled, \"Get out of here!\" I thought that would scare away any kids that might be in my yard when suddenly every hair in my body stood on end. Have you ever been around a lion when the hairs on the back of you neck stand up, Yeah kind of like that, but about 50 times stronger?  I suddenly thought...man, this thing is right here in the yard with me. I promptly panicked...ran inside...and locked my door.<BR><BR>A few nights later I saw it walk across my property. There is a field light across my property in my neighbors yard and I saw it backlit as it walked down to the creek. I saw a tall figure...@12 ft. tall with large mounded shoulders and a sort of conical shaped head. I saw very long arms swinging as it walked. I could only see the top portion of this guy because it was walking by 8 ft. tall blackberry bushes.<BR><BR>I went up on the hill behind my house with a friend and we found a footprint up there. It freaked me out too because I wasnt expecting to find anything to tell you the truth. We made a cast and I would very much like to have that cast. I heard it is in litigation.<BR><BR>I have been up the hill above my house since then and I have found places with big holes in the ground where \"beds\" have been made. Some of them have crude frames in them made from 12 inch diameter snapped off branches that are crisscrossed to form frames. I thought that was strange. In those places there are numerous foot and handprints.<BR>", :environment "There are two water features on this property that may be of interest.

Five years ago I interviewed a group of young people regarding a sighting. The sighting took place in the Mojave rive bed in Hesperia California. The first report came from five teenage boys who were exploring down in the riverbed late in the after noon when a noise in the dense under brush that grows in places along the river startled them.<BR><BR>They said the noise sounded like something big moving through it. When they moved closer to get a look they said they saw a large hairy ape like creature. As this frightened them, the boys ran home and told their parents, which is when I first heard the story. The boys father went down into the area of the sighting with a gun to see if he could see what the boys had reported, but found nothing. <BR><BR>The boys older sister rode her horse down to the spot on two consecutive days, to try and get a look at the creature. On the second day, her efforts were rewarded. In her statement to me she said, \"I was riding north in the river bed on my way home after searching for several hours, when I came to an area where there are two stands of cottonwood and pepper trees one on each side of the trail. My horse spooked and didn''t want to go on. I looked around and to my right I saw a tall hairy thing standing there looking at me. It looked at me for about a minute, then I turned my horse and ran her in the opposite direction and took another trail home.\" <BR><BR>I investigated the area and though I wasn''t able to see the Bigfoot itself, I did find what seemed to be a nest of sorts where the animal had been bedding down. I also found footprints that measured twenty inches by eleven inches. These prints were in very soft deep river sand so I''m sure the size is out of proportion, but maybe this will assist you in determining the animals size. When I asked the young woman about color she said it was a dark brown or black. I didn''t think about it after making my own documentation until I read the recent article in the Mohave Daily News Archives.<BR><BR> After reading the article I thought my information might be useful to you.

It sounded like it came from about 1 mile south of our campground. Needless to say we were pretty scared. <BR><BR>We all went to sleep about 12:00 a.m. At about 1:00 a.m. my buddy Kenny woke we up and told me that there was something moving around in the bushes and trees next to our campground.

Anyway in May 1982, while serving on active duty at Camp Pendleton, CA, I was temporarily assigned to a staff of Marines supervising a youth program consisting of a rigorous series of two week long mini-boot camps for teen-aged boys.<BR><BR>Camp Pendleton is flanked by the Pacific on its western flank and by the Cleveland National Forest [on its] northeastern flank. Three different Mt. ranges intersect the base itself and I am very familiar with every nook and cranny on its over 200,000 acres of mountains, ridges, ravines, canyons, trails, back roads and the like.<BR><BR>Anyway on one particular calm night after a long grueling day of forced marches, displays and demonstrations we took all 300 boys up to a bivouac site for the night. The site is situated on large, open meadow shelf above the Infantry Training School at San Onofre/52 area. The boys were exhausted yet eagerly setting up their shelter-halves. They began to get a little too loud, so I began to quiet them and bed them down for the night. The rest of the staff was situated about 35 meters away, up on a little knoll that overlooked the boys. However, I wasn''t aware that the staff had already bedded down and that I was the last one still up except for the radio watch, which was half asleep too.<BR><BR>It had become dark with exception of a bit of starlight, which gave me a very good range of vision. Finally I succeeded in getting the kids in the sack and quiet. I then stood for a few moments to ensure all was secure and that not one peep could be heard and none could be.<BR><BR>As I turned facing west and looked towards the closest edge of the perimeter I noticed a tall, dark, bulky figure standing about 15 meters beyond the last tent or 20 meters from where I stood. We seemed to be staring at each other, but it&#8217;s hard to say because I could not make out any of its facial definition, but I had a strong gut feeling that it was checking me out real good since I was the only thing moving around. I could feel my heart begin to pound and my entire body felt like it wanted to anchor to the ground. There was no doubt someone or something very odd and dangerous was standing there looking at me. I mean this thing was TALL and wide at the shoulders.<BR><BR>I used my peripheral vision to make sure I wasn''t seeing things, but it only confirmed what I already knew. It gently and slightly moved its upper body left and right ever so slowly as though looking around to its front, surveying the area. It was an easy 8 feet tall. Like I mentioned previously, all I could make out was its massive silhouette and no real detail features. It had very broad shoulders, little or no neck, dark, and looked very powerful.<BR><BR>I decided to go get a flashlight out of our vehicle at the top of the knoll and let staff know what was going on. So I began to cautiously and quietly step backwards to prevent whatever it was from charging or coming into bivouac. I continued to keep an eye on the dang thing, which just remained in the same spot. Almost halfway up the knoll I lost sight of it, but I continued to move slowly still trying to locate it. From atop of the knoll it was very difficult to see anything clearly outside the fringe of perimeter because of the dark.<BR><BR>I walked back down to the tents, scanned the area with the flashlight, but didn&#8217;t see anything like I had before. The figure had obviously moved. So instead of waking anybody up I sat up for a while and waited to see what and if anything would happen. I also hoped the darn thing wouldn''t pop up behind me (we were all unarmed). It would have been worse and maybe a calamity if I had  pushed the panic button and had waken everybody up. After all, we were in charge of nearly 300 young street kids without any formal training, out in the open and I didn&#8217;t need the grief if nothing I said or described could have been verified. Thankfully nothing else occurred that night.<BR><BR>In the morning just before daybreak I bee-lined for the spot where I saw the thing standing. There wasn''t anything there ... nothing. Not a pole, a bush, a tree, a reed.  I mean nothing that could have simulated what I had seen. We were situated on flat, clear open ground with exception of the knoll and a tree line about 50 to 60 meters away and a mountain behind that which I knew all existed and had seen back-dropped way beyond the figure the previous evening.<BR><BR>The ground was grassy, but was already pretty well matted down and rutted by the constant foot and vehicle movement in that particular training area. I know I saw something that wasn''t normal. I know  it wasn''t hoax, I know it wasn&#8217;t the kids (they were all accounted for). I trust my judgment and I&#8217;m now 46 years old and still have perfect vision. I know it wasn''t any of the staff because I had seen all of them sleeping when I got up the hill. At that time I had nearly 11 years of active military service in the infantry and had done plenty of night OP''s [ed: Observation Posts] to know how to use my eyes in the dark and to know the difference between a bush and a moving object.

Now, in the Lagunas around Julian, in San Diego County, I have been actively pursuing reports of Bigfoot in these mountains and the Anza-Borrego Desert below, and most particularly within a certain Indian Reservation. In February, 1981, I happened to be at the right place at the right time to meet a young Indian who talked openly of his interest in Bigfoot and said he had seen him on his reservation and knew the location of caves where Bigfoot hid, and he would take me there - now!<BR><BR>He guided me up a fearfully storm-wrecked road. My ancient van was not designed for such, nor my senior years to cope, but once started there was no turning back. Disaster seemed certain but I would die TRYING! We reached a small flat. \"Park here,\" my escort said. \"Now we hike down a canyon.\"<BR><BR>He hiked ahead rapidly and I eventually caught up with him - napping under a bush. Below him, a small stream followed a darkened canyon around a bend. I had parked in bright sunshine and in less than a mile we had descended into sunless gloom. \"The caves are over there, but I am NOT about to go there.\" <BR><BR>Until my guide refused to enter a taboo area, I had not really believed his story. I knew that no money or incentive on earth will induce an Indian to enter taboo ground. \"Okay, now we wait. Have a seat.\" I said to him, \"What are we waiting for?\" He said, \"To watch. He comes out this time of the day and walks around. He drinks from those old rock-troughs I showed you by the road. Sometimes he hangs out by that wrecked house where the road loop starts. You in a hurry?\" <BR><BR>I told him no, but that I was not about to drive back down the road in the dark. We hiked back to my van which was completely concealed in the brush until you reached the road. It was dusk when I drove out of the Reservation. <BR><BR>After a week of heavy storms had eased up, I sought out my Indian escort. Unlike before, he was neither friendly nor talkative. Briefly I was then told, \"My people are complaining. Our tribal spokesman is very displeased. You will not be welcome to return, with or without your friends - and <BR>trespassers risk being shot.\" So, I backed down for awhile - but I was not \"out.\"<BR><BR>For three months I planned for a return trip. A friend obtained permission from a well-known Indian to drive up the mountain just to take pictures, to stay on the road and not to wander around the reservation. I had studied the map well but a certain hunch compelled me to request we reverse our direction. After a steep turn, we were blocked - but good - by a heavy pick-up in the road next to a parked bulldozer. In front stood five Indians - shoulder to shoulder, spanning the road, with their backs to us.<BR><BR>\"Looks like we''ve got trouble,\" my escort said, very quietly. He stepped out with a cheery greeting and, as a Forest Service firefighter, was recognized. Two men approached me. \"You see Bigfoot this morning?\" They knew who I was. \"No, and I came up here just to shake hands with him.\" That brought welcomed laughter, then a statement, \"I have seen him. He comes up from the canyon below the flat you just passed. He doesn''t come out very often.\" <BR><BR>This confirmed what my first Indian guide had told me.

I came to the department the previous year. I was working out there in a patrol capacity for the San Diego County Sheriff''s Department I was a deputy at the time and actually worked Alpine for about 2 years, from March of 1970 to April of 1972. As far as trying to recall exactly when this went down, the best I can come up with is that it was after the Laguna fire of 1970 ... September of 1970. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: The Laguna fire affected which areas?<BR><BR>HUSE: Well, it was the largest brush fire at the time in California history, and burned specifically in the Sweetwater River area from east of Alpine all the way south and west, probably another 15 miles. It was quite an extensive burn and through the area in question, Alpine, on the south side of Interstate 8. To recall the chain of events, it was extremely cold which means the time of year would''ve been sometime after September of 1970, probably December or January, maybe February...let''s see, that would be 1971 ... well, it was definitely winter. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Was that about the time of your first contact with the key witness, Dr. Baddour (prominent San Diego psychiatrist)? <BR><BR>HUSE: Yes, and I don''t recall the reason, but Dr. Baddour was stopped by a two-man patrol unit. Baddour was traveling eastbound, which would''ve been from the San Diego area to what we learned later was his home in Alpine. On the front seat of his car, I don''t remember what kind of car it was, he had a loaded .44 magnum revolver with a 6-inch barrel. That''s the same type of gun that Dirty Harry made famous. It''s the largest caliber hand gun you can buy. Of course this piqued our interest a little bit. I wasn''t the contact, I was what we call the cover during this particular stop. My partner''s the one who made first contact and found the gun. He secured the revolver and was asking the doctor, who''d identified himself as Dr. Baddour, why he was carrying the weapon. Baddour said it was because of a ... and I don''t know what he actually said at the time, but my partner heard him say, \"Zoobie,\" ... and so from there on all our conversations throughout the department referred to whatever Dr. Baddour had seen as a Zoobie. That wasn''t what the doctor actually called it, I don''t believe, but that''s what my partner heard and that''s how the name got coined.<BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: At the time did Dr. Baddour describe this Zoobie to the officer? <BR><BR>HUSE: Yes, he did, to both of us as a matter of fact. He described the Zoobie as a large, upright, walking hairy creature. Dr. Baddour convinced us and later other members of my department, including one of my patrol sergeants, that in truth he''d had three separate encounters with the Zoobies. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Did Dr. Baddour say how many of these Zoobies there were and where the sightings happened? <BR><BR>HUSE: Yeah, one sighting was made by his entire family within the confines of his yard and immediate area, and at one time they saw three Zoobies. What Dr. Baddour described to us was what he assumed was a father, mother and child with the largest of the Zoobies being over 6 feet tall, maybe 7 feet tall. The tallest was very hairy and much larger-framed than an ordinary man. What he described as the mother was about 5 feet tall, and the smaller one was about 3 or 4 feet tall. Like I said, the doctor convinced a number of us that he''d in fact seen something unusual. What happened then was that we did get involved in an investigation of the sightings. I did because of the shift I worked which was either 10 p.m. at night to 6 a.m., or what we called the evening or overlap shift which was from 6 p.m. to 2:30 in the morning. Neither of those shifts was conducive to interviewing citizens in the area, so I wasn''t able to locate other witnesses, and I can''t recall if I ever talked, to a deputy who canvassed the area looking for witnesses. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: How many people lived in the area at the time? <BR><BR>HUSE: There were very few homes, probably 5 or no more than 6 residences, and Baddour''s was the last home on the narrow road. Going back in my memory 20 years now, I''d say his house was a quarter to a third of a mile off the main road used to get to his place, almost in a straight line due south of Alpine Blvd. That area hasn''t grown much since then, no planned residential development in there. At that time the Baddour family themselves consisted of the doctor, his wife, a daughter and a son. The daughter was 17 and the son was younger, maybe 13 or 14. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Can you describe what the terrain looks like, is it actually alpine forest, etc.?<BR><BR>HUSE: It''s not a forest by any means, the elevation''s no more than 2300 feet. The road goes east and up, and in about another 20 miles it eventually climbs to about 5000 feet. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Does it continue up into forested areas? <BR><BR>HUSE: Yes it does and it follows the Sweetwater River it''s about 10 miles. The Sweetwater River isn''t much of a flowing river. It runs about three-quarters of a mile south of Dr. Baddour''s place. Of course it always depended on rainfall, but the river hasn''t run continuously anytime in the 20 years I''ve been familiar with the area. There''s no snowfall at all. The terrain itself is quite steep behind Dr. Baddour''s property, going down into the (Sweetwater) river bottom itself. It''s all primarily brush and chaparral.<BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Any bears in the area? <BR><BR>HUSE: I don''t think I''ve ever heard of a bear sighting in San Diego county, and again I''ve been in the area almost 23 years. We have deer everywhere here along with coyotes and fox and other types of wildlife, but no bears. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: What else do you remember about Dr. Baddour''s sightings? <BR><BR>HUSE: Let''s see, the first set of circumstances I remember was Dr. Baddour finding damage to the house when he''d just moved in. He said he bought the house from an older German couple and all of the light bulbs, inside and out, were the yellow bug repellent type. Baddour said the German man told me that he shouldn''t change them to white, that he should get used to the yellow light.<BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Because of an insect problem? <BR><BR>HUSE: Baddour said the German was very evasive about that, evasive also about a lot of details regarding the house and property. The property did have some acreage, I don''t recall the size but it was larger than a city lot anyway. The property had some fruit trees in the front and back yards. I don''t remember what kind of fruit trees they were, but the house and trees were surrounded by a fence. One of Baddour''s complaints was that fruit was being picked off the trees at the tops, but not from the bottoms. The trees were upward of 7 or 8 feet high, or maybe 10 feet high. Anyway, the fruit was disappearing from the tops of his trees and his fence was getting knocked down. He had a wind chime at one of the doors made of brass or some kind of strong metal which frequently rang in the blowing wind, and at one point the wind chime suddenly turned up flattened. Baddour couldn''t explain it and we couldn''t duplicate it. It was smashed. Baddour did make a plaster cast of a footprint and I know we had photographs of it, if we didn''t in fact have a plaster cast of the print ourselves. But I do recall there was a plaster cast. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Do you remember the approximate size of the footprint? <BR><BR>HUSE: I''m 6-foot-3 and I wear a size 12 shoe, and I''d have to say this one was larger than my shoe and much wider than my foot. I''d say it was about 13 or 14 inches in length, and I''ve been wracking my brain trying to remember if it had 4 toes or 5 toes, but I just can''t recall.** <BR><BR>[**According to researcher, Ken Coon, who visited the Alpine area in 1971, Dr. Baddour''s \"Zoobies\" left V -shaped, 4-toed footprints, 16 inches long and 8 inches wide with the widest measurement across the toes. The foot narrowed down to 5 inches at the heel.]<BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: But there''s some recollection that it might have had an usual number of toes? <BR><BR>HUSE: Yes, I do seem to remember that, but I can''t bring it to mind. I know the footprint was wide overall, and less wide at the heel, but the heel was still wider than a human foot would be. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Did you or any of the officers talk to the doctor''s wife or kids?<BR><BR>HUSE: Specifically the word came back to me, and I''m not sure which deputy found out, but the daughter said she had a sighting in the early morning hours as she boarded a school bus at Alpine Blvd. That would have been adjacent to the access road leading to the Baddour house. She was getting on the bus and spotted the creature off in the brush. There''s some very thick, very tall brush along the road there. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Do you remember any details of what she saw? <BR><BR>HUSE: No, not really, the man who was deeply involved in this was my patrol sergeant and he''s now deceased. He was so involved with it that on his days off he''d go up there and camp to the rear of Baddour''s house. He''d take his older son along and the two of them would camp out in hope of getting a glimpse of one of the Zoobies. They never did. But he was the man who probably had more conversations with the doctor than any-body else. Another sighting involved three Zoobies sighted by a whole family. The Baddours had made it a habit to never go out after dark, but one night they were out with the son to call in their pet dog. In the dark the boy thought he saw the dog near a comer of the house and called out to It. Well, the dog came running back, but from a different corner, and what at first they thought was the dog turned out to be the smaller Zoobie. Apparently it had been laying down and it got up and stood and walked the opposite way, joining the other two, the larger male and female, and they all walked off into the brush.<BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Did they ever use words like \"ape\" or \"gorilla\" to describe the creatures? <BR><BR>HUSE: No, they never did. Baddour was firm in his own mind that it wasn''t an ape or gorilla. It was something totally different than one of those. Well, for lack of anything better we thought it to be more like the California Bigfoot, based on how it was described. Whether it was black or brown I really can''t remember.<BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Did Dr. Baddour ever use the word Bigfoot or Sasquatch to describe the Zoobie? <BR><BR>HUSE: Not to me, no. As a matter of fact we were assigned to make periodic checks of his residence throughout the night because most of the damage to his property was done during the night time, so my partner and I in a two-man car would drive up there and shine the spotlight around his house. Dr. Baddour was very convincing. I can still picture him coming outdoors one night dressed in his skivvies and wearing black high top military boots. That was it, a tee-shirt and shorts with those black boots and carrying that big .44 magnum. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: How would you characterize the family, it sounds as though they were all educated, credible people? <BR><BR>HUSE: Yes, I''d characterize them as exactly that. I got the impression the daughter was very intelligent, and of course Baddour himself was a medical doctor, a psychiatrist. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: In our earlier phone call to arrange this interview you mentioned something about the creatures, the Zoobies, mimicking human speech ... ?<BR><BR>HUSE: Yes, one of the lighter stories I recall happened when the doctor got home after dark one night. They had chickens there, and earlier he''d called his wife to say he was going to be late and to remind her to feed the chickens before night fall, which she did. When the doctor got home he had to exit his car, open the gate, drove through and stopped, then got out of the car again to close the gate behind him. He said that when he went to close the gate that night he heard a very low, very guttural voice say, ''Here chicky, chicky, chicky...'' <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: That''s funny and not unprecedented in the research. Are you saying the impression was that one of the creature''s was imitating the doctors wife who''d called in the chickens earlier?<BR><BR>HUSE: Exactly. It was the doctor''s opinion, and we had no reason to doubt him, that the Zoobie had some type of intelligence and the capability of producing sounds like that. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Did they ever describe any other sounds or smells, anything like that? <BR><BR>HUSE: Smells, yes. A very pungent odor, maybe like rotting garbage. You know, he did tell us he''d set up cameras around the house with trip-wires, but he wasn''t able to get any photographs, at least not while I was working the area. I really can''t recall but I know the doctor himself had a close sighting of one of the Zoobies, and there were probably other sightings, but I can''t remember now. Of course I worked up there for just those two years, until April of 1972. After that I went to fly helicopters. So I was completely out of touch with what was happening in Alpine, and I didn''t get back there until 1981. At that time I was stationed east of the Baddour home, and I didn''t hear anything more. I did hear something about the Proctor Valley Monster when I started patrol in 1970, which if true I''d have to assume was on the order of what Dr. Baddour was describing. Now, a few years ago a deputy told me he saw a dark-colored, large, upright furry creature, not a bear and not human, up in some rocks north of Interstate 8, and possibly northwest of El Capitan (reservoir). The deputy told me it was a good distance away. Also, I was involved in a juvenile diversion camp (near Julian, northeast of Alpine), and a couple of counselors from another camp came down and told us they''d see something they couldn''t identify in the mountains. After talking with them it was concluded that what they''d seen was probably a Zoobie. Another thing we found out, during our investigation of Dr. Baddour''s sightings, was that the Viejas Indians (reservation) just north of Interstate 8 had a legend about a giant hairy man that was the protector of their burial grounds, and those burial grounds were located just about 2 miles north of where Dr. Baddour lived.", :environment nil, :fixed_year "1970", :run_time "2022-05-20 16:15:24.000000"} {:nearestroad "Pacific coast highway", :date nil, :locationdetails "I only know we were up in some small mountains or large hills(whatever you want to call them).

We heard something coming up the side of the mountain. We could hear rocks rolling down the mountain. It came up over the edge and the Marine with me yelled halt. It stood up right in front of us about 6 feet away. I could see the outline of this creature and it was hugh. It looked about 3 1/2 feet wide. It had long arms and a pointed head. It was very tall.

The lake runs on sort of an angle from west/northwest to east/southeast.  Just above the lake when travelling north on hwy 154 is an access road leading into the forest to a point near the northwest end of the lake (probably about 2 1/2 miles from the lake).  Near that point and about 3/4 to one mile away from the ranger station located there, my friend and I hunted along the west side of the road.  We were both armed with high powered rifles (I had a 300 H&H Magnum with 200 grain roundnose bullets).  This is rough country!  We were sitting on a hillside looking down the hill when we noticed what seemed to be movement.<BR><BR>After about 1/2 hr or so, and not seeing any more movement, we decided to go and investigate what the movement had been below us on the hillside.

First I must say that I don''t think a bigfoot lives real close to where I live but I do think we live within it''s (plural) normal range or migration route. <BR><BR>The first sighting was in 1998 in the winter, we are not really sure...  My brother was driving home and was on our private driveway when he drove by something that he could not describe.  He walked in andsaid he had just saw a bear or a big black person wearing animal fur, or a cow...  Basically his mind could not fit what he saw into any specific category  and he was very confused.  Upon questioning him he said it looked like a homeless person wearing animal skins.  He said they passed right by eachother going in opposite directions.  Since our road is a graveled one lane road they must have been within a couple of feet from eachother! He told me it had just happened so we went to investigate.  I was thinking there was a homeless person passing through... But then we turned a corner and I saw the footprint from about 50ft away!  I was so amazed that I stopped my truck and got out and immediately took off my shoe and sock to compare sizes...  I was not thinking about a bigfoot, it didn''t really cross my mind until a couple of years later actually...  I was still thinking it was a homeless person with huge barefeet!  I''m a size 12, I put my foot inside this track...  It was 4-6 inches longer and 3-4 inches wider than my foot.  And it was sunk into a hard pack dirt road about an inch or more.  Being 200lbs myself, I jumped around trying to make an impression an inch deep in this strata but to no avail.  I couldn''t sink my own track at all! I mean no inches, nada!  So now I was thinking about a homeless person wearing animal skins with huge feet and that was significantly heavier than me...  But there were two problems to this obvious bigfoot sighting (in hindsight)... Number one, bigfoot do not live so far south in California (or so I thought), and my brother did not come in and say, \"I just saw a bigfoot!\"  So it never occurred to either of us that this was a bigfoot sighting!!!  It wasn''t until a couple of years later that I asked him if what he saw could have been a bigfoot and he said,\" oh yeah, that makes sense now...\"  It took us awhile to put 2 and 2 together but we finally did with the help of this website.  I found it while web surfing and his sighting started to make sense...  Then I became more aware of my surroundings in relation to bigfoot.  We live in a typical second growth redwood forest with all the typical animals that I see quite often.  But I was never looking for bigfoot until now.  <BR>2004 was an exciting year.  We had 2 more sightings and a very loud vocal performance!  So, I was watching tv outside in the covered porch/ gazebo.  If you turn down the tv you can hear all of the night sounds as if you were outside.  Around 11:30ish pm  I heard something so I turned the tv off.  I then heard a very loud screaming roar right in front of my house.  And judging from the location of the first sound I heard that was distorted by the tv, I deduced that whatever this was was walking down my driveway and was very close!  It roared twice more while following the road.  I was dumbfounded!!!  And then I got scared... I''ve lived in the woods my whole life and think nothing of walking around in the dark with out a flashlight.  You couldn''t have dragged me outside at this point!  I''m 6''3, 220lbs, and this thing sounded huge. I compare the roar to the decibel level of a siren!  It just echoed off the hills.  I have compared it to the recordings on this sight and it is very close to the Washington recordings, especially the one from 2005.  I am so glad that my dad and mom both heard this!  It just gave you the impression that it had huge lungs to make such a loud noise!  But interestingly enough the last roar was ended with two very clear dog barks that I presume were mimicked...  All of the dogs in the vicinty were going crazy except the dogs that were the closest to where this thing had traveled...  <BR>Two nights later was the second sighting.  This time it was in the front yard of my Dads house.  I was leaving in my Suburban.  I was just edging down the driveway when I got something out of the corner of my eye.  I turned and looked at what appeared to be a large pile of redwood bark lying in the yard as if my dad had cut down one of his trees and had raked all the bark into a pile.  Redwood bark is reddish...  As I passed slowly by I realized that my dad had not cut down any of his trees and that there would be no reason for a large pile of redwood bark to be piled there.  What I have deduced is that a bigfoot was balled up hiding from me!  And it semi worked.  There was a fence between us and if I were in a smaller car I wouldn''t have seen it, but I was very high up in a raised Suburban so I could see over the fence.  It looked as if it was on it''s knees hunched over with its head on the ground and it''s arms over it head.  I say semi worked because I kept driving and didn''t realize what I had seen until a couple of minutes later.  When I went back my pile of redwood bark had disapeared.  I was so disapointed because I was only about 15 ft away! The next sighting I again missed out by seconds!  My wife and I were driving on our driveway and she said she had just I contact with someone...  I had driven about 30 more ft and stopped. I asked her and she said she saw a dark face with deep inset eyes and a shaggy head looking at her from behind a tree.  The windows of the car were still dewed up from the cold morning so I backed up and got out.  I heard bi pedal footsteps walking away through the oak leaves.  It was a very definitive sound...  I would have followed if I was not in business clothes...<BR>So I think a bigfoot or more lives in the area.  There are 60-70,000 acres near by and I believe we are in a corner of their range that they visit every once in awhile since the occurances are not everyday.

I want to say it was in the early fall of 1980, because my kids were very young. My husband and I were driving up Hecker Pass from Watsonville, on our way to Mt Madonna to meet relatives for what I want to say was a dinner or dinner event. it seems so long ago. It happened very fast, but what I saw looked covered in brown hair from head to toe and was huge, walking just like a man. It scared me to death! My husband wasn''t paying attention but he knew I saw something that frightened me terribly because I reacted emotionally so quickly. We were coming around a turn. I remember it being a very windy road, and it was walking with it''s back to me. It was a very foresty area with lots of redwoods everywhere. <BR><BR>It was so quick but so clear. I''m absolutely convinced of what I saw and still get shaken up when I think about it. I had great eyesight then and still have it now. I haven''t talked about this with many people and am not sure who I told back then other than maybe my immediete family. It''s been almost 30 years. <BR><BR>Last week my husband and I were celebrating 4th of July at a party. I was stunned as I overhead Bart Cutino talking to my cousin about bigfoot as he was walking out the door.  I had no idea he looks for them and I haven''t heard anything in the news in a long time. My eldest daughter used to babysit him when he was very young and I''ve known his mother my whole life. When I told him what I saw he convinced me to look at this site and report what happened.

I was 17 at the time, and would regularly take time off from high school with my parents permission to go on camping trips as long as I kept my grades up.  I do not remember the exact date''s as it has been nearly 26 years since the trip. <BR><BR>My friend and his brother had camped at the area the previous year in the Trinity Alps.  We departed from our homes in Whittier and Pico Rivera, Ca. in a newer model popup camper Volkswagen bus driven by one brother, and a ''69 VW bus driven by the other brother.  Since I was not driving I do not recall the highways or road to the campground that we took, and I no longer have contact with my friend and his family. I remember it took around 10 hours to get there.  We had to turn off the main highway on to a dirt road that we had to drive approximately 10 to 15 miles in order to reach the campground.  On the way to the campground on the dirt road there was patches of snow on the ground but the road was very drivable.  <BR><BR>About 8 miles on the dirt road we saw an older model VW Beetle coming towards us and we flagged it down, so we could ask the driver what the conditions were like at the campground.  The driver was alone and appeared to be in his mid to late 20s.  He had long hair and a beard and he appeared to be very nervous and distracted when he spoke to us.  He said, \"that the fishing was good along the river\" and thats about all I remember him saying besides \"good luck and for us to be careful\" before driving off.  The whole conversation only took about 2 minutes.  We continued on towards the campground and I remember us kidding to each other how weird the guy had acted as if something had frightened him. <BR><BR> When we got to the camp area we saw that there was no other campers around and no sign of any recent visitors.  We set up camp by parking the ''69 VW parallel to the river about 25 feet from the bank that led to the river and by parking the other bus the other way about 20 feet away from the ''69 bus with the fire ring between the two vehicles.  The popup VW was parked with it''s rear bumper facing the base of a long hill and the front facing the river about 45 feet from the river.  The campground was in a very remote and densely forested area nestled between large mountains in every direction.  <BR><BR>We set up camp and decided to go for a hike.  We hiked about five miles into a very primitive area along a trail that was hard to follow in some areas.  After awhile we came upon an old cabin.  The cabin appeared to be abandoned for some time by the shape it was in.  One of the brothers was able to get the door open and we all went inside.  There was a few old cans of food, an old rusted shotgun, old blankets, and an old gas lantern.  There were rodent droppings throughout the cabin, and we figured that it possibly was used by seasonal hunters.  We closed up the cabin, and continued our hike.  It was getting late so we decided to sleep under the stars that night instead of hiking back to the campground in the dark. I remember that it was one of the coldest nights I had ever been through as my frozen boots that I had left outside of my tent attested to in the morning.  <BR><BR>We hiked back to our camp the next morning, and prepared breakfast, and just kind of relaxed all day.  Later in the afternoon we took our guns out, and had target practice on some tin cans.  At night we made a huge fire in the pit, listened to music on the tape deck and talked about the day.  We all headed for bed around 9:30 or 10:00 that night. The cousin and I slept up in the canvas pop-top of the bus, while my friend and the older of his two brothers slept below on the foldout bed.  The other brother slept with his dog in the other bus. <BR><BR> Around 10:30 I remember I was almost asleep when I heard a noise coming from far above on the hill next to us.  I then heard something moving at a high rate of speed coming down the hill towards us.  Suddenly the whole bus started rocking back and forth from side to side and at one point I thought it was going to tip over.  I remember hanging on tight and then worrying that if the bus did roll over that I may be crushed if the popup collapsed so I dove for the floor of the bus, and a second later the cousin landed on top of me.  The bus stopped rocking suddenly and I remember hearing over our screams a lot of noise just outside of our vehicle.  We then heard yelling coming from the other brother in his bus and his dog barking like crazy.  We tried looking out the windshield and the side windows but it was iced up and fogged up from the cold.  In a second it was dead quiet again.  We rolled down the passenger side window and called out to the other brother if he was ok.  He said that he was and we all slowly got out of the buses.  The brother in our bus had grabbed his 44 Magnum, and led the way out.  The first thing I noticed was that all of our backpacks had been flung about the camp and that my pack and the cousins pack had been torn open and the contents of our packs was strewn everywhere.  We left everything where it was, and we all crammed into the popup bus for the rest of the night.  Needless to say we barely slept that night. <BR><BR> The next morning we cleaned up the mess outside, and speculated on what could have attacked us. The whole attack lasted only a few minutes.  We ruled out a bear because there were no bear tracks. And a bear would have still been in the area.  I climbed the hill behind our bus that I heard whatever it was that had come after us, and I noticed long skid marks that started higher than I could climb, but I saw no footprints.  I tried to match the stride of the skid marks coming down the hill but couldn''t because of the steepness of the hill and the space between the skid marks. We went on with our day by preparing and eating breakfast, and later going for a short hike, and again shooting our guns at targets.  I think that we were all a little edgy after the attack, and I know I kept looking around and over my shoulder whenever possible. <BR><BR> Later that night we again sat around the campfire, and listened to music, and talked.  And again we went to bed around the same time.  We kept the same sleeping arrangements and I remember being jumpy at every little sound that I heard outside.  Once again I remember that I was almost asleep when again I heard a noise coming from high above us.  I then heard something rolling down the hill towards us, and the back of our bus being hit by some large object.  I remember all of us saying something like \"oh no, not again\".  I then heard the same sounds as the night before coming fast at us from the hill.  This time I didn''t wait, and I dove for the floor, and again the cousin landed on top of me.  And once again the bus started to rock violently from side to side for about 30 seconds.  My friends brother had kept his 44 near him, and he was waving it around at the windows, and I remember thinking that one of us may get shot by accident.  When the shaking stopped we again heard the other brother yelling from his bus and his dog going nuts.   We tried to see through the iced over windows again with no success.  We exited our bus as soon as we were sure the attacks were over, and called out to the other brother who said he was ok.  I remember the strong smell of something for a short while.  With our flashlights beaming we conducted a brief search of the immediate area.  <BR><BR>This time our packs were undisturbed.  We walked to the back of our bus, and there was a large rock about 3 feet in diameter wedged between the rear bumper, and the back tire on the drivers side.  One side of the rock had a very pointed edge to it, and it was inches from the tire.  Whatever had attacked us had thrown the boulder down first before it began its attack on us.  We then noticed that the other bus that the brother was in, which was the closest to the river, had been either pushed or dragged about 5 feet towards the river.  Whatever had attacked us had been very fast and extremely strong, to have attacked so quickly, and to have moved a whole VW bus by itself.  Again I don''t remember getting much sleep that night, and the next morning we cut our trip short by packing everything up, and getting the hell out of there.<BR><BR>  Ironically the first campground that we came to was the Bigfoot RV Park not far down the main highway if that helps with the location at all. We stayed there for the night and used the showers to clean up, and we slept for 12 hours straight as I recall before leaving for home the next day. I remember not having to drive too far to where there was a statue of Bigfoot in a town called Red Bluff or something like that on the way home. <BR><BR> I am 43 years old now, and I have only told this story to a few people including my wife and three kids.  My friends and I never really talked about it when we got back from our trip only because it was so surreal, and I personally thought that people would think that I made it up, or I was insane or something.  I remember for a long time after the trip that I would still get the chills if I was home alone, and I would think about the attacks.  To this day I really don''t have any idea what it was up there.  I have thought about everything that it could have been including that crazy looking guy we met on our way to the campground but it would have been impossible for him to match the strength and quickness that I witnessed those two nights.  I don''t believe in supernatural forces, monsters, aliens, and creatures that have never been discovered. <BR><BR> I consider myself an intelligent man, and a reasonable person.  I see enough in the real world as a peace officer to believe in fairytales.  I am only writing about my adventure because I saw the article on bigfoot on AOL, and decided to check out the web site.  I thought it would be fun to share my incident with you.  To this day I am not saying that we were attacked by a bigfoot, because we never saw anything to support that claim.  I am only saying what I am saying, and that we were attacked twice by some unknown man or animal, with enormous quickness, stealth and strength. <BR><BR>The next year my friend went back to the same campground with his brother and another friend, and no further incidences occurred. I am open to any reasonable explanation, but I don''t lose any sleep over this after all these years.  I just thought this would interest you.     <BR>", :environment "Huge mountains, dense forest, rugged landscape, and a river about 40 ft. across, about 15 miles from the nearest highway.", :fixed_year "1977", :run_time "2022-05-20 16:15:56.000000"} {:nearestroad "Olive Springs Rd.", :date nil, :locationdetails "This is near the epicenter of the ''89 Earthquake.

I gave it a wide girth and slowed down and circled the area for about 2-3 minutes. I remember feeling freaked out a bit having this vision of it lunging out of the water at me.  Shortly after I continued back to Jones Valley resort and tried to put it out of my head. I wish now more than ever I would have taken the time to search for it but I just figured my initial thought had to be incorrect. I reasoned naturally it had to be something else. A beaver? Muskrat?

It was late and it was a boring uneventful dark drive up this \"Bigfoot Highway 96, but finally we crossed a bridge on the Klamath River and got to a campground where we finally saw trailers and trucks and people type stuff. The road then goes up a switchback to a ridge for a mile or so, and I slowed my speed down to 25 mph. <BR><BR>So, as I got to the ridge, maybe a couple miles from the bridge, I came around this last switchback, and to the right my headlights swept the left embankment and I thought there was a bear coming down the embankment towards the highway. I slowly crept ahead and began to stop as this bear was shuffling down this embankment on two feet, but it was not a bear. I stopped completely and not over one hundred feet in front of me was this thing intent on getting across the road the road in front of me.<BR><BR>If I didn''t see it on the bank I probably would''ve hit it, because it was that close. It got to the center line in three long steps and looked at me and then jumped off the road.  I mean from the centerline on its right leg it jumped clear off the pavement and over a two foot embankment and was out of sight. <BR><BR>It was not overly tall probably just six feet or a little taller, but extremely was thick maybe in the 300 pound range this thing was built. It was hair not fur and matted and dark brown but with a rusty auburn tint to it. I was extremely close with high beams on, and stopped in the road. It had long arms like a gorilla or something, and it sort of lumbered forward like a gorilla only fast with definite long strides; it had something it was aiming for and when it looked at me it turned its head back straight and this thing jumped off the road like an elk on one leg. It had extremely thick legs and shoulders, and no man could make a jump like that. If I had a video camera in the dash of my car you would have seen the video of your life. I couldn''t make out any genitalia it was so hairy I would estimate its body hair like six inches long and matted and dangly, but not so much on its butt or the back of its legs. I could make out the thighs and they were some guns. <BR><BR>I was too scared to get out of my car to look over the embankment, that and my daughter was freaked out. Get the heck out of here.

My son and I took a short vacation to my childhood memories trip area to French Gulch where I remembered an eerie thing that happened back in the mid 60''s with my father. I had lived with my grandparents in an small town called Summit City just a few miles below Shasta Lake Dam when my father one day took me to French Gulch way way back deep into the woods North and North East of the French Gulch town. <BR><BR>I remember always feeling as though being watched and sometimes herd really eerie sounds. I remember the eerie sound that made this worse for me to be comfortable. I was a naturalist though and always felt drawn to the deep woods and so it was hard to keep me from it. In latter years after retiring from the U.S. Army I took a trip visiting relatives in Redding, and one evening I packed up the truck for an deep adventure back to those woods and was their mostly to get those big pine cone''s with delicious pine nuts. <BR><BR>We left late that evening, getting their as it turned near dark and I felt my memories would help me find the places I had been as an teen with my dad and park and get some sleep and then wake up at some old cabin. It was as if I could practically reach out to the stars that clear bright night and (as well the moon was out partially) some of the ledges on those high peaks were a bit scary driving by them as it was so dark and far down I couldnt see how far. Then after about three hours of this turn and that and many miles I had forgot to count, and my son fell asleep; I became tired and stopped. <BR><BR>I turned off the truck engine and left the headlights on as I saw so many pine cones about an foot or longer and I began to load a few up. I had a camper shell on the little Plymouth arrow Pickup and could lock ourselves in for the night when time came. <BR><BR>Before I stopped, I just happened to turn the truck around on the road as it made it easier to load some of the pine cones and as I got out beginning to loading more pine cones, that is when I heard that noise and it was very close. I was petrified at the sound as it is nothing like the elk calls that sound a bit eerie too. I began to slowly pick up a few more pine cones as these were only for decorating for our Christmas seasons and as in my childhood days, I would get the green ones that made it from last autumn and were still on the pine trees as I was still the tree climber. I had reached down to pick up the fifth pine cone and it was then I just froze up and full of panicky fear. I could hear up the side of the ledge, ridge, to my right clearly a heavy pounding of what sounded like something very large. Only two distant sounds pounding the ground and the damn thing was coming fast. I dropped the pine cones at once and ran up to the drivers side fumbling in fear with the door trying to get in the truck. Then I started the truck up and was trying to put it into 1st gear and jammed it in just as I let out the clutch awaking my 7 year old son. I had heard the sound coming down behind the right rear of the truck just before I got the truck started. I happened to look back in the darkness behind the truck as it darted forward and in the dimness of the tail lights I seen this awful dark hairy figure standing upright behind the truck. The moon and the stars were out which helped me see this figure form as well. I had been stricken with such fear that I had never known before at this moment and nearly drove off the side of the road when my son said, Dad, watch out !!. I then nearly flipped the truck over, just missing a small log. I had no gun with me.  I would have not feared what this was, and would have shot in the air as a warning or at it if I had to. <BR><BR>It was that darn eerie sound and the sound of the thing coming down the steep hillside, and at that second the issue of absolute fear of not having any defense, that got my spirit stirred. I knew for sure it wasnt a bear, as that memory is still just as plain to see today. It took a while before my son got me to say what happened on the way back as I was barrowing down the mountain as fast as I could, and am surprised I didnt forget each turn I had to make on the roads I chose going out on the way back. <BR><BR>We just pulled into French Gulch when daylight was breaking and I had to stop and sleep for an hour or so when my son woke me up whining about being hungry.  I woke up a bit dazed and it came back to me what had happened and I started up the truck and headed back for Redding.  My son was teasing me, Oh dad it was probably just a bear.<BR><BR>We reached Uncle Bills place on the right side of the road well before Redding where he lived on some property of his brothers wifes Father; an Italian whom passed away. Still to this day my son teases me at his age 23. <BR><BR>I was a ranch care taker a few years back in Flagstaff, Arizona, and I had seen a lot of things and heard a lot of things, but nothing that could ever compare to what I experienced on that early morning above French Gulch, and I surely didnt want to.  I always carried a gun with me on that ranch just the south side of Rodgers Dry Lake even in the surrounding woods.<BR><BR>Their were signs posted before entering that forest North of French Gulch stating to keep out during the evening (Night) and cut firewood only during daylight hours.  I hadnt been their for so many years and wanted to experience what I remembered as an teen, but I sure wouldnt have if I had known what I would have encountered that night.<BR><BR>Im very serious, because I''ve studied the Sasquatch or Bigfoot ever since, and would go with someone else today and be a lot more prepared for such an venture, but never again alone like that night and without some serious protection. I have never herd of where this big beast has come up on some one like me and acting like it did, but it sure did with me.<BR><BR>I hope someone does get some physical evidence because I havent enjoyed being teased all these years; also we could put an end to the mystery of this beast. I''ve known what it was like to have big bears visit at night up in the high country of the Colorado Mountains, Rabbit Ear Mountain-Pass area, where I camped with wife and our first born.  Ive been around the world and seen a lot of things from the mountains in West Germany and in South Korea in the Ming Dung Mountains where the Siberian tiger still remained back in 1975. In all those years I have never had such a scare. My body and hands were trembling and I was scared down to the core of my being.<BR><BR>Sincerely, <BR><BR>Sgt. M.L.D.

I was 13 at the time and I had never heard of Bigfoot. The way our camp was laid out was that all of us girls (two sisters, their friends and a friend of mine) were all staying in one big army tent. My brother and his friend were in a smaller tent off to the east closer to the drop off to the lake. Then my parents were in their own tent at the far west end of the campsite. There had been a lot of trouble with bears that summer so all campers were advised to hang their food high up in the trees. My Dad did that and I remember him standing under the bag of food a good three feet over his head about 10 to 15 feet from the door to our tent to the left. My Dad was 5''10\".<BR><BR>As for myself, I really wanted to see a bear. I was a very outdoorsy kid and would have preferred to sleep outside of the tent actually. I had little fear of the dark, or the night, and it was my goal to see a bear. I am quit sure we were there for two weeks that year and as I remember it, my sighting occurred about a week in to being there ... since I spent several days after that looking for traces of what I had seen.<BR><BR>I slept closest to the door and somewhere during the middle of the night I heard a little stirring outside. Everyone else was asleep and I didn''t wake anyone since I had already been informed (emphatically) that no one else wanted to see a bear. I very quietly and carefully crawled to the door of the tent and cautiously stuck my head out the door. I looked over to where the food bag was hanging and saw something that was unquestionably NOT a bear. What I saw was two dark hairy creatures just standing there under the food bag like they were negotiating how to get it down or something. One of them was a good foot taller than the other. My Dad would have come to the bottom of chest of the biggest one. They were just huge! The smaller one was probably just a head taller than my dad. I had that as a gauge after all since I had seen my Dad standing there in the very same spot under the bag, and he hung the food bag in the same place every night. They were VERY tall and very upright.<BR><BR>I had never heard of a Bigfoot at that time, but I knew these were not bears. Bears are pear shaped and standing upright isn''t a position of comfort for them. For that matter, they don''t just ''stand'' next to each other like they are carrying on a conversation. The incident took place very quickly. It was fast, but I was VERY impressed and it was clear to me immediately that I was seeing something extraordinary.<BR><BR>What happened was that as I saw them, and saw that they were something unexpected, I did one of those surprised intakes of breath ... a true ''gasp'' I guess you could say. They heard that and both turned and looked at me. Then, they turned and looked at each other, looked back at me again, and then ... they were just gone. They made not a sound. One moment they were there, and then they were not. I did not go out of the tent. I did think about it, but ... I laid awake all that night thinking about it. I had absolutely no idea what I had seen.<BR><BR>The next morning the first thing I did was go out in the direction I saw them leave to see if I could find tracks, but the earth was very hard and dry there. I didn''t see anything. It might be that someone more skilled than I was at the time might have found some trace, but I didn''t. I did spend a goodly amount of the remainder of that vacation watching and walking in the woods. I recall I even passed on water skiing a few times to go search the woods.<BR><BR>I didn''t tell anyone what I saw until a few years later. I told NO ONE at the time. I was the youngest in my family and already endured a considerable amount of teasing on a regular basis ... you know, kid stuff. I was not about to tell anyone I saw a 7 foot (or so) tall hairy man creature in the campsite. It would not have gone well.<BR><BR>Oh, what I saw of them ... Hairy, with long hanging brown to black hair. I didn''t catch any gender features. I just assumed the smaller one was female, but I have no reason to think that since I was mostly just seeing their height ... and the fact that they looked at me ... they LOOKED at me. Uh ... there just aren''t words. I did catch that the arms were quite long and they were very big in the chest, shoulders and upper arms, not so much in the hips.  Nope these were not bears at all. I do not recall if there was any strong scent associated with my sighting. <BR><BR>I didn''t know what I saw until a year or so later when I saw a picture of the famous movie footage.

In hindsight I remember how odd it was for it to be that quiet on a Saturday night on Lake Shasta. Not even insects were making any noise.I had been sitting in front of a small, almost-out fire for some time when I heard a large tree branch break about 50 yards away. It was sort of an instant ''pop'' sound and the branch never hit the ground. Initially it startled me but after about 10 minutes I had just written it off as one of the normal noises that the woods make at night. Then I heard another branch break in the same fashion maybe 10-15 yards from where the first had been broken, again never hitting the ground. Within a minute or two I heard approximately 10 to 13 VERY heavy footsteps heading more or less in my direction.

My friends and I had camped up in this area off and on all this time, but on this day I had went to the mountain myself since my friends were done hunting for the year due to not seeing any bucks.  I however thought I would give it one more try.  It was late Sept 2000 early morning around 7.00 am and I was driving up a dirt road that I had been up and down many times before when I noticed a very old skid road covered in bush.  I knew that there was a large draw behind the bush because I could see just the top of it, so I parked my truck and started to walk up the skid road. There was a small creek on my left as the bush started to clear and I could see up the draw so I stopped to hunt for a while. At this time I was about 150 yds up the old road standing by the creek.

The first time was one summer in the late 1970s. My friend and I were camping in the Tahoe National Forest in California. We were camping out of a station wagon, as we did not have a tent. My friend was cooking on the Hibachi, and I was sitting on the tailgate of the station wagon watching him. We were in a newly planted area of seedling pines. The surrounding that area was old growth pine trees. I looked over at the old growth area and there stood Big Foot. He was about 5'' tall, and hairy all over. His eyes were large as if he were use to living in darker environment. I told my friend to turn around slowly, and look, as he did the Bigfoot melted out of sight back into the forest.<BR> <BR>After we had gone to bed for the night around 2:00 AM in the morning, something hit the station wagon so hard that it rocked back and forth.

Wayne, Ginger the dog, and I were bass fishing on the lake, and the weather was warm. On the shore was Bigfoot walking down towards the water. When he got there he swooped his left arm down into the water as if he were checking a trap to see if there were any fish in it. He stood up and walked up the steep hill without any effort.  He was huge.  From the boat he appeared to be at least 7 to 8 feet tall. He had long shaggy hair, very dark brown. While all of this is going on Ginger the dog was going berserk. She was running around the boat yelping and howling. I told Wayne there is Bigfoot. He did not see him. The place where we had launched the boat was in the Jones Valley Resort area.<BR><BR>When I tell people I have seen Bigfoot, and they think I am crazy. I''m not.

The only way I would go is if someone offered me (serious money), because I \"seriously\" don''t want to go back there. I met enough Indians, that would tell you the same thing.
