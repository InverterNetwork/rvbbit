Fossil Ridge northeast of Gunnison, CO when this incident ocurred.  It was late afternoon when we noticed a strong odor that we thought might be elk so we headed east toward a small ridge hoping to find one on the other side.  As we got closer we heard the noise of rocks being banged together.  As we topped the ridge we saw a large dark brown animal squatting at the edge of a dry creek bed with it''s back toward us. It was banging 2 rocks together with it''s \"hands\" and making a grunting/growling noise each time the  rocks hit.<BR><BR>It seemed to sense our presence almost immediately and turned around and looked at us.  Then it quickly stood up and jumped across the creek in one motion.  I remember thinking \"nothing can move like that!\".  It ran up the slope on the north side of the creek bed at an angle and disappeared into the pine and aspen trees farther up the hill.  We could see it for about 50 feet before it was gone from sight.  It moved real quietly for something that big.<BR><BR>I estimate it''s height as 6''5''''.  It was covered with long dark brown hair that made me think of a yak.  It had a strong smell, at least there was a strong smell in the area that was like elk urine.<BR><BR>After we calmed down a bit, we went into the creek bed and found the 2 rocks which were chipped and broken.  We looked for other signs in that place but couldn''t find anything else." 1, " I was working in the northern part of New Mexico training to be a Wildland Fire Fighter. In September 2003 (maybe the second week of that month) I was dispatched with 22 other people to the Del Loma Fire in the Shasta/Trinity Forest area, the Northern part of California. Each Crew had about 20 people, our plane that left Albuquerque held 2 crews. For almost the whole two weeks, we were all on standby. On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire. It was close to sun down when, a couple of guys were amazed at something. I heard them from inside my tent, but just ignored the whole thing until one of my crew members came and pulled me out of my tent. <BR><BR>I had no idea what I was supposed to be looking at or for. He pointed across the river and I was in shock when he pointed out the biggest, hairiest mammal I had ever seen just walking along the river side minding his own business. It stopped and looked at us. The way he stood on his hind legs was like an ordinary human. He had dark, long hair and stood about 7ft tall with a muscular build. <BR><BR>At this point I was the 4th person standing there in amazement.

It was late afternoon when we noticed a strong odor that we thought might be elk so we headed east toward a small ridge hoping to find one on the other side.  As we got closer we heard the noise of rocks being banged together.  As we topped the ridge we saw a large dark brown animal squatting at the edge of a dry creek bed with it''s back toward us. It was banging 2 rocks together with it''s \"hands\" and making a grunting/growling noise each time the  rocks hit.<BR><BR>It seemed to sense our presence almost immediately and turned around and looked at us.  Then it quickly stood up and jumped across the creek in one motion.  I remember thinking \"nothing can move like that!\".  It ran up the slope on the north side of the creek bed at an angle and disappeared into the pine and aspen trees farther up the hill.  We could see it for about 50 feet before it was gone from sight.  It moved real quietly for something that big.<BR><BR>I estimate it''s height as 6''5''''.  It was covered with long dark brown hair that made me think of a yak.  It had a strong smell, at least there was a strong smell in the area that was like elk urine.<BR><BR>After we calmed down a bit, we went into the creek bed and found the 2 rocks which were chipped and broken.  We looked for other signs in that place but couldn''t find anything else." 1, " I was working in the northern part of New Mexico training to be a Wildland Fire Fighter. In September 2003 (maybe the second week of that month) I was dispatched with 22 other people to the Del Loma Fire in the Shasta/Trinity Forest area, the Northern part of California. Each Crew had about 20 people, our plane that left Albuquerque held 2 crews. For almost the whole two weeks, we were all on standby. On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire. It was close to sun down when, a couple of guys were amazed at something. I heard them from inside my tent, but just ignored the whole thing until one of my crew members came and pulled me out of my tent. <BR><BR>I had no idea what I was supposed to be looking at or for. He pointed across the river and I was in shock when he pointed out the biggest, hairiest mammal I had ever seen just walking along the river side minding his own business. It stopped and looked at us. The way he stood on his hind legs was like an ordinary human. He had dark, long hair and stood about 7ft tall with a muscular build. <BR><BR>At this point I was the 4th person standing there in amazement. Maybe about 5 minutes of watching him watch us, with more people coming out with flashlights (because the sun was still going down) he darted in to the trees.

dec of 97.  the location was in the sierra navada mountains about ten miles above huntington lake which is about 60 miles above fresno in central CA.  Myself and a frind were fourwheeling on light, snow covered roads at about two am. we came around a corner and we both saw something run across the road.  it had very long, shagy red hair and it was running on all fours.  something like a gorilla would when charging.  we only observed it cross the road when we apperently spooked it.  we are both outdoorsman and have seen bears and the like befor.  when it happened, we both simultaneously looked at each other said \"what the hell was that?\" and then said \"we better not tell anyone or they''ll think were crazy!\"  I can''t swear to what it was, but I''ll swear it wasn''t a bear.  this thing was the wrong color to be any kind of cat and it was to thin through the torso as compared to its overall size to be a bear and i suspect bears would have already been in hybernation.  the hair looked like it could have been 18 inches long, very shagy.  its body shape was like a giant human, not a cat or bear.  unfortunately the animal never

"http://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=1068&PrinterFriendly=True", :observed " gentlemen, here is my account of what i remember. fresno, ca. 1995. mono creek camp ground. about 12 or 14 miles above lake huntington. in the sierras. myself, my fishing pardner, and another gentleman, were all fishing a small part of the river there, it was the last weekend of the season, before they close the roads, due to snow. about 3 miles down the river, my pardner decided he had enough, and stop to nap. this other gentleman and myself pushed on, maybe 3/4 of mile from where we had left my friend. i stop to fish a pool. the other guy  dropped down to the next pool, to fish it, that is how we were working the differant areas. 1 guy would stop to fish a hole and the other would go right down below. as i was fishing my little stretch, i noticed the guy coming back up, he looked very excited and was waving for me to come there, i figured that he landed a good fish, or had seen a bear. he was almost in a frenzy, he just told me to hurry when i caught up to him he was looking over the edge of the next little drop off, i looked over and saw nothing unusual, he said it was right there, and jumped his way down to the spot, i followed, asking him what he had seen. before i could even get the words out of my mouth this smell, i cant explain to you what it was, wet, moldy, well animal, musk filled the air, nothing i have smelled ever was like this. my friend then told me that he had seen it, again before i could even ask above us i saw it, there standing no more then i would say 25 yards up the hill, was a the creature i believe to be a bigfoot. about 8 foot tall, covered in a reddish brown, and some what black hair, the face i remember it looking almost humanoid in appearance. it then turned and began taking huge strides up the mountain, not running, but covering some serious ground.on 2 feet. not 4. i tried to follow it, but again i felt an almost hynotic sensation over take me, and my pardner later told me he felt the same way, and  i couldnt move, we watched it go right up to the top and over it. i felt very over whelmed, and did not say anything to my friend, we just walk in a silence back to our other friend, he could tell we were shooken up. but never let him in on what had just occured. to this day, when ever i think about it, i get overwelmed with emotion. when i got home i called the gentleman and talked to him about what we had seen, the feelings we went through were basically the same, when he saw the creature he said he could smell the smell i described, but not nearly as bad as when we came down to where it had been standing. then a strange feeling over took him as well, almost like we were hypnotized, or drugged. he has trouble now remembering what he looked liked, he can remember seeing it and the smell, but all other memeories are fading. i can tell you , i will never forget what he looked like, and have came to my own conclusions, i believe the smell the bigfoot emits can be used as sort of a defense system, let me explain, i believe when excited or scared the aroma he emits can actually work on a persons system, maybe for one, it makes you feel drugged, or for another it makes you feel hypnotized or just plain scared. the reason i feel this way, is like i said to this day, when i think about it, i am over

Actually in Fresno. The area is mostly farm land and some sparse woods and vineyards. nothing like foresty though. My self, my cousin and a friend had decided to go late night fishing at a little area on the river where the river sort of pools. Their is a bridge there. It was late and we were sitting there and fishing when we heard something making noise and looked back and saw a coyote running across the bridge heading north. The coyote kept looking back as it ran as if it was frightened.The coyote looked at us but it was clearly focused on something behind it and it was scared. We thought at that time that that was odd. We then heard what we thought was a splash as if someone had dove into the water behind us. It was dark so we just glanced back but of course saw nothing. We probably sat for about 10 minutes or so when suddenly there was a huge goosh and splash about 25 yards away in front of us. We stopped fishing and then tried looking into the darkness.This small boulder throwing continued at least 2 more times before we actually saw a dark figure about 40 yards away standing what looked about waist high in the river. Their was a full moon so it wasn''t to dark to see that it was a pretty big creature. By this time we were starting to get scared and were pretty much froze in place and had began to yell at it, thinking that it could be a person. This prompted my friend to yell threats of violence as young people are sometime prone to do, this creature basically turned it''s whole body to the right of it and grapped another boulder and with both hands over its head it threw it at us, this one landed about 15 yards away. It made no sound or noise only threw small boulders. It threw about 2 more boulders the last landing about 5 yards from us enough to splash water on our faces. By this time we had reeled in our lines and were trying to get out of there as fast as we could. We ran all the way back to the car which was through some trees across a field and up a hill. We went back the next day to the area and on rafts floated to the area where the creature had stood. My friend is about 6 foot tall and jumped in the water to see about how deep it was. The water came to his shoulders. Their was no way this was a man. We even saw some of the boulders that had been thrown at the bottom of the water as it wasn''t more then 5 1/2 feet deep.

I was backpacking with two other people in California''s Sierra Nevada mountains, near the northern boundary of Kings Canyon National Park. About a year later I wrote down a very detailed description of the event. I have always wanted to report this to some appropriate organization, so now that I have found the BFRO site, here it is.<BR><BR>I was 16 at the time of the event. I am now 37. The following is a refined version of a description I wrote one year after the event.<BR><BR>I was on a backpacking trip with two family friends who were about my parent''s age. Our destination was the Devil''s Punchbowl in California''s Sierra Nevada mountains which is about a 19-mile hike on good trails from the parking lot at Courtright Reservoir. [You can find a topo map of the area at http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?z=11&n=4112372&e=335727&s=50&size=m] The first night we camped at a place called Long Meadow. The second day was a long hike to Fleming Lake (elevation about 9600 feet,) where we made camp just before sunset. Our camp was at the northeast corner of the lake, about 50 yards from the shore, up against a low, steep granite slope. We were the only people camped at that lake that evening. The two adults set about making dinner, and I went fishing at the lake since the fish were jumping vigorously. I started at the point on the lakeshore that was closest to the campsite and worked my way around the north edge of the lake towards the west. It was starting to get dark, the wind was virtually calm, and it was so quiet and peaceful that I could clearly hear occasional sounds from camp about 100 yards away: talking and the clinking of cookware. I was really focused on the fishing since I was very eager to catch something before it got too dark.<BR><BR>I was changing a lure when I heard the sound. It was a distant wailing coming from the north/northeast, up a broad open valley, to my left. Fleming Creek runs through this valley. This call is very hard to describe, but one could describe it as human- or primate-like in its smooth, round character. The call was broken up into segments that rose and fell in pitch. Each segment lasted about 1.5 seconds and each followed immediately after the one before it, like \"oooOOo, oooOOo, oooOOo\" with the pitch and volume rising in the middle of each segment and trailing off abruptly at the end. There were about six segments in the call, making the total call length about 10 seconds. The sound was somewhere between an \"oooo\" and a \"wow\" sound.<BR><BR>I froze immediately upon hearing this. It did not really scare me, but it commanded all of my attention. I heard it very clearly though it was faint and obviously far away. I would guess its origin could have been anywhere from one to two miles away, up the valley to the north/northeast. As I said it was very calm that evening and sound carries far in conditions like that. The call stopped after the first six \"oooOOo\" segments, and I immediately and very consciously decided that I was hearing things and ignored it and went back to working on my lure. Then I heard it again and there was no ignoring it. There was a total of five or six very clear, distinct calls made up of about five or six \"oooOOo\" segments each. The entire event lasted maybe 45 seconds or a minute.<BR><BR>Once the second call started I stopped what I was doing and listened very carefully as the call repeated. I was definitely not hearing things. It was not the wind, since the breeze was barely a whisper. I was in an open meadow with a lake immediately in front of me and a tree-covered granite mountain behind me. The sound was not echoing, as there was nothing for it to echo against, and the sound did not trail off as it repeated as an echo does. It started and stopped very deliberately.<BR><BR>This spooked me and I packed up all my fishing gear and went back to camp. I told the others that I had heard an animal call of some kind and asked them if they had heard anything but they had not. My guess is that the sound was masked by the noises from their own activities and the steep but low granite slope behind them. I forced myself not to think about it much, since we still had four nights to spend out there and we were headed deeper into the mountains. I did not hear, see, feel, or smell anything unusual for the rest of the trip, though I was pretty keyed up and attentive after that.<BR><BR>Regarding the quality of the sound:<BR><BR>About a month after I got back from the trip I read in John Green''s book \"On the Track of the Sasquatch\" the description of the Puyallup recordings from 1973. It describes very well the quality of the call I heard: The unidentified noise is not an \"eeeee\" scream, but more of a long \"whooOooOooOoo\" or \"whoopwhoopwhoop\" at a high pitch and with immense volume. Heard from a distance it can be compared with the sound of a siren far off but it definitely is not that. When I first read that I got chills all over and I felt a little shocked, since that is an extremely good way to describe what I heard.<BR><BR>I recently found your website and listened to all the supposed Sasquatch sound recordings, and the sound I heard could easily have been made by the same source. But the sounds on your website are mostly long wails or howls, and what I heard undulated up and down fairly rapidly. The voice itself sounded like a cross between the 1973 Puyallup sounds and the 1993 Del Norte County \"angry Bigfoot\" scream. But what I heard did not sound in the least threatening. In retrospect, it seemed as if the caller were simply announcing to everyone that it was present. Though there were multiple calls, they all seemed to come from the same source, from the same direction. I did not hear anything that sounded like an answer.<BR><BR>To my mind there is no way this could have been a person unless they were playing with an amplifier. The noise was obviously far away and I find it hard to believe anyone (short of an opera singer) could project a call like that over such a distance. There were not that many people out there anyway. Since then I have heard coyotes, owls, horses, donkeys, grouse, and other animals in the wild, and they don''t sound anything at all like what I heard. I have never to my knowledge heard a cougar, so I guess that is a possibility. I have heard that there could have been elk in that area, but I have listened to several elk bugles on the Web, and none of them are remotely like what I heard. Those elk recordings sound like someone trying to make a sound on a saxophone for the first time (dry and squawking), and what I heard had a very smooth \"primate\" quality.<BR>", :environment "High Sierra conifer forest, near the treeline.

I was dreaming I was trying to sleep but there was noise outside so in my dream I got out of bed and went to my window and pulled back the curtain.  I started tapping on the window to let whoever was outside know they were being noisy and disrupting my effort to try to sleep.   After my third tap on the window, I woke up from my dream and realized I had to go to the bathroom.  I got up and made my way to the toilet.  My bedroom window was open and my bathroom window was open.  Just before I flushed, I heard a faint noise, and I started to think it was a motorcycle coming around the bend on the highway, and in that second I thought to myself Who would be riding a motorcycle this early in the morning?. Then, the noise got louder and drawn out, and had a deep vibrating howl, and then it stopped.  I realized then that it was something I have never heard before and it was not human.  It sounded like it was on one of the mountains behind my house.  <BR><BR>Afterwards, I noticed there were no dogs barking, not even my dogs, and there werent even any crickets.  It was dead silence outside.  I was telling myself, oh my god, did I just hear what I think I heard?  I headed back to bed and noticed the clock said 3:33am. I asked my husband if he was awake. He had been snoring when I was in the bathroom.  I told him I had just heard something.  I explained the sound to him and I said I think it was a Bigfoot.  I could not believe what I had heard.  I could not sleep for over an hour, and we laid in bed waiting for more howling but there was none.  <BR><BR>The next day when I told everyone in the house, nobody had heard it.  Later Sunday morning, I used my cell phone to google different animal sounds to try to find the same howl I heard.  I tried Mountain lion, Wolf, Fisher, Fox, and none of them are in the least bit similar.  Then, I googled Bigfoot howls.  Oh my god! The 1994 Ohio Moaning Howl is almost exactly what I heard.  I got chills when I listened to it.  I played the recording to my household, and my oldest adult son recognized the sound also.  He as well as a few of his friends have had a few experiences too, including a rock being thrown at him. He has the rock in his bedroom.  I phoned my other family members and told them what I experienced and my mom told me that there was a post on facebook about a week earlier from someone that lives a few blocks away from me.  She was returning home late at night near the local dump (between Hoopa and Willow Creek, California).  Apparently, she thought she saw something near the highway and so did the car behind her as the other car turned around and drove back.   This location is only a couple of mountains away from where my home is located.  I figure the Bigfoot traveled to Hoopa from the dump site.   <BR><BR>I have lived in this area (Weitchpec and Hoopa, CA) almost my entire life and I have never, ever heard such a howl.  I think about the experience daily, but I actually feel fortunate to have witnessed this rare creature howling.  <BR><BR>Debbie Bailey<BR>", :environment "Mountainous area with brush and trees.", :fixed_year "2021", :run_time "2022-05-20 16:14:24.000000"} {:nearestroad "South bound Highway 101", :date "23", :locationdetails "[Investigator Notes: Longitude / Latitude:40.035268, -123.787606]", :submitted_date "2021-01-23", :sketch 0, :bfroid 67556, :otherwitnesses nil, :run_id 34, :nearesttown "Garberville, Ca", :timeandconditions "Time was about 2015 hrs.

Being from Alabama, I figured seeing these big redwoods would be kind of cool. <BR><BR> So, I got off of Hwy 101 and took the Avenue of the Giants exit.

I had talked to two local fishermen about what was in these rivers, and what to use. Im from the south and this area was like a new world.  So I made my way down to the river along the side of the bank.  At times the going got a little hard but I managed.  I tried several places but the water was moving too fast, so I thought that I would try and find a slack part of the river, where the flow was a little slower.  Now these woods are a lot different than the ones I was used to, so I was a little excited about this new area.<BR><BR> I had been walking for maybe 45 minutes and covered maybe two miles when I saw something in the distance.

But, I started feeling a little uneasy due to an earlier encounter, plus it might have been a bear. <BR><BR>But, being the idiot that I am, I had to get closer.  I got to within about 75 yards, because I was using the tree line as cover. That was as close as I wanted to get.  You could say that my heart was beating out of my chest it was like I had buck fever.  Well now that I was within good sight of the creature. It was easy to see what it was.  It finally stood up, and I didnt know up until that point how big it really was.  <BR><BR>Now, I had a roommate who was 6''7 and this creature would have easily stood over him.  At the best guess I would have to say that it was 7''6 tall, and it had to weigh over 400lbs.  It finally turned to me and made me out in a second, but when it turned, it didnt run away instantly.  It just stood there.  I guess it was trying to see what I was. We must have looked at each other for 10 seconds or so, but it felt like 10 minutes. And in that time all I could see was that the creature had dark reddish brown hair, and the arms easily hung down to the creatures knees. <BR><BR>But within an instant something spooked it.

The first night we stayed at Onion Lake on Onion Mountain located on forest service road 13NO1. We spent all afternoon setting up camp, takeing pictures and looking around Onion Lake for Sasquatch evidence. Around 9 p.m, just as it got dark, we heard a loud grunt roar down from a hill top just above our camp. The grunt we heard can only be described as something exhaling a great amount of air all at onece. The grunt was very loud, very rough and only lasted for a second. My brother turned to me and said,\"WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT\"? At that moment a deer ran down the hill from the direction of the grunt and into our camp. Then out of the darkness, another grunt roared through the forest from our right at a distance we thought was about 100-150 yards out from our camp. Then we heared a grunt that strait out from our camp that was at least 400-500 yards out. Then we heared the grunt from up on top of the hill again. Then the grunt to our right answered the grunt on top of the hill and then we heared the grunt that was out 400-500 yards answer the grunt on top of the hill and the grunt to our right. It was as if what ever it was makeing these sounds were communicating back and forth to one another. This grunting was very intense for the fist hour or so then it calmed down a little through out the rest of the night. The last grunt we heared was around 5 a.m just before first light. At one time around 10 p.m, we heared a loud grunt come from behind us over by Onion Lake. I turned on my three miliion candle spot light and searched the forest in the direction we heared the grunt but saw nothing. That grunt could not of been no more than 100 yards away from us and was very loud and rough. Around that same time the other grunts seemed to getting closer to our camp as well and we were starting to get scared. We huddled together in the middle of our camp with our rifles and shotguns in hand along with our three million candle spot light in hand ready to take on what ever it was makeing these loud grunts. We were hearing something we had never heard before in the woods and what ever it was, it sounded like it was VERY BIG by the sound of the grunts these things were makeing. We were scared. If it was not for the firearms we took with us we would of thrown all of our camping gear into our vehicle and we would''ve left a dust cloud a half mile high and twenty miles long as we were getting the heck out of there. We got up the next morning and looked around a little but we did''nt see or hear anything. What ever it was makeing these grunts, they were nocturnal animals and they were only active at night. We could also tell the animals were moveing around in the forest from grunt to grunt. Example: the grunts would get loud and would come from a specific location in the woods and then the next grunt would come from the same general location but a little to the right or left and a little closer or further away than tha grunt before. But we never did hear anything walking through the dry under brush. What ever they were makeing these grunts, they move through the woods very quietly with no sound at all except for their grunts. We packed our camping equipment into our vehicle and we spent the next night down at Louse Camp on Bluff Creek. That night we had no visitors and we returned home to Eureka the next morning. About one month after we returned from our expedition to Onion Lake and Bluff Creek, I was watching a show on the Discovery Channel about Ball Pythons in India. A large fifteen foot snake was crawling on the ground in the jungle as a family of monkeys were going crazy at the sight of the snake. These monkeys looked alot like Chimpanzees but the had black faces and black fur. At one moment, a large male monkey made a loud grunt as he threw a stick at the snake. The grunt was very loud, very rough and only lasted for a second. I came flying off the coutch and said to myself,\"thats what we heared at Onion Lake\". The grunt the monkey made at the snake on the Discovery Channel was the same tone, roughness, length and sounded exactly like the grunt we heared the night of July 5, 2004 at Onion Lake. The Sasquatch is thought to be a large primate of somekind and my brother and I heared loud grunts comeing out the forest at Onion Lake. These grunts I later heared a monkey make on T.V in India. The monkeys grunts were identical to the grunts we heared at Onion Lake. I''m not a scientist or expert on grunts, but I think this is very interesting. My brother and I were raised here in Humboldt County, California and have lived here in the heart of Bigfoot country all our lives. We have been interested in the Sasquatch/Bigfoot for as long as we can remember and we plan on makeing other Bigfoot expeditions in the future because the sounds we heared comeing out of the woods at Onion Lake on the night of July 5, 2004 makes us wonder even more now about whats really out there.", :environment "Mountain Ridge with large Douglas Fir Trees.

We stopped at the Aikens Creek campground (West of Orleans, CA and just west of Bluff Creek on HWY 96) at approximately 6:00pm, as it was too late to hike in anywhere that evening and the Six Rivers NF website listed it as one of the campgrounds open through November. As we neared the pay station a sign deferred us to render payment directly to the campground host, and as we approached the host''s site it became clear that the site was vacant with just a few small items left behind. So, we took the liberty to drive in and explore the portion of the campground that was open. Driving near the Southern edge (nearest to the Klamath river) we smelled a pervasive \"skunky\" odor, but thought nothing of it at the time.<BR><BR>Eventually we pulled into a campsite (second or third from the entrance at the foot of a large hill). Our intent was to get out of the pickup (leaving the dog inside), get on our rain gear and set up the tent as quickly as possible, as it was already quite dark and raining. Just after donning my rain gear, however, I heard some distinct \"hoots\" from within the woodline which were decidedly not owl-like nor quite human-like, but could be most accurately likened to those of an ape. I asked my friend if he had heard that, but he had not, as he had two hoods pulled up over his head. I quickly scanned the woodline with my head lamp, seeing nothing out of the ordinary through the dark and rain. We began setting-up the tent when I heard it again. \"There.\" I said, \"Did you hear it that time?\"<BR><BR>\"No.\" he responded, but he did pull his hoods down. Shortly thereafter we both heard another set of \"hoots\".<BR><BR>\"What do you think that is?\" he asked.<BR><BR>I have had a casual interest in the Sasquatch phenomenon since childhood and find its existence to be scientifically plausible. I am also quite comfortable in the wilderness, having spent much of my life in the outdoors from Alaska to Costa Rica professionally, academically and recreationally, but I never honestly expected to experience anything first-hand with such a creature. So, being educated and reasonable, I declined to respond.<BR><BR>As we continued, we began hearing other noises. First we heard \"whacking\" sounds of wood against wood (more probably stick against tree). Perceiving this \"hooting\" and \"whacking\" as a less-than-friendly display, we became a little nervous and contemplated leaving; but curiousity and the dread of packing up, moving to an unplanned location and reconstructing in the dark, while already soaked; compelled us to stay. So, we continued constructing the tent between periodic scans of the area.<BR><BR>The \"whacking\" continued and we noticed it would come from different locations in short sequence (too short for one individual to move from point A to point B). Again my friend asked: \"What do you think that is?\"<BR><BR>I gave the guarded response: \"I''ll tell you what, I''ve spent alot of time in the woods and observed alot  of animals, but I''ve never heard anything like this.\" I assume he read through the evasion to the meaning of my response, given the ubiquitous usage of the word \"Bigfoot\" , and images thereof, in the surrounding communities and some casual conversation we had had on the subject during our drive.<BR><BR>Shortly before turning in for the evening, I heard a short series of what sounded like heavy footsteps on the rocky terrain of the hillside, in the rhythm of a two-legged walk. Turn in we did, however, with senses piqued and dog tucked securely within the tent. We slept intermittently and restlessly hearing sounds throughout the night.  Most frequently we heard the \"whacking\"; most regularly a rather hollow-sounding report originating from a point some distance to our Northeast and up the hill. We would, however, periodically hear closer and clearer \"whacks\" from varying locacations to our general Southeast; once hearing a disturbingly close and firm \"whack\" from our South/Southwest. <BR><BR>I awoke, once, at approximately 3:00am and heard distinct, single-note \"whistles\" from the general direction of the distant, hollow \"whacking\" which were, again, decidedly unbirdlike, yet not quite human. Soon thereafter we were all startled upright by a \"crack\" followed by loud rockslide, terminating distressingly close to our location. My friend informed me he had heard two other, smaller slides earlier that night. After all was quiet for some time (except the perpetual \"whacking\") we eventually slumbered down again, awakening to sunlight and (finally) quiet surroundings.<BR><BR>In the daylight we observed that the hillside was quite steep, rocky and slightly parabolic in shape, and the rock slide ended up in our South adjacent campsite, leading us to conclude that: 1. Inspection of the hillside would be dangerous and turn up little or nothing in the way of footprints; 2. Sounds could have originated from well up the hill and carried down the \"amphitheater\" hillside; 3. If it were people playing a prank, they must be extremely dedicated to risk their lives negotiating that hill in the dark and rain and to wait in the woods any given night for the off-chance campers might come by in November; 4. Though rock slides may naturally occur there on occasion, they certainly must not occur on the order of three a night or someone would implement measures to ensure no one camp in that location; 5. Maybe that \"skunky\" smell we had encountered just previously was not a skunk.<BR><BR>At any rate we drove on the next morning to the Willow Creek Ranger''s Office (making no mention of the events) to inquire as to open trails. We were instructed that much of the back country road system (and corresponding trails) was closed due to the Port-Orford Cedar Root disease, but that we could drive into the Horse Linto Creek area and hike along the closed roads. We took that advice and spent the next five nights uneventfully.<BR><BR>We decided to return to Aikens Creek for the final night (Saturday, Nevember 22)  to take advantage of the open, flat space to dry wet equipment and see if we could observe anything further. We picked an open site midway between the foot of the hill and the highway, layed out equipment for drying, then decided to day-hike somewhere nearby. We drove up Bluff Creek Road to its closure at the road junction to Fish Lake then hiked 1.6 miles down that road.  I payed close attention to the steep clay roadsides, and once noticed what could have been a partial footprint of a large, humanlike foot from the heel (about 4\" in width) to a point about 6\" forward (and perceivably midway along the length of the foot. I found, however, no other footprints or enough context to draw any real conclusion about the impression.<BR><BR>That night, back at the campground, we kept a large campfire and kept some down and dead cedar boughs nearby to throw in for quick brightness if needed. At one point , my dog suddenly barked and charged towards the trees at the edge of the campground just  below the freeway. I halted him and went to investigate, but found nothing unusual. Though better prepared we neither saw nor heard anything further that night. We returned home however with a new awareness.", :environment "Mountainous, steep, rocky terrain.

At this point, this side of the mountain, that I was on, was bald and it was open ground with no trees or brush close by to hide behind.<BR><BR>Suddenly, I had this very bad feeling. Then the hair on the back of my neck stood up straight up!  I never had that happen to me before or since.  I believe this happened for no other reason except fear.  I then left this out of stride trail. Actually, I ran off the trail feeling terrified of something that was coming down this same trail.  I only got a short way off, when I went down on my knees and covered my face and eyes with both hands and tried to hide. At that moment I heard an animal on two legs come down the trail, a few yards from me, it stop and it had to gaze right at me for awhile, then it continued on down the hill.  I didn''t look until after it left and continued on down the mountain out of sight. So, I never saw this animal.

There was no odor or smell, and the only odd thing was that the trail became fainter, as I continued to climb on up this mountain.

It was about 1000 feet wide and 1200 feet long.   On the edges were fir and oak trees that developed  a thick cover.

About ten minutes into this show, Jeff asked me to try and find another location where the reception might be a little better.   A commercial was playing at the time so I quickly contacted the upper team and Manny and told then that I had to move.   I started my vehicle and drove about 600 feet towards the tree line.  I reconnected to the show and was relived that it was a better connection.   <BR><BR>I was in this new location less than 15 feet to the tree line, with visibility not over 5 feet into the trees.   I was parked for a few minutes and heard what I thought was a bear charging me (I am in a convertible) with the window down, not much protection in anyone&#8217;s mind.     I looked for my revolver and it was gone, I must have forgot it with Manny when I was in a hurry to get into a better location!   I sat there for a second, and again I heard this charging, that sounded like a few feet away from me.   This time I started my car got on the radio and told the upper team that I was moving out because of something charging me in the bush.   (Manny didn&#8217;t have a radio, as we were together at base camp and had to share two, one for base and one for the upper team).<BR><BR>I asked the upper team &#8220;do you see anything&#8221; and they replayed no.   I decided to wait it out, as this thing could expose itself to me (although I just realized that my camera was also with Manny).<BR><BR>The show continued on and I would hear footfalls, breaking branches and at least one grunt growl.   I kept asking the upper team if they could see anything and they kept saying no.    I at least had a flashlight, but didn&#8217;t want to use it in fear that I would scare off whatever it was. <BR><BR>Obviously I was becoming very concerned for my safety, not knowing what it was.   But I remained there on a chance I might be able to see a Bigfoot or at least see something.   I heard the charging again and again and finally a crackle in the radio  &#8220;John it&#8217;s looking right at you, can&#8217;t you see it, it&#8217;s about 25 feet away, that ****** is huge&#8221;.   My heart started pounding FAST, and trying to carry on with this live program without sounding distracted was even harder.   <BR><BR>The other upper team member confirmed what they were looking at, it was something that was at least 8 feet tall with shoulders that were 4 feet across.   As I sat in my car, cell phone to one ear, and the other to the forest, I could hear it charge again, and that&#8217;s when they would say, &#8220;it went back into the trees&#8221;, this happened several times.  This sighting went on for several minutes, with the Squatch looking at me by moving its body from side to side trying to get a better look through the trees and brush.   It was also observed moving its arms in a quick motion as if signaling to others.<BR><BR>This whole incident from the first charge heard to the last tree branch breaking, lasted about 30 minutes.   It was by far the one of the most intense moments in my life.<BR><BR>That next day we did search the area and found the soil disturbed where this Squatch was spotted.  Due to the soil condition, it did not allow any prints to be left.   Judging from a tree and stump in the area, it was determined that it was at least eight feet tall but closer to nine feet.   From the Squatches point of view, it had several windows to look at me, and by moving its body from side to side it would have a clear view of my entire vehicle and me.<BR><BR><BR>You can listen to this event by going to sightings.com and clicking on archived shows.

We broadcast the alleged Sasquatch \"screams\" and \"howls\" throughout the next few days, including the Bluff Creek Road areas.<BR><BR>Note: Before leaving the truck at the locked Forest Service gate, the Fish Lake Road, and hiking to Fish Lake, we broadcast two calls of each sound, the \"scream\" and the \"howl\". Coincidentally, our encounter occurred that same evening.<BR><BR>At approximately 9:30 p.m., we were in the process of setting up our second tent (there were six of us in the party), and maintaining the campfire when from directly across the road and meadow we heard a type of \"whistle\" or double \"whoop\" (try whistling these syllables \"WEEOOOU, WEEOOOU\") and it was immediately followed by a very intense \"screech\", which I could only compare to a bear cub in danger combined with the intensity of a hawk shriek. One of our younger members (15) insists it sounded like a possessed woman! <BR><BR>Now, I grew up in the mountains of Montana, am familiar with many animals and their sounds, and have never heard anything like this in my life. And until this moment, I have wondered what it was like to have the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. I have never felt this kind of reaction, I repeat -- NEVER. <BR><BR>The sound sequence repeated itself again, followed by a third lone screech. Immediately, we panned the forest/tree line with our flashlights with the intent of at least seeing the reflection of an animal''s eyes. NOTHING. We must have lighted the area for nearly ten minutes following the sound and still saw nothing. As time wore on, we began to relax and go about our business of finishing the tent set-up and dinner. <BR><BR>Then at about 12:30 a.m. (just past midnight, with two of the teenagers already asleep), we again heard the \"whistle - whoop\" immediately followed by the \"screech\", but this time directly BEHIND our camp site up the slope near the picnic areas amongst the trees. Again, we panned the area with lights (I broke out the 2,000,000 candlepower gangbuster spotlight and lit the night ) and still, NOTHING. No movement, no eyes, nothing. After panning around the entire area once again, I noticed movement on the road towards the restrooms and we quickly moved the light in that direction. Walking across the road was a tiny little grey fox, or kit fox. Well, for our needs, that was our mystery animal. (We THOUGHT). We figured it yelped and then made that raucous screech for some other reason. Funny, but that was enough confirmation for us and we went to bed for the night.<BR><BR>At approximately 5:30 a.m., three of us woke at the same time and after a minute or two of silence we again heard the \"whistle - whoop\" followed immediately by the intense \"screech\" and this followed again by a lone \"screech\". But, this time the sound was only about 20 feet from our tent as if it was standing directly on the paved road next to our camp site. We were all unnerved somewhat, but agreed it''s just that darn kit fox again, and didn''t bother to jump out with the video cameras or spotlights. I exchanged words with a person in the other tent (not sure if this \"chased\" it away), but we then heard the same \"whistle\" and \"screech\" again, but far off in the distance as if it were a quarter-mile away. This was the end of our encounter.<BR><BR>The following morning we checked the area for any signs of tracks and found nothing. We also nearly walked the entire circumference of the lake shore searching for signs of any kind and [got] nothing. Please note that we did not HEAR any movement in the brush or any footsteps. We did not SEE any movement or eyes of any kind and we did not SMELL anything at all. After hiking out of Fish Lake the next day, and driving back to the coast, we just didn''t feel right with our \"kit fox\" explanation. It just didn''t sit right with us. The sound was just too intense. Then, upon discussing the incident with John Freitas that same evening, he agreed with the idea that foxes almost NEVER even make sounds, much less something as nerve-wracking as that of the night before. <BR><BR>On our trip back south, we stopped for a break and found a poster-type map discussing the numerous Bigfoot sightings and locations and in the accompanying paragraph it stated that \"... sounds associated with bigfoot encounters include whistles and shrieks similar to that of a mountain lion.\" We welcome your feedback on discussing these sounds.", :environment "Lake shore Forest Service campground (our site approximately 150 yards from shore), paved roads throughout, surrounded by thickly-wooded Northern California pine forests.

But, I wanted to catch another steele before the river blew out so, I drove down to the river bar as described in the \"Where did it occur?\" section of this report.  <BR><BR>I parked about 30 yards away from the rivers edge, on a dirt road surrounded by dense willows.  I turned off the car and opened the door.  Immediatly I heard two bellows that seemed far off.  I initially thought it was local kids.  The best I can do to discribe the noise is to ask you to try and make it--- put your lips togeather as if to make the sound of a \"B\" then bellow \"Whoooooooop\", wait two seconds and do it again. This is what I heard.  <BR><BR>To this day I can physically emulate the soud. The sound was similar to the bugle of a bull elk.  I used to work as a horse patrol park ranger on the eastern slope of the Rockies in Rocky Mountain National Park, I kept visitors away from the elk.  In addition, I have frequently heard elk bugle near Oric, CA. I know the bugle of an elk.  That''s not what this was.  <BR><BR>Well, I didn''t think much of it so I got my wadders on and proceeded to the rivers edge.  I wadded in up to my thigh and began fishing moving slowly down stream.  The river was probably about fifty yards wide and nearly at bank full about ten minutes went by and I noticed a dark figure down stream an accross the river, seemingly standing behind a large root wad.  I could see what I though was a head and shoulders of a bear or something? It was drizzeling and I couldn''t focus on it at first, I wasn''t sure it was an animal I thought it might just be part of the root wad.  <BR><BR>As I fished down stream I worked my way dirrectly accross from it and looked at it again, I looked right into its eyes, they were dark, it didn''t move. I then saw another to its left, I could see its body from <BR>the thigh up, it didn''t move, it was looking slightly down stream and I couldn''t see its eyes.  <BR><BR>These things looked taller than a man, had flat faces and large round eyes, their shoulders were broad and their arms were long, they were mostly covered in hair although the one on the left seemed to have bald spots on its chest area, like mange.  They stood still, never once moved.  Ikept fising and tried to work down stream of them to a tailout wher I could cross and sneek up on them to get a closer look, the river was to high.  <BR><BR>As I worked back upstream I noticed a cacoon shaped object perched on the root wad overhanging the rivers edge.  It was shaped like a foot ball but was probably 4 feet long and 21/2 feet in diameter (hard to tell at 50 yards).  This cacoon like thing appeared to be neetly wrapped in dry grasses like cat tail or pampas grass blades.  I kept fishing moving upstream of them back toward my car, at one point I looked back to get another look anfd the cacoon like thing and the animals were gone.  A day later I drove to the other side of the river to go see if I could track um but the river had flooded the entire area.  <BR><BR>I don''t follow Big Foot stuff, but I do know no bones have ever been found.  As a scintist this encounter has stimulated me to develope a theory.. I theorize that they warn eachother with this BWhooooop sound, and that the reason we have never found their bones is that they cleverly dispose of them by waiting till the rivers are on the rise, packaging the bones, and putting them in the rivers close to their mouths so that they wash out to sea.  I''m not sure I belive in any of this but thats what I saw and heard and thats my theory.  My second theory is that it was an elaborate hoax preformed by somm sort of Big Foot fan club or somthing.

It!! started what seemed to be a good distance off in the thick forest and then moved rapidly closer. What startled me was the speed at which the source of the sound traveled.

This smell was so strong that it seemed that it had to be right in front of your face. We figured it was coming from a particular stand of trees and decided to walk up and behind this stand to see if we could still smell it.<BR><BR>When we got behind the stand we couldn''t smell it but when we got back around down-wind of the stand we heard something take off downhill and down-wind of us. All we saw was swaying brush where it had gone crashing down the mountain side. Some of the guys wanted to chase it but I convinced them that since it had left that we should leave it alone if it left us alone. Well ... in 15 minutes the smell was back. This time everybody in camp grabbed a gun ... we had a lot of guns and decided to chase this smelly thing down. Except for me and 2 others. I just had a flashlight. Well ... they chased this thing out of the aforementioned stand of trees and could hear it and smell it but could not see it. We could hear it stomping and thrashing around behind the stand of trees. They chased it up a narrow trail that led to a spring.<BR><BR>I was bringing up the rear but only had the flashlight so I went back to camp with the other 2 that had remained.

At this point they decided that whatever it was had stepped off of the trail and they had run right by it. Well this freaked them out and explains their hasty retreat.<BR><BR>It was quiet the rest of the night but a couple of mornings later 2 of the guys were sleeping in a 2-man tent on a hillside above the camp and woke the rest of us at first light, yelling. When we got to the tent we found a huge turd about 18 inches from the front of the tent opening.

Perhaps it was not close enough to a sighting to publish on your site. I originally said that the incident occurred at Mcgee Creek. I was incorrect. It was Deadman''s Creek. It was Summer. I believe the year was 1970. I was 12 years old or so. My friend and I belonged to the Western Conservation Club and went on many outings with the group. We would work at an area (cleaning it up and restoration) half our stay and play the other half.<BR><BR>My friend and I decided that we were going to walk way up the creek to go fishing. More to get away from the adults than anything else. It was mid-afternoon when we started out. The area had very few trails, once you left the immediate camping area. We headed out cross-country staying as close to the creek as possible looking for good fishing holes. We had walked about five miles up the creek towards the mountains when we both got the feeling that we were being watched. We both looked at each other and called each other light-weights and kept on going.<BR><BR>We fished for awhile, by now it was late afternoon. We noticed that there were none of the usual sounds that you hear in a forest such as birds, etc. We still had that feeling of being watched. The sky was starting to look threatening as an afternoon storm was heading down the canyon / creek towards us.<BR><BR>We started back to camp when the storm caught us and lightning started. A bolt of lightning struck the ground on the other side of the creek and up a ways from our location. Directly afterwards, we heard a growling or grunting sound from the area of the strike. We heard the sound of branches breaking in the brush. The sound was moving up the creek away from us and up the mountain. The breaking branches sounded as if they were high up in the trees. The trees in the area are conifers and the dead branches started about six or more feet up the trees from ground level -- so whatever was breaking the branches, it had to be pretty tall.<BR><BR>The object was moving fast because it was soon out of hearing distance. You know as well as I that sound travels a long way in the woods and we were in a canyon so the object was really moving. We never noticed a foul odor or saw anything conclusive. I did, however, see a large shadow moving through the woods briefly.<BR><BR>Please understand that although we were very young we had a lot of experience in the back country. We knew what the indigenous animals looked like, their habits and the sounds that they make. This growling did not sound like anything that I ever heard before or since. I know that this will sound funny but a person knows when things are not quite right and this was not right. Just a feeling.<BR><BR>We could not return to the area to look for footprints as the lightning strike caused a fire and the camp site was evacuated by the USFS. At the time I had heard about bigfoot, but only up north. I was unaware of local sightings until recently. This thing was not a bear. I thought that at the time. I tried to make it a bear so I could put the incident out of mind, but it just doesn''t add up that it was a bear unless this bear was huge, walking erect and hauling ass.

My father also grew up there. He was born in Klamath Falls, Oregon, but grew up in the eastern SF Bay Area.  He has a BS in Forestry, A Masters in Zoology, and A PHD in Entomology, and worked as a research scientist with the U.S. Forest Service.  For most of his 20-30 years of service, my father did research on insects that predate timber harvest species in California and Oregon.  When he did his research (usually in the summer and fall) my younger brother and I would accompany him into the woods.  My father was and is a great woodsman, a hunter and fisherman, who taught my brother and myself all about the forests and what types of plants and animals lived there.  My father was also a man of science and this is important to note as will become evident later.<BR><BR>At the end of each summer season, my family and some other forestry families would get together and take several weeks of vacation.  Most often, we would load canoes and float down the lower 15-30 miles of the Klamath River to its mouth.  My father and I would fly fish for steelhead in the riffles during mornings and evenings and we would spend the hot hours of the day canoeing, exploring, resting, etc. These trips would often take one to two weeks to complete.  During one of these trips (probably in 1969 or 1970, I was about 8-9 years old I think...) we made camp on the river bar at the mouth of Tek-Tah creek.  There was a good flat bar there, and at that time of year, the creek was flowing under the sand and apeared dry. One afternoon, while everyone else was napping, my father and I took a walk up the creek bed to see if the creek was flowing on the surface somewhere inland.  About two hundred yards upsteream, the creek did come to the surface and flowed sluggishly thruogh a series of large pools. I remember my dad telling me that these pools were probably full of baby salmon and steelhead waitng for fall rains to allow them to swim down to the main river and out to sea.  My dad had a very scientific mind and he would describe natural processes in great detail when we had the patience to listen.<BR><BR>As we proceeded inland up the creek, we rounded a bend and entered a long, sandy bar on the east side of a long arching pool in the creek. As I looked across the surface of this bar, I saw a set of tracks in the soft sand. These tracks caught my attention because they were very large, and the space between them seemed very long, like if I laid down next to them, they would almost be further apart than the legth of my body.  The tracks also seemed to sink alot deeper into the sand than the footprints of my dad, who is pretty big (6'',2\"). The tracks began at the water''s edge at the lower end of the bar, and proceeded diagonally across the bar in a straight line to the far end of the bar.  <BR><BR>My father had never told me any stories about bigfoot  (he would deny the existence of any animal that was \"unknown\" until science recognized it anyhow) and to my knowledge, I had not heard of any such animal at that time, nor had I any thing more than a passing interest in these types of things then, but these tracks...thier size, gait, and the way they led across the bar in a strieght line...they made a funny impression on me.  My father was also very interested in the tracks, he asked me please not to walk near or in them, then asked me to sit down while he spent several minutes comparing his foot size to them, and trying to match thier spacing by walking next to them.  He seemed very tense, as if he sensed something, or was trying to figure something out.  Eventually, I got bored of sitting and got up and followed him. When I finally caught up with him, we were half-way up the bar.  He had stopped looking at the tracks and was instead looking intently at the timber ahead and at the southern edge of the bar.  He was very quiet and tense.  I have never seen my father frightened or worried about anything before, or since for that matter, but watching him the way he scanned the surrounding forest so intently, made me very nervous and excited.  I broke the silence and began to ask him what he thought made the tracks and what was he trying to see in the trees...He turned around, almost jumping a little in suprise, and told me to be quiet.  then he looked around some more, and started back towards the camp with a qick pace, grabbing me by the hand, and saying these are the tracks of a big bear, son, and we should leave this area alone from now on.  Then he told me not to come up the creek alone, and not to tell Mama or my brother or any of the others anything about what we saw, that it might worry them or something, and that he would speak no more of this matter.  Just like that!  <BR><BR>Well the older I get the funnier that incident and those tracks seem to me. I have hunted for many years and have seen and tracked many animals in the woods since that time, and have never seen anything like that since.  I am thirty eight now, and my father has retired. I asked my father about this incident last year, and he was silent and pensive for a long time, then he told me that he does''nt remember this time or seeing anything other than bear tracks. I don''t know what we really saw that day, but I do know that it scared my dad, and he has never ever spoken to me the way he did on that day, or behaved that way since.

Sometime during the night I was awakened by a huffing sound.  I woke one of the other boys up and we listened to something slowly working its way all around the outside of the cabin.  We woke up the three others and all listened.  Whatever it was outside was poking at the old rotted boards around the bottom of the shack.  We could hear it shuffle around and pry at some of the boards.  Finally it moved around to the front door, which was only about five feet high and Butch got my old .22 rifle and said, \"Open the door!\"  I did not want to open the door but did anyway.  Whatever it was, was standing right in front of the opening but because it was dark, all we could see were hairy legs.  Butch fired the .22 and this thing screamed and spun around and took off.

My friend and I were bear hunting up in Humboldt County on the Hoopa Indian Reservation. It was in March or April. Back then bear hunting was open all year long in Humboldt County, and there were no limits. We were from Southern California, and were totally unfamiliar with the area. We stopped in a town on the Trinity river, I believe the name of the town may have been Willow Creek, I''m not sure. Anyway we met some Indians in town, and asked them, if they knew of any good places to hunt bear. They said they didn''t, but added, that there was an old man in the grocery store who may be able to help us. The Indians pointed to an old blue 1950 Buick parked in front of the store, and told us that the car belonged to the old man, so we waited there until he came out. When he came back to his car, we introduced ourselves, and asked him if he knew of any good places to hunt bear. He told us it was pretty good up on the Hoopa Reservation, and gave us some general directions. We ended up on an old deserted dirt road high in the mountains in my friends dads 1949 (4) door Chevy. We kept going up until we hit snow, started to fishtail, and the right rear wheel went over the side. We set the hand brake and got out of the car to evaluate the situation. We decided to get the bumper jack out of the trunk, and jack the car up, and then push it off of the jack back on the road. The plan worked and all 4 wheels were back on the road. We backed down the road until we came to a place where we could turn around. By now it was dusk, and we decided we had better pitch our tent before it got too dark. At the turn around spot next to the road we saw a big pine tree and decided to set up camp under the tree. By the time we pitched the (4) man umbrella tent it was dark. We put all of our sleeping gear and firearms in the tent and lied down, and were talking for about ten minutes, when we heard the first grunt outside the tent. We both pretended that we didn''t hear anything and kept talking. Then it did it again, and this time we both stopped, and I asked my friend if he heard that. He said he did, and also heard it the first time. I said yeah, me too. Now, we both shut up and listened. We could hear it circling the tent, because the ground was covered with bark, and we could hear the bark crunching under its feet. We could also hear its very loud breathing. By the sound of its footsteps and its breathing, we figured whatever this was, it was huge and it was walking on (2) feet. It circled the tent several times, and we decided that one of us should go out and see what it was. Niether of us wanted to go out, because we were scared, so we decided to flip a coin to see which one of us would go. My friend lost. I then suggested that before he went out, it may be wise, to fire the 44 mag out of the tent flap first. He concurred, and stuck the barrel out of the flap and fired 5 shots. We then both went out, he had the 44, and I held the light. We looked all over and didn''t see a thing. We went back in the tent, laid down, and were  trying to figure out what had just been outside of the tent. We had never heard of sasquatch. We had been talking for about 5 or 10 minutes when we heard a very loud high pitched scream, that lasted for about 5 seconds, and sounded like it was about 50 to 100 yards away. We looked at each other and asked, what the heck was that? That was one heck of a scream. We talked a little longer and then went to sleep. The rest of the night was un-eventful. We arose the next morning and went outside, and looked around the circumference of the tent for footprints. We couldn''t see any, because the ground was covered, with many years accumulation of bark from the huge pine tree we were camped under. We had wondered many times, what it was, that had been outside our tent that night and often talked about it. Then one day several years later, I happened to be in the barber shop, getting a haircut.

My name is J. C. and I am a 41 year old Vice President of a bank. I have been harboring an encounter I had for 31 years secretly out of fear of ridicule or shame. But now that I have seen other people have had similar situations, I must tell my story. During September 1972, I was hiking down from a lake with my dad and my friend on a fishing trip. We were at a place called Barney Lake out of Mammoth, California, and were on our way home. After a weekend of camping and fishing we were backpacking out from the lake. I was the lead person going down the trail. I had outpaced my friend J. C. and my dad by about 4 minutes without knowing it as I was moving quickly down the trail. After about 10 to 40 minutes down the trail from Barney Lake (I can''t remember exactly after all these years) I came into a clearing. It was a small flat grassy meadow from the trees which I had been seeing downhill till then. I took a break to rest from my fast strides and looked out over the meadow. The first thing I saw was a big white rock boulder near the end of the meadow. The meadow was maybe 20 yards by 30 yards of grass. At the point of the clearing to my left I heard extreme thrashing going on. I looked over to my left to see a large animal bent over with its rear end facing me. It was only about 12 feet away from me. I saw that it was hairy and had a reddish, orange, brown multicolor mix hair to it, and most different was a rear end that was bare like a monkey''s. I knew this because at this time in my life I spent most of my lunch hours in the library reading zoology and marine biology books. I thought this was very strange because no bear could bend over at the waist and have skin over its rear end like this. In my fear I was frozen, shocked and bewildered at the same time. I had never known or heard of big foot or sasquatch at this time in my life. At this point it had been maybe 5 or 6 seconds and then the animal lifted up and stood erect. It was enormous. It must have been 8 feet tall or more, and for a 10 year old boy this was unreal. It had been scratching with its hands and grubbing and digging prior to looking for what I thought was food. Its back was to me when it stood so I could see it was built similar to a human but with a lot of hair. I knew this was no bear from my background. I also knew only black bear were seen as an almost extinct species here during this time, and would have been much smaller in height and stature. I got so scared I ran full pack towards that big white rock. I literally dove over the top, pack and all, and snuggled against the rock, so scared to even look, in case the creature heard me. Finally after about 20 seconds or so, I peeked over the rock to see nothing and no one on the trail. Within 1 or 2 minutes, my dad and John came down the trail and into the opening. I started screaming at them \"look out, look out,\" in fear that the creature was still there and would do something to them. They froze,  bewildered, looked left to where I was pointing and then back to me in confusion. They were standing at the clearing at the spot I had been at. I finally came out and walked to them and looked into the trees and thick brush only to see broken brush, twigs and some hair there. We moved on finally and I never spoke of this again except to my dad and a couple of close friends. Around 7 or 8 years late I saw a couple of bigfoot movies including the Patterson video. Once I saw this, I knew without a doubt this was what I saw. I still kept my story a secret out of fear, but this vision haunts me and will all my life. I know it was so real. I will never forget this and take it to my grave. I am now someone who needs answers and must try and find out that this creature does exist or I will not put my memory to rest.

We were walking along an old camp road that had become overgrown with brush and scrub.  <BR><BR>It was obvious that bear had been using this trail as there was a considerable amount of bear sign along the old road.  We got to a point in the trail where there was an overhang of pine limbs over a slight depression on the right side of the old road.  Upon inspecting the depression we noticed what appeared to be a left foot print, and a right leg outstretched in the pine needle cover on the ground.  We continued to survey the area, and noticed what appeared to be more tracks leading away from this overhang and depression.  I took photos with a disposable camera.  I have the prints, but they did not come out very clear.  Which was a disappointment, but something to look at nonetheless.  <BR><BR>We finished poking around, and continued on our way.  We got just a bit further down the trail, and we walked through an extremely strong smell of skunk, or wet dog-like odor.  No sooner had you smelled it that is disappeared, but if you took a few steps back it was extremely strong again.<BR><BR>I have been hunting and recreating outdoors for many years, and I am very familiar with skunk spray, and how it seems to permeate a large area.  This was not simply the spray of a skunk.  It was very centralized.  It was literally like you walked through it, and it disappeared, then you could turn around and walk through it again.  <BR><BR>The two of us spent a few moments looking around, and we noticed, something very peculiar.  In the middle of the trail and not far from this smell, and the foot prints we had seen, was a large pile of oak acorns.  The strange thing was there was not an oak anywhere near this pile of acorns!  They seemed to have been placed in this location.  They were not a collection of shells from squirrels, they were fresh dropped acorns.  Enough to hold a hungry deer, or two for a little while.<BR><BR>We theorized that whatever had been hunkered down under the pine overhang in the depression may have placed these acorns, then set up under the overhang off of the trail in ambush.<BR><BR>Our intent was to walk to the back of Pine Mountain, then still hunt our way up to the top of the mountain.  We had used this road for years to access the back of the mountain, and we were very used to the topography, so anything out of the norm would be noticeable to us.  <BR><BR>Chris and I team hunt very well together and after a short strategy chat, decided to use a 50 step method: one of us would go 50 steps, stop and whistle to let the other hunter know it was their turn to take 50 steps, and then just watch and listen.  We were approximately 130 yards apart.<BR><BR>The ground was covered in heavy and dry leaf litter so the going was somewhat noisy.  I had gone nearly three quarters of the way to the saddle at the top, and I heard what sounded like a whistle, but not the whistle I recognized as Chris''.  I also heard what sounded like a very large boulder break loose and roll down the back of the hill.  I had assumed that Chris had rolled it down hoping to kick something out, but based on the last whistle, this rock was rolled from that area, and seemed to be 60 yards to my right, when Chris would have been twice that distance away from me.  I though that maybe he had gotten closer to me as we made our way up, but that would not have been the case in the past.  We work very well together and spacing is everyhting on our team hunts.<BR><BR>We got to the top of Pine Mountain, and we had a discusion and he told me that he thought I had rolled the boulder, and vice versa.  I told him about the whistle, and he told me the exact same thing.  He also had this overwhelming feeling of being followed up the hill.  Like something was timing it''s footfalls so as to not be detected.

Having been there once before four years earlier with a church youth group, and consequently having had a blast, we wanted to camp in the same campground and generally do a lot of the things we had done on our first trip, but without the constraints of adult supervision. We where both twenty years old at this time. <BR><BR>We camped at a place called Lost Creek campground, which sits just inside Lassen National Park along its northern border with Lassen National Forest. On the second day we decided to take a late afternoon hike down an old somewhat overgrown logging road just on the other side of the national park/national forest boundary fence.  We knew of this road and its destination because we had hiked it four years earlier.  This road was lined with tree stumps, and had decades of old logging debris, and it had permanent tire grooves in the dirt.  As this road heads north down the slope from our campground it runs about 3000 ft., until it ends at a fire road running east to west.  We hiked west on this road about 100 yards to where the road runs along side a small meadow to the north. We hiked across this meadow to a creek called Lost Creek, hence the name of our camping site.<BR><BR>After soaking our feet in the icy water, my friend said we should probably head back up to camp as it was getting close to 7:00pm and he didn''t want too get stuck down there while it got dark.  We crossed the meadow back to the fire road and started walking east.  We then noticed on the road about 200 yards ahead of us, what at first glance appeared to be a large naked man with a dark complexion, walking away from us.  At second glance I thought maybe he isn''t naked but he''s wearing a fur coat with a pointy hood.  I remember saying to my friend \"take a look at this guy\". A few seconds later the figure stopped in its tracks and moved to the left side of the road, the whole time with its back to us.  I got the impression that he/it had noticed something and went to investigate.  A few seconds later it continued on its way with a very swift and deliberate gate, arms swinging slightly.<BR><BR>I think what sticks in my mind the most was the bawdiness of the shoulders.  In fact, I remember this character had a well defined hourglass figure.  He/it remained on the road for what seemed like a full minute, the entire time it was walking away from us, with his back to us. The more I watched the stranger I thought the situation was.  Eventually the figure disappeared from view, either around a bend in the road or up into forest to the left, I could not determine the direction.  We didn''t say too much about what we had just seen, however we seemed to walk a little more quickly back to camp.  I know I was a little nervous.  I can''t really put a size to this figure, because of the distance at which we viewed it, but if pressed, I would have to say it was over 6''5\" tall and about 270lbs., maybe even 300lbs. <BR><BR>The rest of the evening was uneventful, but the next morning at about 5:45am we both were awaken by what sounded to us, to be a series of powerful yelps and growls coming from the general direction of the area where we were hiking the day before.  I don''t know if any other campers in the area heard this. <BR><BR>My friend and I never really discussed this event among ourselves; or anyone else for several years, until for some reason, I brought it up once.  We still can''t come to an agreement on what we saw or heard.  I''ve told my wife about the incident, but very few others. I don''t know if my friend has told anyone.

There were 4 of us hunting that day; my dad, and myself and 2 good buddies. Well, the deer hunting was not that good that day so one of my buddies said to us, my wife''s uncle is gone from his cabin and won''t be back any time soon, so why don''t we visit his land and all and just hang out and all and have some lunch. <BR><BR>Well, he lives by Lake Hughes''s road and close to where we were. We went over there and unlocked the gate as he had a key. We went in there and we had brought some apples for our lunch and all. We seen he had hogs and started feeding them these apples. After about 1/2 hour of doing this, we heard the horses behind the house or cabin, running around and making all kinds of noise. <BR><BR>We could not see what was going on as; the house was in the way. But, man were they going nuts!!!  So, we all said to each other, let''s get over there and see what''s up. We did and could not see anything but the horses still going nuts and running in circles. We then looked over this fence and threw a gate and seen these huge foot print''s and smelled something like a dog that''s been wet and rotten egg''s mixed. Well, the gate was locked and he went inside the cabin or house and got a key for the gate. <BR><BR>We went over to the prints, and I''m 6-5 at that time, and weighed 275 lbs. I have a shoe size of 15 4-E. These tracks were much bigger than my shoe and they were made, with some of them in the snow.  I stepped next to them and could not press down and going that deep! I could go maybe 3/4 - 1 inch down. These prints were 4 inches deep!! They were also, 2 to3 inches longer than my foot and much wider.<BR><BR>Then I tried to step that far with my step, and no way could I. Then we followed the tracks until they came to this really steep hill. There this thing went up this hill on 2 legs and stepped high enough that, even my good buddy who was a body builder and in great shape, could not climb. I could not even lift my leg that far, and I was 16 years old and pretty limber. No man could lift there leg that high or step that far! No man!!!  Nowhere did we see bear tracks and even if we did, they don''t walk that far on 2 legs. Whatever this was, it walked along this fence and turned and went back into the woods, and then up this very steep hill. It must have looked at the horses and maybe seen us feeding the hogs. I never seen it, but we got scared and left that ranch. <BR><BR>I have told this story to a few people, and they look at me like, it could be, but you can tell, they don''t think this is real.

My best guess is 1978 or 1979.  My father, mother, younger brother and I were camping in a State Park off of Highway 101, in Mendocino County, CA.  Our parents were in their late thirties, I was 16 or 17 and my brother was 10 or 11.  (Of course these ages are approximate and may have been a year or two less or more).  We also had our dog with us, a 60-pound Black Lab - Dalmatian mix.  It was late July to early September and very likely Labor Day or the weekend after Labor Day.  <BR><BR>The park in situated on both sides of the Eel River, and is for the most part second growth or new growth Redwood forest mixed with other trees and brush of the area.  The main section of the park is next to Highway 101. The far side of the park, away from the highway and across the river, is only open from the end of May to the middle of September.  The rest of the year the access bridge is removed and stowed above the high water line. The far side of the park has more foliage and is frequented by bear, deer, raccoon, skunks and other animals.  We were camping on the far side of the park as far up the hill as possible.<BR><BR>I believe this event occurred toward Labor Day or the weekend after Labor Day for the following reasons; we had something of a ritual in making a final &#8220;end of the Summer&#8221; trip to this park, the park was very quiet meaning other campers had made an early start home to avoid holiday traffic or were not there at all being the weekend after Labor Day, and on this particular morning my father stayed in camp to do some paper work.  He was a high school math teacher so he usually did lesson plans or other work only in the late summer.<BR><BR>Mom, my brother, the dog and I decided to take a short hike up a trail on the edge of the campground.  The trail worked its way up over the crest of the hills for about two miles and ended above a barn and farm located in a clearing at the bottom of the other side of the hills.  The trail is mainly up hill, makes several cut backs, and passes across two or three unpaved fire roads.  It was a clear sunny day and there was no one else out on the trail.  <BR><BR>Our dog liked to take the point position to see the animals ahead.  She was an avid hunter of rabbits and liked to chase deer.  I had often seen her race after deer, taking dangerous inclines and thick brush at full speed.  On this day I do not recall her scaring up anything to chase.  The three of us talked as we went up the trail.  During the last half mile to quarter mile of the trail my mother gave us a serious order to stop. We paused while she looked and listened to an area behind us to our left.  She asked if we heard any thing, but I do not recall if my brother or I did.  <BR><BR>We walked on, more slowly now, listening to the forest.  After about 50 yards we felt like we could hear something moving in the woods, behind us to our left, and once again stopped.  The noise stopped when we stopped.  This time we indicated that we did hear it.  The dog was in the middle of the trail listening as well but did not go into the brush to investigate.  We continued on now for another 50-100 yards and we were almost to the crest and the vista area.  Again we thought we heard the noise paralleling us to our left but were not 100% sure.  We all stopped again.  Before we could again acknowledge the sound, there was a loud wooden knocking noise off to our right.  It was 3-4 quick &#8220;knock - knock - knock &#8211; knock&#8221;.  Initially I thought it was two tree trunks rubbing together in the wind.  I looked up to see if I could see anything, but there was no breeze.  Before I could look back down, there was a loud forceful huffing of air coming from the bottom of the tree.  It was something like a growl but not quite.  It was low and guttural, and was a rapid exhalation of air from a very large animal.  <BR><BR>Whatever it was, that was enough for us.  It was my mother who spun around and said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s go.&#8221;  No one disagreed and we turned and sprinted all the way back to camp.  I think we covered the two miles without a stop.  Instead of taking the lead, the dog took up the rear position, which in my mom&#8217;s opinion was meant to protect us from whatever was behind us.  This was the first and only time we heard anything like that and was the only time we have ever even contemplated running in fear during a hike.  I do not recall any smell in the area. <BR><BR>The incident has never felt right to me and I have thought back to it on several occasions.  My mother has always thought that a bear was stalking us.  (She has always had a very strong apprehension of bears, and always warned us not to get between a cub and its mother, or try to feed a bear or approach any bear.  Nonetheless, we have chased them away on more than one occasion.).  I have heard of stalking behavior in bears before, but only in grizzlies, browns and polar bears &#8211; not in the California black bears.  Additionally, the behavior of the animal did not seem like a bear either, and did not elicit the response from our dog that I would have expected for a bear.  <BR><BR>I discovered this site about 12 months ago and the similarities of other&#8217;s reports with my incident made me think that this was a bigfoot.  Assuming the accuracy of other&#8217;s stories, it seems to be a more plausible explanation than being followed by a bear as well, as a better fit with the facts.  I spoke to my mother recently about it and she still felt it was a bear, besides she said, &#8220;Bigfoot are only up in the Pacific Northwest.&#8221;  I separately spoke to my father about this site and he thought I was pulling his leg.  After I told him that I believed the stories were sincere, and told him some of the common details of the events, he immediately brought up that time &#8220;you guys came running down from the trail.&#8221;<BR><BR>I did not send this sooner because it is a class B and twenty plus years old already.  I have heard a couple of stories regarding other incidents, but none that I have first or second hand knowledge of.   <BR><BR>What may be of interest is that I have seen a nest like the one in Report 2928.  I cannot recall exactly where I saw it but it was within the last 5 years.  It was some where in the Sierras, and I think it was in the Mammoth Lakes area.  I recall being off trail, cutting between lakes, or trying to relocate a trail when I saw it.  In any case it was well off the trail and quite a way from the town or trailhead.  Thinking it was a human&#8217;s hand made shelter, I was surprised at the amount of effort that must have went into building the little A frame.  It was tucked in between some tree trunks and the roof was a tight thatch of broken limbs.  It just struck me that a tent would have been easier to move and set up, and would have afforded better protection overall.  I glanced around but did not see any garbage or clothes or other signs of a camp.  There was no smell that I recall.  I was also surprised at how far away the nest was from the town &#8211; whoever this belonged to was trying to stay well away from the trail and others.  I guessed that it must belong to someone that really wanted to be left alone, so I went on my way.  <BR><BR><BR>", :environment "Redwood forest, new and second growth.

The weekends were made for pitching camp and swiming in the Rattlesnake Creek that runs along the foot of the property.  This time I wanted to spend the night along the side of the river by the deep pool we always swam in. The river has giant boulders to lay on and bask in the sun.  Both sides of the river are steep one side one side is so steep and gravel like you cant even climb it. <BR><BR>Well after much pleading with the people I had brought, they said ok we will camp on the river.  They were drinking a bit much and I was not going to touch it because I was worried they may decide to take a swim and sink.  We had fun with a small campfire we sat and laughed until it was late.  We rolled out our sleeping bags on the bank, the river at our feet and the steep cliff to our heads.  The spot we were in had a bit of a ledge high over our heads.I dont know what time it was when I woke up but I am a light sleeper and I heard the gravel over our heads being walked on. I lay still and listened.  It is moving across the top of the ledge toward my right. There is a deer trial that comes down to creek level about 10 feet away from where I am sleeping and I hear this person coming down it.  I was scared and tried to wake the people closest to me without making to much noise.  Then I kicked the person to my left and he snores louder.  <BR><BR>To my right, this person (I say person because it was two footed by the sound of it) was no more than 10 feet from me.  It stood behind a willow bush/baby tree it was really just 5 or six canes coming out of the stream bed.  It was dark but I could feel its size when it walked and shook the canes.  I kept thinking I am going to kill these @#% guys, why are they sleeping still? <BR><BR>Then the thing started yelling at me.  I know the sound of the animals in the California woods.  I have never heard this in my life.  It was yelling at us \"What the hell are you doing hear, this is my place.\"  It wasn''t like a mountain lion grawling and saying \"I''m tough and I can kick your [butt].\"  It was broken up into batches of sounds with inflections that I recognized. It was like a person speaking another language but you know they are telling you directly to get the hell out of my house.<BR><BR>I could see glimpses of it when its body moved into the light of the river.  Its right side was as tall as the canes I knew to be 8 foot-ish.  It ranted and raved and stomped and shook the bush.  I smelled skunk and thought \"Great this is all I need, they will bury me without a funeral because I am going to stink.\" I finally got my voice and said \"Ok Ok its alright ok ok .\" I did not see or hear it leave.  But I realized at some point it had left.  My encounter lasted only a few minutes but it felt much longer.  I stayed awake the rest of the night and I was so mad in the morning at my fellow campers.

It will help explain the delay in ever having reposted this incident. The sighting occurred about three months prior to my entering the United States Army. I served for three years as a Paratrooper with a Top Secret Clearance. After my time in the service, I became a Los Angeles Police officer. I did that for thirteen years and am now a Federal Agent, working for an O.I.G. out of Washington DC. With that background, you can probably understand my reluctance to discuss this sighting with too many people. It really boils down to a potential career killer. <BR><BR>That being said the incident DID occur and I remember it vividly. Many many years after the event, I reconnected with my friend (the witness) and asked him to tell ME the story as he recalled it. I wanted to check my memory and see if his matched mine. It did. To a T! Only a few months ago, I spoke with my brother in law, a witness after the fact. I asked him if he remembered the event. He did. It should be known that he is not the kind of person that would \"buy into\" such a story, had he not been semi involved. <BR><BR>Anyway, this is what happened: My friend Craig and I were both 17 years old and waiting to leave for Army Basic Training. He was due to leave in June and I would go in August of 1980. We were staying with my Sister and Brother in Law at the time. They lived in a cabin in Green Valley California. Craig and I enjoyed our last months as civilians in that area, and used it to train for the difficult training ahead of us. We ran every day along the mountain roads and hiked the hills, trying to get into prime shape. <BR><BR>In May, we decided to test ourselves and camp out for a full seven days. We knew the perfect place for this would be what we called \"The old campground\" because of its isolated surroundings and terrain that would be perfect for climbing and hiking. So, we packed up a weeks worth of supplies and, though my sister Cindy and her husband Tom offered to drive us, we decided to act like soldiers and walk to the location. We did this with full packs. <BR><BR>My sister and Tom advised us that they would check on us at least every other day and that they would bring us food and lemonade and such. Tom also, offered to provide us with two weapons to be used for protection against any strangers that may try to harm us. After all this was before cell phones and we would be on our own big-time. There was also a heavy rattlesnake threat in that area, so we happily took him up on the offer. Tom met us at an area near the mine shafts later that day and gave us an M-1 rifle and a 12 gauge shotgun, with ammo for both.<BR><BR>The dirt trail that leads off of the main highway goes very far back into the mountains. In fact, were you to traverse it to its end, you would end up on top of what is known as Grass Mountain. Craig and I decided to get about three miles in and away from the highway, which was about a mile past what once was an old 1920s campground, and live deep in the bush like soldiers would. We found a great spot, next to a clear running creek and set up our tent in the clearing that was there. This clearing was completely surrounded by thick woods. Then night fell.<BR><BR>As we lay in our tent talking by the light of flashlights, we both heard the very loud snap of deadfall in the woods behind the tent. We sat up, frozen and listening. We heard what sounded like a very large and heavy person, slowly walking around our site, making no effort to conceal his presence, judging from the loud sound of breaking sticks and brush. We were both scared believing that someone was out there. We exited the tent, Craig with a shotgun and me with the M-1. I started yelling very loud. \"Hey! We know you are there. We have guns and will shoot!\" <BR><BR>Again, we heard the sound of someone walking slowly but methodically around from our left to right. We shinned our lights in the direction but could not see anything but the trees and brush. We talked amongst ourselves, wondering if it could be a bear or something, but we decided that it was a person and not an animal. After much yelling and warning that we would shoot, I decided to fire a few rounds in the direction of the noise (how crazy that sounds now) and I did just that. I fired about three rounds into the trees and the sound was unbelievable. <BR><BR>The weapon blasted and the sound echoed into the night, roaring into the canyons and fading off into the night air. We stood in silence. To our utter disbelief and eventual horror whatever it was, began to move again, still left to right, in a circle around us. What we both thought and discussed later, was that NO animal would have stuck around after the horrific noise of the M-1. Most normal people would not have stuck around either! Whoever or whatever was out there not only stuck around, but appeared, from the casual sound of the slow walking, to be less than concerned about our weapons. We made a decision to vacate the area post haste! Grabbing our coats, we climbed the embankment up to the dirt road, and carrying our weapons, we ran the entire way, about three miles more or less, back to the main highway, San Francisquito Canyon Rd. We spent a very long night, curled up in a concrete drainage ditch, waiting for the sun to rise. Every hour or so, a lone truck would come by and the sound of that brought us comfort. Again, it was a long night!<BR><BR>The next day, we hiked back to the site, expecting to find our tent and all of our supplies missing. To our surprise, everything was as we had left it. Nothing was out of place. We gathered our things, and hiked back to the open area of the old campground. We decided not to sleep in the tent because it limited our vision, and instead, laid our sleeping bags out in an open area, above the creek. After a day of climbing cliffs and cooking and such, night fell again.<BR><BR>That night, just as the sun set and darkness was beginning to fall, Craig and I were walking in the direction of the main road. We were looking for rattle snakes, because we had shot one earlier on the dirt road in the same area. As we walked side by side with me on the left, both holding weapons, we saw it. Standing just on the dirt road, facing us was a Bigfoot. There can be NO DOUBT at all about what it was. We could see it very clearly. He was about eight or nine feet tall and stood with his left shoulder even with the edge of the trail. He was covered with dark hair and had long arms. We did NOT smell anything unusual, as I have since read about other sightings. <BR><BR>The strange thing about him was the absolute indifference in his expression. He did not look threatening. He did not look scared. He just stood there looking at us.almost bored. I instinctively brought my right hand up against Craig''s chest and we both stopped dead in our tracks. We never took our eyes off of the Bigfoot as we spoke. I said, \"Do you see that? Are we seeing this?\" Craig said, What do we do? What should we do?\" We both started to walk backwards as we spoke, very slowly and involuntarily. The Bigfoot just looked at us for a few moments. <BR><BR>Then, and I will NEVER forget the detail of this he just slowly and very casually turned to his left, and began to walk into the forest. When he did that, Craig and I stopped and started talking over each other. \"Do we shoot it? Should we shoot it? What do we do? Do you want to follow it?\" As we talked, we heard a sound that we both immediately recognized from the prior night, the sound of the Bigfoot slowly walking deeper into the woods, breaking deadfall, twigs and branches as he went. We never did fire a shot or follow him. We stayed up late and slept in shifts at the campground and did not hear from the Bigfoot again.<BR><BR>The next day, Tom came up with food and supplies. We ran to him and told him the details of what had happened. It was very clear by his expression that he did not believe us. We took him to the exact spot where we saw the Bigfoot and we discovered a trail of giant footprints leading from the trail into the woods. Tom smiled and told us that we did a good job making them. We were so frustrated and begged Tom to follow the tracks with us. We all followed them and they went into and across the creek. On the other side, we found a large red ant hill with a footprint right on top of it. I asked Tom, how could we have done that? He just shook his head and smiled. We followed the tracks to a point where two large hills formed a valley that sloped upwards into the mountain area. The ground turned rocky and the prints stopped. <BR><BR>That is what happened. I have lived with this memory for many years. I am now Forty Five years old and am less concerned about what people think of me in terms of this incident. It is a fact and because of it, I know for sure that Bigfoot lives or at least once lived in the area of Green Valley California. <BR>", :environment "Pine forest in the high desert area of Southern California.

We made it up to the saddle where the trail goes downhill into the wilderness, and where we were supposed to leave the trail and go south up the mountain, and decided we didn''t feel like going any further. I''m assuming we rested for awhile, and I remember just talking and hanging out. As we were getting up and ready to go, we heard a strange noise coming from the bushes nearby. We stopped talking and listened, and it was a very low sort of growl/snuffling sound. My first thought was that it was probably a bear, but that ultimately I had no idea what it was, and it sounded like it was growling at us. The bushes along the trail there were very high, such that we couldn''t see through them. It scared the hell out of us and so we quickly hoofed it back down the trail. I''m not sure if we ever spoke about it again, except to maybe say I wonder what it was, that was scary, etc.<BR><BR>But afterwards I actually looked through field guides trying to figure out what was making the noise. I knew that bears, mountain lions & bobcats are relatively prevalent in that part of the San Gabriel Mountains, so assumed it was probably one of those. But, after browsing around your site, and seeing several sightings near the SG Wilderness listed, I''m beginning to wonder. In retrospect (although it could be my overactive imagination), it sounded a bit apelike.

I was a boy when my brother-inlaw of that day and one or two of his hunting friends had an excellant and fairly long term sighting, both via their eyes and through high powered rifle scopes. <BR><BR>However I can relate some of this information to you and even put you in touch with two of the possible three people, can''t guarantee they will talk with you about the sighting, but one never knows. In fact I spoke with my ex-brother in-law about this earlier this evening because I happened upon your website and explored it.<BR> <BR>What is very significant is that Sam and Don had every opportunity to shoot this animal and/or person and thought about it, but could not because it looked to human! <BR><BR>Only THREE DAYS later Big Foot reports hit the news. My father and Sam AKA Sandy, in front of me took a forest map out and Sam became quiet as the new sightings were only 15 miles from his encounter, and in the direction the creature was traveling. The newer sightings as I recall put the creature near Pear Blossum, CA on the other side of the mountains. I remember a news report of 1000 people lined up across the desert looking for anything and they did find some hair on a barbwire fence. To this day I know of no one having reported this first encounter three days prior. <BR><BR>Another significant item is that in those days bear season and deer season overlaped or was one in the same. At first they thought this might be a deforemed bear (they had bear tags) as they witnessed this being walking on two legs just like any human and appeared to be 7 to 8 feet tall. <BR><BR>They were a few hundred yards away on the other side of the caynon, (don''t remember the name of the caynon) but their rifle scopes allowed them to see this clearly enough that viewing the face and shape they could not decide if this was an animal or a human. I remember Sandy/Sam saying it looked like a monkey man. The animal/person seemingly did not know they were there. They had bear tags and thought about shooting the creature but as I said could not make themselves do it. I recall Sam telling my father that it had to be a bear because it dropped to all fours when it climbed the steeper terrain. My father asked Sam: How did you guys climb it? The reply was the same as the deformed bear. <BR><BR>About then my brother in-law was no longer jovial regarding the sighting and preffered not to discuss the incident. Until now I have more or less left the man alone about it. Today he is a Plant Manager for a large trailer company. <BR><BR>Don still lives in Baldwin Park, CA but maybe moving to San Diego, CA. I seldom cross paths with Don nor have I never pursued the matter with him. If you folks are interested I can put you in touch with both of them but you may have to settle for what I have related. Without the permission of at lest one of the actual witnesses it might not be right to post this information.  <BR><BR>As for myself today I am 40 years old and drive for MTA and I am use to making out reports. I understand the need for accuracy without exaggeration. I hope this relayed information was not to long winded and useful. <BR><BR>Tim P. <BR> <BR>Tim P. only heard this story 2nd hand as a youth.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>", :environment "Steep canyon with trees and manzanita brush, fading out to desert.", :fixed_year "1972", :run_time "2022-05-20 16:14:48.000000"} {:nearestroad "Beasore Rd.", :date nil, :locationdetails "The sighting took place at the end of a road leading to a trail head that leads into the back of yosemite park.

We parked in an area just below the ridge where when the sun lightened up enough we could easily hike up to the top in about 20 minutes. As it got light enough to see the top, we noticed someone already on the ridge wearing what seemed to be black of all things. He had no light, and no gun, and we wondered where he came from because we had been camped there for 11 days, and no one had come by that whole time. We watched him dig around in some brush for at least 30 minutes, pausing occasionaly for long periods to just stare in different directions. We joked that it was probably a hunter from L.A. because anyone would be crazy to wear just black during deer, and bear season. Then he began to walk down the hill right for us, now we never left the truck yet, and he would walk a little ways and the stop and look around just as if he was hunting, but with no rifle. He walked just like a human, so at this time there was no reason to think it was anything but a man. After a little while it was getting light enough to see even better, and he was still walking straight for us. When he was about 50 yards away we both at the same time realized we were not watching a man, but this was a Bigfoot! He walks like a man, but he was not a man. He had jet black, shiny fur, with a reddish color around where his eyes were. At this moment I was ready to run clear home in one leap! I had to see this thing up close, and he had not noticed us yet, so I tried to open the door of the truck real easy so he wouldn''t notice, but that old ford truck was anything but quiet, and he heard the latch release and took one good look before breaking into a run. I tried to bring the scope up to view him closer, but this guy could really move, and I could not get my eye into the scope before he got behind a tree and nev er came out. It took all the nerve in my body to walk over to the tree, but he was not there he flat disappeared.

We are San Francisco City people, artist; not hunters. We are not used to the outdoors or accustom to the forest and nature and the shock of fresh clean air.<BR><BR>The first encounter was on Tuesday evening, 8/16/05 at 5:17pm on highway 128 in the Redwood forest. We were on a vacation, driving west on 128 and heading towards Fort Bragg, CA. Once we entered the state park, we stopped and parked to smell the fresh air. I marked the time, because I was shooting with my digital camera. We walked into the forest, on a trail, and were having a great time, enjoying our time alone. There was little traffic or noise from the road. The forest was quiet and powerful. We have lived in the center of San Francisco for 15 years, and were stunned and amazed to experience the silence and peace of the Redwoods. As we got deeper into the woods, about 20 minutes, I started to get uneasy; feeling like someone was watching us. The digital photos my wife took of me show my concern, the longer we stayed. Then we heard it.  It was a growl-grunting. Just above the hearing of my ears. I would described it as infra-sound- a deep sound that was low in pitch, deep, almost inaudible. My body felt it more than my ears. It threw me in a panic. The fear in me rose fast. I looked at my wife and she was feeling the panic. We both looked around. We could not tell the direction. We could not see anything in the thick woods around us. It could have been a bear or a wolf. But my instincts said no. I did not know what it was. But, the \"vibe\" message was becoming clear- GO AWAY NOW! <BR><BR>Predators do not warn-they ambush-right? My wife looked at me and said Did you hear that? I said Yes. She said, Lets get back to the car. I said Good idea!  It was a weird feeling. We were stunned and mystified as we ran back to the car. We drove away nervous and excited about what happened. On our way to Fort Bragg, CA, we were talking about the experience. Was it a bigfoot? Did we have a Bigfoot encounter? We felt something special had just happened. We had to learn more about bigfoots.  <BR><BR>Over the year, I became obsessed with bigfoots. I read as mush as I could about the Sasquatch, Yeren, Almasty, and Yeti as my time permit. My wife became obsessed also. Together we decided to go back to those redwoods and try to make contact with the forest giants. <BR><BR>We made it back to highway 128 on Monday 9/4/06. Something told me to pull over at a different spot. As soon as I got out, I had the DV video camera running. On the camera my wife tells me to make my Whoop-Whoop Bigfoot call, into the redwood forest. As soon as I did, the camera records wood knocking and tree breaking. Soon the smell of a dead animal/skunk filled the air. <BR><BR>The sounds and smells go on for about three minutes,  then stops. I could tell he moved away after my calls to him, inviting him to be photographed. We left the redwood forest, excited about our contact. <BR><BR>My wife wants to see a bigfoot. I do not want to see him.  I hear that many people die or have very bad luck after seeing a Bigfoot. Remember Dr. Morbius from the movie Forbidden Planet?

We live on 2 acres in Redwood Valley, CA.  It was dark and about 6:00 with a mod. overcast sky, the moon peeking through the clouds. We have a small dog that will usually bark in response to any other dog barking in our area.  Houses are well-spaced on our rolling hillside that''s covered with a mix of oak and pines. From Hwy. 101 looking west, you see very few houses on our hillside. Anyway, as I was walking I could hear this very unusual \"animal\" sound unlike any I''ve heard before. It was NOT a dog howling and I''m not even sure how to describe it. We have coyotes and mountain lions and the sound would not fit the description of their cries or calls either. It had a yelling/howl quality that lasted about 5 seconds , would break off and then resume about 15 seconds later. I went in the house to get my husband so that he could hear the sound. My dog was not barking which is really unusual because he''s inclinded to bark at dogs or other unfamiliar sounds.  None of the dogs on our hillside were barking either which seemed odd to me. I was kind of scared .  My husband came out and listened. His initial response was, \"Anyway, it''s on the other side of that hill.\" I said, \"It''s not a dog, and our dog is not barking at it.\"  He agreed it was strange but wasn''t concerned. Soon thereafter, a dog could be heard barking and our dog started in with his typical barking response. The unusual sound stopped and I didn''t hear it again. This is not the first time we''ve heard  unusual sounds that we can''t identify. We woke up one night hearing whooping sounds outside the house that I can''t connect with any animal I''m familiar with. My daughter has also heard whooping sounds on the same hillside where we heard the unusual sounds last night. My teenage son heard whooping sounds last summer in the manzanita to the north of our house. We had an odd experience last summer. My college aged son and his friends were imitating \"Big Foot\" sounds that they''d heard on the internet . It was about 11:00 at night when they were fooling around , loudly imitating the sounds.  About 1:00 AM, that same night, we were watching a video and we heard a scratching at the window. We all thought my son was outside trying to scare everyone. All of a sudden , water was splashing all over the side of the house. A water sprinkler pipe outside the window had been snapped off, and water was geysering out of the pipe. My son walked out of the bathroom and it turned out he''d been in the house all along. No one had been outside and we still wonder how the pipe was snapped off. Whatever had been scratching at the window had apparently broken the pipe.  We all wondered if it was a response to the Big Foot calls that the guys had been making.

I remember thinking that it was either a person walking very leisurely or something bigger walking at a normal gait. I didn''t quite know what to do so, on an impulse, I made a growling sound. Then the footsteps stopped, but resumed a few seconds later. I repeated the growl and the same thing happened.

I don''t remember if it was late (2 am) and I woke up, or if it was earlier in the night (say 11 pm) and I was just going to sleep.

I was surprised at first and a little afraid because I was squatting illegally on state property.<BR><BR>With my familiarity of the noises of the night in the woods, I listened carefully to try to determine or identify what was making the noise. My first assessment was that it was bi-ped ... not a bear or a deer.

I don''t know if profanity is allowed or acceptable, but i was more effing afraid than I could ever remember, praying that what I was listening to wouldn''t start moving towards my tent.<BR><BR>The noise sounded like a two-legged monster crashing through the woods hastily as if trying to make quick time CRASH CRASH CRASH CRASH !!! It was then I realized that I heard a dog (or two, I don''t remember) barking in pursuit. Gratefully, the noise was not coming towards me and I suspected that whatever was moving so quickly and violently through the woods was trying to elude the dog(s). <BR><BR>I think this whole event lasted about 30 seconds and then the crashing stopped.

Soon after, we put a trailer on the flats near the boat dock, and moved to the coast permanently.  The encounter happened one evening just before dark, as the sun was just going down over the hill. My parents, younger sister, and younger brother were on the boat and getting ready for bed. It was before 8 p.m.  My older sister and myself had to sleep in the car as there wasn''t enough bunks on the boat for us to sleep. We had blankets and pillows on the seat to sleep on.  The car was a 1957 two-door Pontiac Chieftain. I had the back seat and she the front. I remember it being too early and light out to want to go to sleep. We sat there and talked as teenagers will do. Across the river was a steep rolling hillside that had sheep grazing on it that belonged to a man named Paul Anderson. We had the windows down as it was summer and very nice out. We were interrupted in our talking by the sounds of sheep crying out in unison and baaing in a way that didn''t sound normal for sheep. We both jumped up and looked out the right side windows trying to see what was after the sheep. We could see the sheep running frantically towards the west side of the hillside pasture.  The sheep were scattering in different directions, separating into smaller bunches. To the left  and upper part of the field, we both spotted two very large and hairy animals chasing the sheep.  We thought that they were bears running on their hind legs like trained animals would do. It was very alarming for us to watch as these bears were terrorizing these poor sheep. Our position from the attack was about 150 yards or more. We watched as these big animals chased the sheep for what seemed like hours.  In reality, the whole chase scene was about 20 or 30 minutes. As it got dark, we were sure that the bears would swim the river and come for us next. We locked the doors and hid under the blankets for the rest of night.  It seemed like an eternity til morning came and we could finally get out of the car and go to the boat to see our parents. We told them what had happened, and I know that they thought that we had stayed up all night dreaming up that story. That morning, we were up at the post office near where the attack had occurred, and people were talking about the sheep being killed by a wild pack of dogs that were roaming around. The Sheriff, Sam Costa said that it was unusual for dogs kill and eat only the belly and insides of the sheep.

Forest).  To get to the property, which was located many miles from civilazation, you had to travel on a very rough road (one cut with a dozer) so our motor home could not make it to our lot. Near by was a small pond and a campsite that was for the use of property owners. The pond was about 75 to 100 feet across, the banks were covered in cat tails and the pond was full of trout (we tried all day to catch some fish, without luck). My family(wife, son and 2 daughters) were aware of how quiet it was in the evening, we could not even get a station on the radio. We built a camp fire and were sitting around it watching the field mice run down to the edge of the pond to get a drink. As I remember it was a bright night, the moon was visible overhead. <BR><BR>Along about 10 or 11 pm, the wife and kids went into the camper and went to bed. I remained outside by the camp fire trying to get a station on the walkman radio. About 1am, I was putting out the fire when I saw movement on the other side of the pond, I noticed the movement because of the noise this thing was making. At first I thought it was a deer (I was told they were common in the area) so with that thought I headed toward the sound armed with my trusty flashlite. As I approached, the moonlite was very bright, I could see lots of movement in the cat tails but could not see the animal. At this point it hit me that maybe it was a mountain lion, because I could hear a low rumbling sound like a cat purring but much louder. I decided to return to the motor home, as I turned to retrace my steps (I was probably 50 feet from the noise) this huge hulk stood up in front of me and made a loud screeching noise. It raised up to a full standing position, I would say 7 or 8 ft tall, dark brownish hair.  We looked at each other for a moment and then I turned and ran full speed away from him.  When I looked back to see if he was following me, he was walking in the opposite direction toward the deep forest. I stood and watched him until he disappeared in the deep woods. He did not walk like an animal but more like a man. When I composed myself, I went back to the area I saw him at to look for tracks, but all I found was crushed cat tails, an area of about 10 ft in dia was all smashed down, and it smelled like a strong urine smell in the area. I told the family what I saw and to this day they think I saw a deer or some other animal. I tell this story now to my grand children when we go camping.

Ive been meaning to submit this experience to BFRO for a while now but I wanted to find the right timeframe noted in my journal.  I had lost this journal but I recently moved and found it in a box while unpacking.  <BR><BR>I still remember it clearly, although I have never submitted it to any site such as this before. I am an avid backpacker and have backpacked extensively in the western states, in the wildest and remotest regions, and have encountered many large wild animals including grizzly bears. Never before nor since have I had such an odd experience as this one. <BR><BR>I left one Friday evening (August 1, 1986) by myself after work with my dogs (at the time my family had a beagle and a poodle, I''ll take anything hiking with me!), and I was trying to find a lake up in Tahoe National Forest called White Rock Lake. I had never been there before so I wasn''t familiar with the unmarked roads. According to the topo map I could get there via a 4-wheel drive road. <BR><BR>Way back behind Truckee, northeast of Fordyce Lake, I found myself driving slowly, at night, on rough rocky dirt roads, trying to figure out where I was. Roads would seem to peter out, or bisect with other 4-wheel drive roads, and I had no clue where I was going. I was way out in the middle of nowhere... no lakes or significant creeks or any destination type areas within miles. <BR><BR>I decided to wait until daylight before I confused myself anymore in the darkness. I''m sure I didn''t even need to pull off the little \"road\" I was on since I hadn''t seen anyone or anything, but just in case, I did. I pulled off the rocky road just a few yards, my Datsun 4-wheel drive pickup hidden by trees. I grabbed my sleeping bag, tossed it outside in front of my truck, and me and my dogs slept under a very starry night. <BR><BR>Sometime early in the morning, around 3 or 4 a.m. (it was still pitch black), I awoke and heard something walking up the road in my direction. I could tell it was heavy, and it was walking steadily my way. At first I thought it must''ve been a backpacker, as it was obviously bipedal by the rhythm of the walk. The steps were distinct. Then I thought to myself, what would a backpacker be doing way out here on this road, in the middle of the night, with no light, with nothing but miles of thick forest in all directions? I knew it wasn''t a bear (I''ve encountered dozens of bears in my years in the wild). I had no idea what this was, but a backpacker was still my best guess. <BR><BR>As it got closer and closer, I wondered if I should say something, but I didn''t want to scare anyone unnecessarily. I''m sure it would just walk right by. But, for some reason, I was getting increasingly nervous, and there aren''t too many things in the wilderness that make me nervous. The odd thing was my dogs weren''t making a sound, or a move for that matter, which added to the suspense. My dogs would have normally at least given a warning bark or two. This heavy, bipedal thing was coming closer and closer and was about to come to the point where I had pulled my truck off the road. I laid there very quietly. I didn''t know what to expect, and hoped whatever or whoever it was would just continue on by, not even noticing me. It was so dark I couldn''t see a thing. <BR><BR>The closer it got, the bigger I realized it must be, because through the rhythm of the walk I could tell it was quite large. I stayed silent in my nervousness. A sasquatch was the last thing on my mind as I hadn''t really given much thought in the past to such a thing, especially in the Sierras. That was about to change. It came up to where I had parked my truck off the road, and... silence. It stopped. Although I couldn''t see it in the darkness, it was only a few yards away from where I was laying in my sleeping bag. <BR><BR>I don''t know if I made a sound, or one of my dogs made a sound, but something happened that made it react. This thing let out the most heinous, forest-piercing scream you could imagine. I can''t even attempt to put in words what this thing sounded like. It had a set of lungs on it like nothing I could describe or accurately imitate. Then, still screaming, it turned around and ran back down the road in the darkness at a fast rate of speed. It screamed the whole time, echoing through the forest. It never let up. I could hear the screams fading in the distance.<BR><BR>I laid there in total shock. I couldn''t believe what just happened. Eventually I jumped up and tossed everything in my truck. My dogs acted just as freaked as me. I knew whatever it was a long distance away by this point, so before leaving the area I drove down the road with my brights on, trying to see if I could see any footprints or signs of anything odd. My adrenaline was flowing big time. Although I didn''t actually get out of the truck, I opened the door and looked down to see if I could see footprints or any clue of what this thing was. The road was too rocky for footprints. I then let my dogs out, hoping they would pick up a scent (although I didn''t know what I''d do if they did), but oddly they jumped right back in the truck. This was out of character for them. I tossed them back out again, and they jumped right back in. I decided if they''re as freaked out as I am, I better get the heck out of there and I drove many miles back towards the main road. <BR><BR>I hadn''t thought much of a sasquatch before this experience, but now I''m certainly a believer. People try and explain it away to me, but I know what I heard. I didn''t see it, nor did I smell anything, but it was so close I could feel it. And it was so close when it screamed that I''m surprised I didn''t get spit on. Nothing in those forests could scream like that, nor run that fast, especially nothing that walked upright. I don''t dwell on the bigfoot subject, nor have I made it a mission to seek them out, but I know theyre out there. My experience is still very vivid. It doesn''t matter to me whether someone believes it or not. I''m not submitting this report to convince anyone otherwise. I''m just sharing an experience I had in the Sierras one night, near Truckee. <BR>", :environment "Thick forest, rough rocky road that was tough to follow at night.", :fixed_year "1986", :run_time "2022-05-20 16:15:09.000000"} {:nearestroad "HWY 158", :date "30", :locationdetails "The location of the howl was near the Double Eagle Resort and Spa located South of Lee Vining and Mono Lake off HWY 158, which is a two-lane road, which makes a C connecting back to HWY 395.", :submitted_date "2010-07-08", :sketch 0, :bfroid 27966, :otherwitnesses "The first vocalization my brother, father and I were outside on the deck of our cabin around midnight.The second vocalization my brother and father were watching TV with all of the windows open and my mother was in bed with the windows open in her room as well.", :run_id 34, :nearesttown "June Lake", :timeandconditions "Between 11:30pm-1am.", :month "0001-06-01", :county "Mono County", :state "California", :fixed_month "0001-06-01", :submitted "2010-07-08 00:00:00.000000", :title "Possible howl heard by three family members while on vacation at June Lake", :otherstories "No", :year "2010", :season "Summer", :class "Class B", :alsonoticed "I live in the Santa Clara Valley near the Santa Cruz Mountains and the Saratoga Foothills.

The trip was quite uneventful (or so we assumed).<BR><BR>The tape went into our family home video collection and for 17 years, from 1991 to 2008, it has been watched countless times by family and friends. So much so that my kids have the dialog on much of the tape collection memorized. On April 19, 2008 my daughter (6 years old in the video and now 22) was watching the tape in the downstairs family room when she suddenly screamed out and began yelling for me to come downstairs. I thought something bad had happened and after racing down the staircase, found my daughter and my ex sitting in front of the television telling me to watch a segment from the tape. What I saw when we played it back made the hair stand up on the back of my neck. And it was something none of us had ever noticed in almost 17 years of watching this tape,<BR><BR>In the final few seconds of the Mono Lake segment just before I turned the camera off I caught something very large and black moving between two rock formations a short distance from where we had been hiking. It was completely black with no differentiation in color or texture and walked upright like a human but with a gate more like a primate. At first I thought it was a bear, but after going over the video many times and finally digitizing and sharpening it I am now unsure what to think. From examination of the footage of my family whose distance from the camera was comparable to that of the creature it is easy to see the distinct details and variation in clothing, hair, face and hands. In contrast, the creature caught on tape exhibits none of those distinctions.The shape of the body does not resemble a human. The head is too large and the arms are too long. And although it does resemble a bear at one particular angle in the clip, the stance and gate don''t add up. It is an intriguing mystery.<BR><BR>That we were able to go for 17 years without noticing this event on the tape seems unbelievable, but in retrospect it actually makes some sense. The segment lasts for only a couple of seconds and the focus is on the lake and mountains which is what I must have been filming at the time. I didn''t see it when I shot the tape and it has since gone unnoticed because one must really be looking for it to see it.<BR><BR>I am not a person who is prone to believing in conspiracy theories, alien abductions and bizarre events such as a purported Bigfoot sighting. I''ve seen various footage and photographs of Bigfoot/Sasquatch sightings over the years and have always been extremely skeptical of their authenticity. As an engineer who now teaches high school physics, I am highly educated and very level headed. If I see something I don''t understand my natural reaction is to analyze it rationally using the scientific method. I do not jump to conclusions based on faulty hypotheses. So in this case, I will suspend judgment pursuant to further investigation. But having shown this video to family and friends whose opinions I trust, the overall reaction seems to be a unanimous \"Bigfoot!!\" Wishful thinking? Maybe. Maybe not. Either way it is very intriguing and definitely warrants further investigation.<BR><BR>Your opinion and assistance in this matter would be appreciated.<BR>", :environment "Away from the lake, the area is arid, a dry desert like area with sparse grass, very rocky with small bushes, and no trees.

We always went to the same place and always saw dozens and dozens of rabbits. <BR><BR>We would get up very early in the morning, about 1AM, so that we could get out to our spot about an hour before dawn. So it was a few hours outside of Bishop, CA. We would make sure to get there early so that we could sit in the car and wait for dawn to come. <BR><BR>Just as the sun would start to rise and there was enough light to see we would normally see tons of rabbits running about, but that day was different. There was not a single rabbit in sight. That had never happened before. We stayed in the truck and waited until the sun was fully up before we decided to get out and take a stroll around to see if there was anything to see. Just before we left the truck my dad asked me if I wanted to bring the camera and I told him \"Na, we arent going to see anything out here.\" Ha-ha! Boy was I mistaken. <BR><BR>We took off from the truck and went into the wilderness. There was nothing to see at all. No animals anywhere. We were walking along and suddenly we came upon the giant footprints in the sand. There were two sets of prints, one right next to the other. They were barefoot and looked just like human feet. Right away we knew what they were. Its a natural thing that goes through your mind. When you see them you say yourself, \"Those are bigfoot tracks.\" <BR><BR>The first sets of tracks were HUGE, and thee times as big as my fathers feet, and he is about 6'' 3\" with a good sized foot. (He is very thin though). The second set of footprints was the same size as mine. Right next to its parents tracks. The tracks dug deep into the ground and my father and I talked about that. We tried to stomp on the ground to see if we make an indention as deep as theirs but we couldnt, even with our shoes on. <BR><BR>We followed the tracks and we came to a barbwire fence. On the other side was a paved road. On the other side of the road was a hill that went up and overlooked a valley. I was too young to notice anything about how the tracks crossed the fence and got to the road or if there was a piece of fur on the barbs, so Im sorry that I couldnt tell you anymore about that. On the other side of the road there were no tracks and we couldnt find any more around. <BR><BR>My father decided that we needed the camera, so I stayed at the fence while he went back the way we came to get back to the truck. It seemed like it took forever for him to return and being a little kid I was getting a little scared. But, he finally came back and told me that he could not find the truck! So when we were done looking around we took the road that we had found to see where it would lead us. It took us to a small town that we had passed to get to our spot. So we knew where we were form there and were able to finally get back to our truck and once we were there we decided we had gotten enough walking done for the day so we headed home.<BR><BR><BR>", :environment "The environment was desert like, with nothing big and no trees, but it was not flat.

I shined my light right at where I heard the sounds. Now both of the dogs were growling and pulling at the leash trying to get at whatever was in the forest. I looked around closely with the flashlight and then I saw something. A huge figure about 200 feet away from me was watching me and the dogs. It was kind of swaying between the trees and just staring right at me and the dogs. It looked like a very tall ape, but it looked more built like a human. <BR><BR>I was scared stiff and I must have stood there for a minute or two holding the dogs back and staring at the creature when it turned around and started walking away.

We arrived at the lakes at appx. 11 a.m. and fished until 2:30 p.m., at which time we decided to head back down the trail for home.  There were quite a few hikers in the area over the course of the day, appx. 13 hikers and a pack train consisting of 4 riders and 8 horses and a dog. Some coming in, some going out.  Anyway, we headed down the trail following the pack train.  We stopped on the way down to read the sign about the wagons that tried to use that trail way back in the day. I heard a noise like some one else coming down the trail behind us and told my family let''s get going.  The trail was pretty dry and dusty and my husband kept insisting that we give the hikers ahead of us some time so we could avoid walking in their dust. The next section of trail was slightly up hill so after cresting the top and going a short distance down the other side we stopped for a water break.  We heard what we thought was a shout, my son shouted back and something answered, but the echo was pretty bad, so we couldn''t make out what was being said.  We continued on down the trail and had just approached the south end of Leavitt Meadows, when my husband says \"What is that?\"  Both my son and I stopped and looked across the river toward the meadow.  From the beginning it was a strange sight, because this large black thing appeared to be floating across the meadow.  At first I thought it was a backpacker perhaps riding a bike, because it was moving so quickly across the meadow. It was moving quickly and smoothly.  It didn''t make sense.  If it was a back packer, to be moving that fast, he would have to be running and running with a back pack is anything but smooth; if he was riding a bike, then why couldn''t I see the bike and its arms and legs were in line with its body, not bent at an angle like it was sitting on something.  Also the color, I couldn''t figure out why a backpacker would be wearing black, black cap, black backpack, black pants, black coat.  It was at least 80-85 degrees.  We stood and watched silently for a time, perhaps 10-15 seconds.  The speed and smoothness with which it traveled was mesmerising.  Then my husband and son took off running further up the trail to another vantage point; they continued to watch it silently, then just shortly after I caught up to them, my son yelled, and the thing stopped and turned toward us.  It didn''t turn as a human would turn, even one wearing a backpack.  Then it began moving across the meadow again.  Not faster or slower, just the same floating type pace. <BR>We were on the trail above the meadow, looking down and appx. 500-800 yards a way from the object.  My husband believes the thing was following the pack trail. We left the trail and went down to the meadow.  We stayed on the trail side of the river.  The thing was on the opposite side of the river.  By this time it was gone or hidden from us.  The best way to describe it is like this.  The thing had a head that sat directly on its shoulders.  It did not appear to have a neck.  That is why we at first thought it was a backpacker.  It went head, broad shoulders or backpack, no neck, large body.  We could not discern its legs or arms due mostly to the angle at which it was leaving us. The grass in the Meadow obscured some of the legs.

It was late July of 1977. My family was up in the eastern Sierras, near Mono Lake, approx 13-15 miles above Conway Summit in an area known as Virginia Lakes. My dad told my brother and I to go to the lake and gather firewood. It was late in the day and the sun was down but it wasn''t dark yet, only dusk. I was 14 yrs old and my brother was 1 month shy of 16. He had his learners permit so we were allowed to take the truck.<BR>We got to the lake and started loading up some wood. I had just returned to the truck and dropped the wood when I heard, what I thought, was someone walking through the brush. The foot falls were very heavy, almost like someone was jumping, but the steps seemed pretty rapidly placed. Where we were gathering wood was near a large hedge of bushes, approx 6 to 7 feet high and very dense with only 1 path through the bush to skirt the lake without wading in the water. I turned to the bushes, where the sound was coming from, and saw the bushes shaking and bending, as if something large was moving through the bushes, making a lot of noise. I watched for a few seconds when my brother came running to the truck, white as a ghost and eyes bulging wide.<BR>I said,\"Jeff, what was that?\"<BR>He was scared and out of breath. \"I don''t know, but let''s get out of here.\" he said.<BR>We jumped back into the truck and drove all out. On the way back to the camp, he told me that he was only 10 or 15 feet away from it. He heard the stomping and crashing of the brush, and turned to see a large, dark-brown head above the bushes moving rapidly away from him. He didn''t see the face. <BR>He was so scared, he crashed the truck into a tree on the way back to camp. My dad was pretty pissed, to say the least, and didn''t believe our story, even when we were crying because of how frightened we were. He finally calmed down and said that we probably saw a bear. But, bears do not walk through heavy brush on 2 legs. And my brother swore that it was not a bear. I think my dad started to believe that we saw something since we both would not go out to the camp fire that night, and both of us refused to go to the lake alone for the rest of the trip.<BR>Since that time, I have told several people with very few people actually believing me. Most told me that big foot are only in the north-west in Oregan/Washington. But, after finding this website, I feel a bit vindicated.

I left my home in Manhattan Beach, California about 8:00 AM on the morning of February 16th after one last unsuccessful attempt to persuade my son to join me for a long weekend of wild pig hunting.  Monday was Presidents Day, my son was off school, and the Fort was open for hunting.  But 16-year old boys have other interests.  I arrived at the Fort about 12:30 PM alone, checked into Training Area 10/13 to hunt, and stopped at the Hacienda for lunch and to claim my room for the weekend.  After changing to camouflage clothing and hunting boots I headed up Sulfur Springs Road to where Training Area 10/13 begins.<BR><BR>About 4:30 PM I stopped to look at a creek that crosses under Sulfur Spring Road near Lyons Pond in Area 7 as I drove Northeast.  I learned of the creek that is often used as a wallowing spot, on a guided hunt in 1999.  From the road I could see much recent activity.  It appeared as though quite a few pigs had been wallowing in the small creek the night before.  I drove on about 150 yards and parked my Bronco along Sulfur Spring Road.  <BR><BR>I climbed down the 20-foot high embankment to the creek to check the area more carefully.  There were very fresh wallows all along the creek with many fresh droppings in addition. I walked on to Lyons Pond, which was dry, and returned to Sulfur Springs Road.  All of the fresh sign was in Area 7 at the edge of the road, but I was registered to hunt in Area 10/13on the other side of the road.  This is an important distinction at Hunter Liggett.  If you are caught with a loaded gun in an Area you are not registered to hunt, you are banned from the Fortforever.<BR><BR>I solved this conflict by noticing that the pigs appeared to be using a large culvert to cross under the road from Area 10/13 to Area 7.  I decided that I would wait for their return on the 10/13 side of the road.  I positioned myself about 10 yards off, and 20 feet below the road.  My hope was that the pigs would be traveling up the creek through Area 10/13 to Area 7 just after the sun set.  It was about 5:00 PM when I took my position with determination to not move until 30 minutes after sunset.  <BR><BR>The first hour of waiting was pretty boring.  Nothing was moving and the forest was eerily quite.  About an hour before sunset the woods began to show signs of life.  A few Blue Jays and Woodpeckers flew by and a few frog croaks resonated from the small creek I was watching.  Closer to sunset I noticed two does moving through the woods and squirrels scampering about.  I knew that if the pigs returned to the creek it would be in those magical 30 minutes after sunset and that time was just arriving!  <BR><BR>Much to my disappointment, a blue Ford Ranger also arrived as the sunset.  Two hunters climbed out, grabbed their rifles and walked down a small, grassy road that entered the woods about 75 feet from where I was sitting.  I watched them pass and disappear on the road that was slightly above my hidden sitting position.  My hopes of a pig encounter of the close kind were dashed.  I was certain these hunters would either intercept my prey or scare them away with their movement and noise.  <BR><BR>I was heartened a few minutes latter as I saw both hunters returning along the road to their truck.  I watched them carefully with my new Swarovski binocular.  It was about 10 minutes after sunset and without the binocular they appeared as shadows in the darkening forest.  With my Swarovski binocular I could see details of the weaving in the plaid hunting jacket one was wearing and the rifles they were carrying.  They climbed into their truck and drove offleaving me with 15 more minutes of wild pig hope.<BR><BR>These minutes passed slowly as I glassed the forest in search of movement.  The frogs in the creek began a loud chorus that added to the excitement.  There was lots of movement but no signs of pigs.  Chipmunks and squirrels were scampering about and I saw a coyote moving in the distance.  Drizzle started to fall, along with my hopes, as the last few minutes of hunting time expired.  I resolved to return to the same spot in the morning as I put the lens covers on my binocular and gather up my backpack and rifle.<BR><BR>But before I could stand up I saw a flash of light color a few 100 yards back into the forest.  I had no idea what I had seen out of the corner of my eye.  The color was white or silver-gray, not a color that I would expect to see on a wild pig.  I looked off into that direction for a few seconds before seeing another brief flash of the same light colored object.  Both confused and intrigued I watched as repeated flashes of white or silver-gray coloring appeared in the forest.  Whatever it was appeared to be moving and after about 20 seconds of watching I realized that it was moving in my direction along the same road the two hunters had walked earlier.<BR><BR>I believed I watched this creature move through the forest for about two or three minutes before I finally got a clear, unobstructed view of it against a light sky background.  My attitude was relaxed but attentive as I tried to figure out what I was seeing.  Patches of silver-gray flashed through openings in the forest, sometimes high, sometimes low!  My attitude changed to surprise and fright as I saw it take 4 or 5 full steps in a 30-foot clearing along the raised road, 75 feet from where I was sitting.  I was wide-awake, completely sober, free from any medications, and completely focused on this approaching object.  I was alone, watching with my naked eyes, and heavily armed.  I had a Model 70 in 300 Winchester magnum in my hands and was carrying a Tarus Raging Bull in 454 Casull on my belt.  <BR><BR>What the hell was it?  <BR><BR>I dont know!  <BR><BR>It was walking completely upright on two legs.  <BR><BR>It was very large.  I estimate that it was 8 feet tall and weighed 800 lbs.  Not 30 minutes before I had watched two hunters cross the same 30-foot opening and had thought how small they looked.  In contrast, I was surprised at how big this creature was.<BR><BR>It was covered with silver-gray hair from its very pointed head to its feet.  The only difference in coloration was a dark facial mask and similar colored palmsbrown or black.<BR><BR>I saw this creature in side profile and could make out few facial features.  What I could see appeared very flat, with little nose or chin protruding.  The silver-gray hair on the head rose about 8 from the top of the facial mask to a pronounced point at the top of the skull.  The head blended into the body without any visible neck in between.<BR><BR>The silver-gray hair on the arms was about 4 inches long.  I could see this clearly as these very long, heavily muscled arms swung in cadence with its fast, uninterrupted, strides.  Bulging back and shoulder muscles flexed visibly under the hair as it strode along the road.<BR><BR>It was not carrying nor wearing anything.  Both hands were empty.  There were no shoes, belt, pack or anything else that would suggest cultural development or advanced intelligence.<BR><BR>Four long, powerful strides in a clear opening against the still light Western sky and it was gone!  <BR><BR>I was dumbfounded!  What the hell had I just seen?  It took me about 10 seconds to grab my backpack and start running up the 10 grade to Sulfur Spring Road to get another look.  I slipped to one knee as I scrambled up the hill and pulled my Raging Bull out of its holster as I reached the road.  My heart was racing and my hands were trembling but it wasnt from the runningI was pretty damn scared!<BR><BR>It was 40 minutes past sunset, but I was looking West toward an open field on the other side of the road, the direction in which this creature was headed.  There was nothing movingI couldnt see or hear any sign of what I had just seen.  I walked slowly down the center of the Sulfur Spring Road toward the point where the other road connected.  I called out a number of times to see if anyone or anything would respond.  Nothing did.  After a few minutes I slowly walked backward down the center of Sulfur Spring Road toward my Bronco that was parked about 200 yards East of where I had been hunting.<BR><BR>I jumped in and locked the doors!  I turned it around and slowly drove back toward the Hacienda with the bright lights searching for any signs of movement along the road.  The drizzle turned to serious rain as I reached the Hacienda.  I went directly to the restaurant for dinner and a few glasses of wine.  I chatted with two other hunters seated at the same table.  We exchanged stories of seeing deer and fresh pig sign in the areas we had hunted.  They told me of seeing a flock of wild turkeys run across their path in Area 7, not far from the Hacienda.  I didnt say a word about what I had just seen.  I was sure they would think I was nuts.   I was sure because I was beginning to wonder myself!<BR><BR>It rained hard all night.  <BR><BR>A heavy rain continued until about 11:00 AM Sunday morning.  <BR><BR>I left the Hacienda an hour before sunrise on February 17th headed back to the spot where I had seen this unbelievable creature.  I parked in the same spot as the day before, and loaded my rifle and pistol before I unlocked the door as the sky began to gray in the East.  I watched the creek for pigs until about 30 minutes after sunrise, then began looking for footprints along the small road where I had seen what appeared to be a silver-gray Sasquatch.<BR><BR>The road was covered with grass and extended only about 200 yards from Sulfur Spring Road to where it dead-ended at a small ravine. There were few patches of bare dirt and no tracks.  Either the grassy road didnt show tracks or the rain had washed them away. Or, perhaps, there had been nothing to leave tracks in the first placeonly an over active imagination!<BR><BR>From the end of the road I slowly still-hunted toward an adjacent ridge.  It was a few hundred feet above the surrounding ground and offered a good vantage point to glass for movement.  While I kept my eyes open for pigs, I was really looking for something silver-gray.  I saw neither.  At noon, I returned to Sulfur Spring Road and walked back into Area 7.  Lyons pond had little new water in it despite the heavy rain over the last 18 hours.  There were few pig and deer tracks on the bare dirt as the heavy rain had washed most of the tracks away.  I saw no sign of any tracks that might have been left by the beast I saw the night before.  <BR>", :environment "The immediate area is a low lying wooded area along a small creek.

I was working for the US Forest Service on the Monterey Ranger District (Arroyo Seco Station). One the first things we had to do before the day began was go on a 2-mile fitness run. I dont remember the specific day. I began my run about 8:30 am about 3/4 of the way through the run I began to fall behind the crew. I came to area known as the Abbott lakes area. I stopped to catch my breath. I then heard a noise off to my left on the hillside. The hillside was covered with oak trees, poison oak and thick brush.  The side of the hill was shaded from the sun so I had really looked hard to see what was hearing. I noticed what appeared to a man walking up the hill about 20 feet in front of me. I then realized that this was to tall and to wide to be a person. It was about 8 feet tall. It stopped, turned its head and stared back at me for about 30 seconds. When it turned the whole upper body turned with head. I could not see its face because of the shade. It turned and walked up the hill. I ran back to the station knowing what I seen was not human.  Later that day I was with my supervisor alone and I asked him if he ever seen anything weird near the lakes or the bone yard (trash area). He looked at me and said \"oh you seen it to\" he later went on to tell that other members of forest service seen it to. He states that the season prior that one employee said he seen close up and it was covered with hair. I just blew it off. A month later I was placed on the night shift with one other person.  One of the things was to check the bone yard area for campers. One evening we drove into the bone yard and about 30 feet in front of us was a dark, 8-foot thing walking away from our vehicle.  I did not say anything to my partner until we drove out of the area. She turned to me and said, \"Did you see that?\" I then asked her what the hell is it. She told me she had seen several times in past.  That was the last time I seen it that season.<BR><BR>The 1995 fire season came around and due to budget problems only 3 people were on for the season. This made me nervous because this meant I would work alone 3 days a week. I avoided the bone yard area at all cost when I worked alone.  Halfway though the season a coworker and myself drove into the bone yard area to pick a picnic table.  My partner had a bad habit of wanting to catch a wild turkey for pet so as we drove up he took off running after a turkey that was about 40 feet from our truck. I did not see the turkey once I got off the truck but ran in the direction that my partner was running in.  As I got closer I realized that this was not a turkey we were chasing. As I got a better look at it I realized what I was looking at I only seen the upper body of it because it was walking down a slope. It had turtle shaped head and what appeared to be long tail coming from it. It moved at very fast pace away from us. I backed off, as did my partner.  I took notice of noise that it made as it walked away. I lost sight of it but I could still hear it running through the brush. That was my last season at this station.

We went to an area that had a little lake with an un-improved campground. My parents went up there that Friday morning and we went after work as Brian and I worked at the same place. We picked up Steve on the way out there. We got to the lake at around 9pm Friday night, and after setting up our camp, we sat and talked half the night. The camp was on the north end of the lake. There was a marsh area that had very thick underbrush to the immediate west of our camp. This marsh area extended to almost the southwest of the lake. If you picture a clock, the marsh area would be from the 8''0 clock to the 12''0 clock position. <BR><BR>After spending all day Saturday fishing with my folks and having a great time, we all settled down and relaxed at the camp. We had dinner and built a campfire and we all stared into the fire telling stories until my folks went to bed. At around midnight, Steve, Brian and I were sitting around the fire when I thought I heard something in the marsh area. It sounded like something walking through there. Steve didn''t hear it and I just dismissed it at first. But Brian and I kept hearing it. It soundedd like something going back and forth like it was pacing the camp. I knew no one was camped in that area, so I just thought it was an animal. This went on for about an hour and a half. I even jokeed to Steve that the tent he and Brian were sleeping in was just giftwrap to a bear if one came after them and I''d sleep really good in the back of my truck.<BR><BR>The next morning my folks decided to go home early. My friends and I decided to stay there a couple more days because Brian and I didn''t have to go to work until the following Thursday. By two that afternoon, we pretty much had the whole lake all to ourselves except for a couple of other groups of campers. At 2:30 Sunday afternoon, the three of us piled into my truck to hunt for firewood. We took a dirt road that went east to west along a ridge directly off of the lake''s entrance road about 1/8th mile from our camp. We were following this road in a pretty thick patch of woods for about a mile when it suddenly opened up into a meadow about 300 meters below the ridgeline of the hill we were on. There was another patch of woods to our south that paralleled the road for about 2 or 3 miles. I stopped the truck because we saw a ton of good firewood. <BR><BR>Brian and Steve went in a southeast direction away from the front of the truck while I grabbed my axe and headed in a northern direction towards some logs so we could get some \"all night burners\". I got about 30 ft from the truck when I saw it.<BR><BR>At first I didn''t know what I was seeing. It was a hairy thing sitting down against a tree with it''s back towards me. It was in the treeline we had just come out of. It was only 60 yards from me at most. I stood there frozen because I thought it might be a bear and I only had an axe and I didn''t feel like being any kind of hero. After maybe 5 seconds, it stood up on 2 legs. It looked massive, like 8 to 8 1/2 foot tall and at least 3 1/2 to 4 feet wide. It had reddish-brown hair all over it and it matched the color of the bark on the trees perfectly. It had huge hands that came down to just above it''s knees. It grabbed onto the trees just to guide itself through them, not push them aside. There were some pretty good sized trees in that patch of woods and they looked small when this thing grabbed them. It walked away from me towards the crest of the hill and I was amazed at how smoothly it moved. <BR><BR>It was weaving in and out of the trees stealthily and it never made a sound, not a grunt, not a wheeze, nothing. I didn''t even hear footsteps. As it got near the top of the hill, it stopped and looked down into the next valley to the North and it just walked on over the hill never even looking back at me. I couldn''t see it''s face. I didn''t see a neck either, just it''s head set kinda on top of it''s shoulders. <BR><BR>I stood there for about 10 seconds when I got the nerve up to get the hell out of there. I backed down the hill to the truck and I noticed that Brian and Steve were still gathering wood. I joined up with them after I got a soda from the truck and I calmed down. I gathered some wood with them and we got out of there. They never saw it. We stayed there another couple of nights, but we didn''t have another incident for the whole trip.

We had arrived early in the afternoon, set up camp, I shot a can or two with my pistol, ate dinner, and had settled in for the evening (it was about sunset), and we had heard this fairly high pitched \"moan\" or wail, that continued off and on throughout the evening. It seemed to be coming from up the hill at first, and if I had to guess, within 300 yards. Well, as time went on, we heard  the noise move down the hill and down the side of the mountain, which is extremely hard to traverse. My dad and I kept speculating as to what it was, as he had hunted bear, deer, and elk, and could not place what it was. We thought, from the tone, that it could have been a lost animal, as it had a mournful tone to it. It had a very resonant quality to it, like it was a good sized animal. Anyway, the noise seemed to move along the side of us, and then we would hear it back at its original location rather quickly. I briefly thought that it was a large bird that kept flying back and forth, but it finally dawned on my dad that there was two sounds; they seemed to be calling to each other; that unnerved me, and my father and I went to take a look with our spotlights and me with my pistol and camera (I always carry a little disposable camera in case I see a bear or deer). We walked up the hill, (on the dirt road), maybe 50 yards and saw nothing; when we got back to camp, I jumped in my truck and drove up the hill maybe 3-400 yards and saw nothing; I did not get out of my truck to look around as I was highly agitated (read:pretty dang spooked) I turned around and kept flashing my spotlight down the side of the mountain occasionally and went past camp down the hill on to Foresthill Road and drove up the road a little ways before turning around again and heading to camp. My dad and brother reported that they had heard nothing and it was quiet for awhile. I sat around the fire and watched the tv that my dad had brought with him; my brother was tired and had gone to bed fairly early. Everything seemed fairly quiet until I went to go \"number one\" by a big pine tree across the road and as I was juggling with the belt that was holding my pistol in its holster, I heard that noise behind the tree and it seemed like it was maybe 30 yards down the hill, it startled me, to say the least, and I ran back to the relative safety of the campfire holding up my pants with one hand and my pistol with the other, much to my dads amusement. Needless to say, I did not venture from camp the rest of the night. We continued to hear the noises until we went to bed, around 0330 or so, I remember hearing it around 0345 and yelling to my dad (he slept in the back of his camper, my brother and I in my tent, 15 ft away) \"there it is again!\", but he was sleepy. I finally drifted off to sleep shortly thereafter and no noise was heard again.<BR>THE \"NOISE\": Resonant.

He was disinterested and does not remember much.<BR>My fathers curiosity was piqued, but he was not agitated or spooked like I was; his philosophy is that humans are the most dangerous creatures out in the forest,and this was an animal, though he was not sure what it was and still doesnt. Also, he states that I heard brush or sticks being broken, but I cant recall stating that.

Later, we were all back and sitting around four different fires and talking about the day.  One by one we went back to our tents or cots and sleeping bags.  The last thing I remember before I went to sleep was both of the commanders talking about tomorrow''s set up and that was it, or so I thought.<BR><BR>Well, I was rolling over in my cot and slightly awake when, well for the lack of a better word, heard a \"howling sound\".  I, in all my life, have never heared anything like it before. It cried out eight or nine times . After a few moments there was nothing, so I got tired and went back to sleep, but only because the sound wasn''t too close to the camp.  It sounded like it came from where we where battling that day up on the ridge, about half a mile from us.<BR><BR>I woke up again about one hour later. I had to use the bathroom, I put on my boots and walked over to a bush to relieve myself, and on the way back I heard it again, but this time it was much closer.  It was right down the road from us and it was loud, very loud, and I know that this time I wasn''t the only one to hear it.   Several times it let out . one after another.  This time it was much more deep and clear to the ear. My unit commander and several of the other unit people woke up. To my and their knowledge, we didn''t know what to do . No matter what I did, I could not stay awake but before I went back to sleep, I loaded my gun with real bullets and put my bayonet under my blanket near my pillow. What ever it was, if it came into camp and hurt me or anyone, I was going to kill it.

We had quite a large fire lit at the time. Nothing was found. Approximately at 9:00 pm at night after dinner we were all around the fire cracking jokes and laughing quite a bit. We go on the trips to the Granite Basin area at least twice a year. My friend Mark owns mineral rights to several mines in the area. The area is catacombed with several mines. Also noted, the area has many streams and creeks with beautiful clear water. Also noted, this is a very healthy forest with much new growth.<BR><BR>Anyway, we were talking and laughing (my friend Mark is a loud person) and I have said that more than once how far I can hear him. All of the sudden he comes to me and says, \"Andrew, shut up and listen.\" Mark seemed a bit riled up so I did what he asked.<BR><BR>What I heard next, I will never EVER forget. It was this horrible screaming sound that I have heard before on my download from the Art Bell radio show. The one where you hear the sound he talks about saying, \"Bigfoot experts have confirmed this sound.\" And how \"you would never, ever, want to hear it in the dark of night in the woods.\" It was the SAME SOUND!!!  I am sure of it. Would stake my life on it. It was farther away than the screams on the recording and could be missed if you were to talk. But make no mistake, once we all shut up, and we did, we all heard this. It even repeated like the screams in the recording.<BR><BR>Someone suggested perhaps a coyote. No way, Mark and I are experienced woodsmen, and I have been inches away from bears while backpacking in Yosemite and have coyote''s where I live!  I know what a wolf sounds like. This was not even close to those sounds. Also noted, as soon as Mark originally told me to shut up and listen, we both verified the sound as being the one in the recording at the same time!!!  It was that unmistakeable. We have listened to numerous recordings and the one stated above is the only one that sounded like the calls, screams we heard that night. Also noted, the noise changed briefly on one call and sounded (don''t laugh) like someone strangling a cat.<BR><BR>Also noted, it almost seemed like it heard us because the sound would stop and someone would make a joke and we would laugh and then we would hear it immediately after making noise.  Also noted, could not judge distance but it seemed like it was a couple of miles away (just a guess). Also noted, the sound came from above the basin where we were. We had taken a 12-gauge [shotgun] out, and fired it twice after this went on for a few minutes. Heard no more sounds after this. We do not hunt animals (we do not believe in shooting animals) we target-shoot and go skeet-shooting. We would never ever want to shoot one of these animals, save of course using a camera.<BR><BR>Also noted, the night before, early in the morning, I heard what sounded like someone walking around our camp very softly and carefully. I did not even think about it at the time and it was too damn cold to even want to get out of my tent. No prints, smell, or any sighting was observed. I asked if anyone was out at the time and the answer was no. Also noted, I was pretty shaken after hearing this unnerving sound. I pretty much stayed by the fire the rest of the night. Looked often into the darkeness but saw nothing. No other animal sound was reported the rest of the night.<BR><BR>After I got home I played the sound to the rest of our camp group, they all verified that it \"sure did sound like what we heard.\" Although, some of the guys had trouble digesting this.

Five of those may have been hoaxed, but two deserve further discussion.<BR><BR>The first one occurred at 1:15 a.m. on February 13,1994. Mary and Jerry Cain, Quincy''s only bakers, were returning from Reno. Near Lee Summit, ten miles east of town, a large fur covered animal crossed Hwy. 70 in front of their car and strolled up a steep bank and into the forest. It looked exactly like the many drawings they''d seen of Bigfoot. They doubt this was someone dressed in a Gorilla costume. When it was light, Mary and Jerry returned to the scene and found large, deep footprints in the snow. They took pictures of the prints, wrote a narrative of their adventure and posted the information on the wall of their bakery.

I dont know the original author. <BR> <BR>I hiked to the bottom of the Middle Fork drainage where the Pacific Crest Trail crosses the river from the Quincy side (North side) so I could brush it out and cut some poles and logs laying across the trail. First day I had a couple guys with me, and we knocked out a good portion of it that day. I came back later in the week to finish up the remaining few miles by myself. <BR><BR>The tactic is to go down the trail heavy with water and saw gas and work your way back up getting lighter.  I worked my way down the trail maybe about 2 and a half hours to the area where we left off. I started cutting my way back up the trail.

This thing was EASILY able to outpace me even though it was working through steep rocky brush and tree covered terrain. At times it got ahead of me because of the contour of the land and that was a little bit horrifying. This thing was agile and fast.

I had drank no alcohol before going to bed so I slept fairly lightly.<BR><BR>I awoke at 4:50am. Just as I awoke, I heard a loud sound that seemed to me to be someone hitting a treetrunk with a large branch. I lifted my head in the tent and looked around for any light sources and saw none. I also heard no voices. I was intrigued enough to continue listening. Our closest neighbor had a Dachsund and the next closest had two larger dogs that were tied up outside their tent. Once I heard the first loud sound the outside dogs started moving around but didn''t bark. They made some moaning sounds but that''s all.<BR><BR>From what I could tell, as far as sounds, something or someone walked through the campground from lower to higher through a ravine. It had very heavy footsteps. It sounded like it broke fairly large branches on the ground. Once it crossed the campground''s asphalt, the neighboring dogs started crying, whimpering and moaning. I then heard what sounded like a rock or something similar, being thrown against a tree near our tent and falling to the ground. Right at the crescendo of the crunching branches I decided to get up and unzip our tent window and at the same time the tent of the owners of the dogs opened and a woman came out and grabbed the dogs to quiet them down. That was the last I heard of the crunching, footstep sounds. Also, there had been crickets making noise all night until this event. Once this started, the cricket noise reduced to only crickets at a great distance. By the end of the incident there were no forest sounds at all.<BR><BR>The next morning, we walked over to the ravine that I thought I had heard the biped walking through and found no footprints due to the extremely dry ground. I spoke to a family right next to the ravine and they had heard nothing that night but had heard footsteps the night before.

I''ve been Hiking, fishing, hunting, rock hounding, and Prospecting in just about all of California for the last 20 years, from the Cascades to Azusa Canyon. <BR><BR>On one of the nights, I think it was the 16th of November; we wanted to go on a night walk around Hemet Lake since the whole city of Idyllwild goes to bed at 8pm and it was about 10:30 at night, so we drove the 8 mile drive from our hotel to the lake. We arrived at the lake at about 11pm and sat on the car next to some big green trash bins about 150 feet or so from the lake; when we heard something 400 feet or so breaking branches in a canyon to our backs. It sounded big and didn''t seem to care if it was heard coming down the slope, so I assumed it was just a big black bear until the smell. The only way I could describe it was a dying wet dog. <BR><BR>A feeling of discomfort came over us both as we saw nor heard any more of what we assumed to be a big black bear coming down the canyon, meaning whatever came down the canyon was hiding in the tree line 300 feet or so away from where we sat. I got a chill up my spine and had that feeling that we shouldn''t be here right now. We got in the car and left to come back just under a hour later hoping what ever it was would be gone, so we could try to finally go on our late night lake walk. <BR><BR>We pulled up and backed into to the same spot as before to notice that one of the green trash bins had been pushed over towards the lake, and that there was a 2 foot wide 4 inch deep circular dent like something big had punched it. There was no paint smear like a car had hit it. It was and had been dead quite other than the unknown thing that came down the canyon about an hour before. <BR><BR>I had no idea what could have done that to a big steel trash bin and for years until Google Earth Mapping of Bigfoot.

San Jacinto, specifically Round Valley. This was the third year we had done this and the plan was to spent the night at 9200 feet and do the peak the next day. Spend another night in Round Valley and go back down the mountain the third day. The place we set camp was on the south east side of Round Valley with some large granite boulders to give us some shelter if the wind picked up. Surrounding our camp were ponderosa and jeffrey pines and not too far away was a small stream. This was early June and there were still some snow drifts in the shaded places.<BR>    My son and I had eaten dinner and were getting ready for bed. At about 10:00 p.m. we were in our sleeping bags, but still talking and planning the trip to the peak in the morning. Suddenly without warning we heard a loud, low pitched whooping call in the boulders just above us. The hair on the back of my neck stood up and my son asked me if that was a monkey and I, not wanting to deal with a panicked 7 year old, told him it was just an owl. We did not smell anything or hear footsteps. Everything calmed down and we finally fell asleep. About an hour later I heard a load boom that sounded close to the tent. I looked out the window in the tent and saw a few clouds in the moonlight so I pulled our boots into the tent in case we got a thunderstorm in the night.<BR>    The next morning we got up and had breakfast, then headed for the peak. We made the peak but by the time we got back to camp my knees were swollen and sore so I put some snow in a sandwich bag for a cold pack that evening to reduce the swelling for the trip out the next morning. That night was uneventful and we slept well in the high altitude air. The next morning we got up and began to pack up for our trip off the mountain. I went up on top of the boulders to make sure none of our trash had blown away from camp and make sure everything was picked up. I then saw what had made that load boom the night before last. 30 yards from our tent on top of those boulders was an 8 inch diameter ponderosa pine snapped off at the base. The tree was still green and fresh and had no rot in it and there was no wind to speak of either night. The only explanation I can come up with is that the animal that made that whooping sound had pushed the tree over. The tree was not aimed in the direction of our tent but rather parallel the direction our tent was pitched.

I used to live in Orange County California, and an old girlfriend of mine and I, were camping up in Dutchman&#8217;s Flats area, near Idyllwild. We were out-packing, not in a campground.<BR><BR>We were awakened by screams that resembled the sound of a pack of coyotes that had just made a kill right outside of our tent. The screams however had a bit of a deeper tone than a coyote. At the time that is what we thought it was, so we stayed quiet not wanting to interrupt a wild animals meal. The screams and screeches continued for what seemed like an hour, but was probably about 5 or 10 minutes. The screams stopped, but we could hear what sounded like heavy footsteps right outside the door to our tent. We could hear sniffing sounds, and heavy breathing sounds. That is when I got really scared. I know a coyote does not step like a 300+ pound man in combat boots.<BR><BR>I was too scared to even turn on my flashlight, and take a look. (Thinking maybe a bear had just run off what we thought were coyotes). We stayed up, paralyzed all night with fear until the sun came up. Even then there was still a dead silence. No birds, no crickets, nothing.  I was still scared to go outside, but did.<BR><BR>I could see that something was in our camp, due to the scattering of pine needles and dirt around our tent. But there was no sign of a coyote kill, like no blood or fur laying around. What I did see was a pair of big deep footprints going away from our site down into a deeply wooded ravine. The thing, what ever it was, walked upright, and had a 3 to 4 foot gait.  I followed the steps for a few yards down into the ravine while my girlfriend watched. It was still deathly quiet and I had a very eerie feeling that I was being watched. The footprints led right into a thicket and I could see it was a wide path left by whatever it was. I turned and ran back up the hill, packed our stuff up in a big hurry and left.<BR><BR>At that time I was in my early 20''s.

The berries run down to a thermal spring on the property that itself runs down to I creek, which is around 50 ft. further up the hill from that creek.<BR><BR>I thought this was a stray bird of maybe a tropical sort perhaps lost by someone. It would call to me in a guttural clicking sound followed by a series of sing song chirping whistles. I would call back, and then it to me and so on and so forth for around 20 minutes to 45 minutes before it would stop. It was always at dusk towards night and so I would call it a \"night bird\".<BR><BR>There have also been numerous times that I smell a strong wet garbage smell that shows up suddenly in my yard and house. The latest incident is taking place around every few days now, at least for the last three and one half months. This smell shows up in the late spring and usually stays around off and on through the last apples falling from the fruit trees on my property. I rent.<BR><BR>I have sensed something looking at me from the steep hill across the road from my house that comprises my back yard. Sort of like the feeling one gets when a puma is near. <BR><BR>The other night I had an incident where the creature I am talking about banged on my trailer at around four in the morning. When I went outside on the porch to see if it was somebody, I had every single hair on my body go up instantly. I just knew that whatever it was; was right there. I beat feet into the house and locked the door. The early morning smell was so strong that I couldn''t even sleep. It smelled like a garbage dump. I have been around lions and have had the hairs on the back of my neck go up, but never anything remotely like this.<BR><BR>I have heard very heavy thumps coming down the hill behind my house late at night many times during these same seasons. They sound like very heavy footfall. There is one particularly loud thump that I can hear that I think I have identified as this thing as it jumps from the road next to my house down into the my yard on its way to the creek.<BR><BR>I have seen it twice now. The first time was around four in the morning when I walked out of my trailer onto my front porch. The door squeals so it makes a lot of noise and when I opened it I must have startled the thing.<BR><BR>At first I thought I had just seen the biggest bear of my life until it registered in my head that it was running on two long legs, crouched over. I noticed that it was swinging two very long arms. It was the fastest moving animal I have ever seen. [In 2005] I reported it to a place here called J.Bs deli and was put in touch with [Carmine (Tom) Biscardi -- a.k.a. \"the Great American Bigfoot Research Team\"]. They came and investigated and now I have a live video feed coming from two spots near the creek.<BR><BR>The second time I saw it was at around one- thirty in the morning a few weeks later. I noticed the apple tree in the far corner of my yard going berserk. The big branches were really shaking hard. I had a night vision scope so I took it outside and looked through it but the tree settled down and I did not see anything so I sat the scope down. When I looked back over there I saw a human form from mid upper arm up walking towards the creek at the edge of the berry bushes. The bushes are around six plus feet tall, and this thing was perhaps two feet taller. I saw large rounded head on very large rounded, thick shoulders. It seemed to have very little neck. I could see that it was hairy and got quite a good view because it was silhouetted by a light on my neighbors porch.<BR><BR>My daughter was staying in a tent out in the yard a few nights later and was awakened by some whistling and then by something hitting her tent. Like something had been thrown.<BR><BR>There has been a print found on my property also. It is around 19 inches long and about 8 inches wide. I have never seen anything like it, but it looks like a giant human footprint to me.<BR><BR>These incidences are ongoing. I think this thing summers here. What do you think? Also, do you have any suggestions on your experience as to how I may be able to study it or observe it here?<BR>I would be delighted at any input. <BR><BR>Excerpts from Report # 12910                                           October 27, 2005<BR>OBSERVED: I have new possible evidence on the hill behind my house that I and a few friends of mine have found, and we desperately want someone more qualified to look at what we have here. I would appreciate talking to someone ASAP so that I can connect with you for a possible story.<BR><BR>For two years I have heard a whistle and chuffing sounds coming from the berries bushes in my yard. I thought it was some lost big tropical bird. I would call back to it, and it would call back, and so forth. I have had some bad odor incidences including one that woke me up from a dead sleep and gagged me.<BR><BR>A volunteer found a footprint up the hill behind my house and some friends of mine, [T. C.] and [N. M.] found additional footprints and hand prints in an area up the hill from my house that appears to be some form of crude camp. I have been there three times now and the second time I went there I observed that some 4-5 inches around 4-5 ft. long branches have been brought from some where other than that location and laid in a sort of rectangle fashion around a depression in the earth. There are more of these depressions without branch borders in the area. <BR><BR>There are snapped trees at @ the 10 ft. level; there are \"huts\", for a lack of a better term made from big branches. Some look older and some look recently made. There are also snapped trees and tracks that seem to form a path from this site down the hill towards my house. [N. M.] Found two pretty fresh handprints that appear to be coming out from one of the \"huts\". The finger tips are spread much farther a part than a human could have done. We found three separate footprints there that did not seem to be very old, maybe a couple of weeks, but no more.<BR><BR>I saw the Bigfoot three times now, once at 4 AM in the morning, and twice at 1 AM in the morning. It was very dark each time except once it walked in front of a light and I got a good look at its height and silhouette.<BR><BR>Excerpters from Report # 20720:                                        August 09, 2007 <BR>It was four thirty in the morning as I opened the sliding glass door to my trailer looking east towards my yard and I Creek; I thought to myself, that''s the biggest bear that I have ever seen. As it stood up from the blackberries in my yard it was eating, I saw two long arms and two very long legs. It began to run north towards the path I have that goes thru the berries to the creek, and I said to myself'' \"that''s not a bear\". I knew I had just seen a Bigfoot. WOW!!!<BR><BR>I saw it run towards the creek and I heard it crashing through the bushes down there. I did not follow. I''m not usually a scared kind of person, but I did not follow because I was scared. I had never seen anything like that in my life. I live in the woods and I have seen lots of bears and large animals. I  consider myself good at estimating, so I estimated it as 10 to 12 ft. tall and it probably weighed somewhere in the neighborhood of 1200 lbs. no lie.<BR><BR>Later that day I went down and looked on the trail the way it had gone. I found horse hair ferns that had been torn out from an area of about a thirty foot radius where something had torn them out and made a large \"bed\", for lack of a better word, there on the ground near a natural spring that comes out from under a maple tree. I walked down to the creek and found the tops of two very large footprints in the sand at the very edge of the creek. The prints disintegrated into the water as I watched them, but I was pretty freaked out by then.  <BR>          <BR>On with the story...<BR>Every night for a whole summer I would smell it in my yard, it smelled like a mixture of wet dog, garbage and sewer...if you can imagine that.<BR><BR>One night the smell woke me up gagging. I thought it was a bag of garbage I had left out on the porch that night. You see, it is so much easier to stay in a sort of denial when you see these things. It really is too hard to believe what you are encountering. Anyway, the cameras were up in my yard at that point and I had these computers in my house so I sat down at the computer and started looking at my emails. <BR><BR>There is a window right next to my sliding glass door where my porch and stairs are. I heard a small sound behind me at that window while my back was turned away at the monitor and when I looked I saw a huge dark face in that window. The face was tilted slightly and I could make out the shiny spots at the brow and bridge of the nose. It was very dark outside and what I saw was the reflection of the things face in the light from the dining room. I looked at it and it looked back at me for a few seconds and then it turned away. A few seconds later I heard a loud bang as it slammed something into the end of the trailer. I looked later and found a big dent.<BR><BR>I got up and ran out onto the porch. I actually thought it was pranksters. I got out on the porch and noticed how dark it was in the yard at that point. I yelled, \"Get out of here!\" I thought that would scare away any kids that might be in my yard when suddenly every hair in my body stood on end. Have you ever been around a lion when the hairs on the back of you neck stand up, Yeah kind of like that, but about 50 times stronger?  I suddenly thought...man, this thing is right here in the yard with me. I promptly panicked...ran inside...and locked my door.<BR><BR>A few nights later I saw it walk across my property. There is a field light across my property in my neighbors yard and I saw it backlit as it walked down to the creek. I saw a tall figure...@12 ft. tall with large mounded shoulders and a sort of conical shaped head. I saw very long arms swinging as it walked. I could only see the top portion of this guy because it was walking by 8 ft. tall blackberry bushes.<BR><BR>I went up on the hill behind my house with a friend and we found a footprint up there. It freaked me out too because I wasnt expecting to find anything to tell you the truth. We made a cast and I would very much like to have that cast. I heard it is in litigation.<BR><BR>I have been up the hill above my house since then and I have found places with big holes in the ground where \"beds\" have been made. Some of them have crude frames in them made from 12 inch diameter snapped off branches that are crisscrossed to form frames. I thought that was strange. In those places there are numerous foot and handprints.<BR>", :environment "There are two water features on this property that may be of interest.

Five years ago I interviewed a group of young people regarding a sighting. The sighting took place in the Mojave rive bed in Hesperia California. The first report came from five teenage boys who were exploring down in the riverbed late in the after noon when a noise in the dense under brush that grows in places along the river startled them.<BR><BR>They said the noise sounded like something big moving through it. When they moved closer to get a look they said they saw a large hairy ape like creature. As this frightened them, the boys ran home and told their parents, which is when I first heard the story. The boys father went down into the area of the sighting with a gun to see if he could see what the boys had reported, but found nothing. <BR><BR>The boys older sister rode her horse down to the spot on two consecutive days, to try and get a look at the creature. On the second day, her efforts were rewarded. In her statement to me she said, \"I was riding north in the river bed on my way home after searching for several hours, when I came to an area where there are two stands of cottonwood and pepper trees one on each side of the trail. My horse spooked and didn''t want to go on. I looked around and to my right I saw a tall hairy thing standing there looking at me. It looked at me for about a minute, then I turned my horse and ran her in the opposite direction and took another trail home.\" <BR><BR>I investigated the area and though I wasn''t able to see the Bigfoot itself, I did find what seemed to be a nest of sorts where the animal had been bedding down. I also found footprints that measured twenty inches by eleven inches. These prints were in very soft deep river sand so I''m sure the size is out of proportion, but maybe this will assist you in determining the animals size. When I asked the young woman about color she said it was a dark brown or black. I didn''t think about it after making my own documentation until I read the recent article in the Mohave Daily News Archives.<BR><BR> After reading the article I thought my information might be useful to you. My neighbor took some pictures of the footprints, and though they are of very poor quality I might be able to acquire them for you if you want.

Anyway in May 1982, while serving on active duty at Camp Pendleton, CA, I was temporarily assigned to a staff of Marines supervising a youth program consisting of a rigorous series of two week long mini-boot camps for teen-aged boys.<BR><BR>Camp Pendleton is flanked by the Pacific on its western flank and by the Cleveland National Forest [on its] northeastern flank. Three different Mt. ranges intersect the base itself and I am very familiar with every nook and cranny on its over 200,000 acres of mountains, ridges, ravines, canyons, trails, back roads and the like.<BR><BR>Anyway on one particular calm night after a long grueling day of forced marches, displays and demonstrations we took all 300 boys up to a bivouac site for the night. The site is situated on large, open meadow shelf above the Infantry Training School at San Onofre/52 area. The boys were exhausted yet eagerly setting up their shelter-halves. They began to get a little too loud, so I began to quiet them and bed them down for the night. The rest of the staff was situated about 35 meters away, up on a little knoll that overlooked the boys. However, I wasn''t aware that the staff had already bedded down and that I was the last one still up except for the radio watch, which was half asleep too.<BR><BR>It had become dark with exception of a bit of starlight, which gave me a very good range of vision. Finally I succeeded in getting the kids in the sack and quiet. I then stood for a few moments to ensure all was secure and that not one peep could be heard and none could be.<BR><BR>As I turned facing west and looked towards the closest edge of the perimeter I noticed a tall, dark, bulky figure standing about 15 meters beyond the last tent or 20 meters from where I stood. We seemed to be staring at each other, but it&#8217;s hard to say because I could not make out any of its facial definition, but I had a strong gut feeling that it was checking me out real good since I was the only thing moving around. I could feel my heart begin to pound and my entire body felt like it wanted to anchor to the ground. There was no doubt someone or something very odd and dangerous was standing there looking at me. I mean this thing was TALL and wide at the shoulders.<BR><BR>I used my peripheral vision to make sure I wasn''t seeing things, but it only confirmed what I already knew. It gently and slightly moved its upper body left and right ever so slowly as though looking around to its front, surveying the area. It was an easy 8 feet tall. Like I mentioned previously, all I could make out was its massive silhouette and no real detail features. It had very broad shoulders, little or no neck, dark, and looked very powerful.<BR><BR>I decided to go get a flashlight out of our vehicle at the top of the knoll and let staff know what was going on. So I began to cautiously and quietly step backwards to prevent whatever it was from charging or coming into bivouac. I continued to keep an eye on the dang thing, which just remained in the same spot. Almost halfway up the knoll I lost sight of it, but I continued to move slowly still trying to locate it. From atop of the knoll it was very difficult to see anything clearly outside the fringe of perimeter because of the dark.<BR><BR>I walked back down to the tents, scanned the area with the flashlight, but didn&#8217;t see anything like I had before. The figure had obviously moved. So instead of waking anybody up I sat up for a while and waited to see what and if anything would happen. I also hoped the darn thing wouldn''t pop up behind me (we were all unarmed). It would have been worse and maybe a calamity if I had  pushed the panic button and had waken everybody up. After all, we were in charge of nearly 300 young street kids without any formal training, out in the open and I didn&#8217;t need the grief if nothing I said or described could have been verified. Thankfully nothing else occurred that night.<BR><BR>In the morning just before daybreak I bee-lined for the spot where I saw the thing standing. There wasn''t anything there ... nothing. Not a pole, a bush, a tree, a reed.  I mean nothing that could have simulated what I had seen. We were situated on flat, clear open ground with exception of the knoll and a tree line about 50 to 60 meters away and a mountain behind that which I knew all existed and had seen back-dropped way beyond the figure the previous evening.<BR><BR>The ground was grassy, but was already pretty well matted down and rutted by the constant foot and vehicle movement in that particular training area. I know I saw something that wasn''t normal. I know  it wasn''t hoax, I know it wasn&#8217;t the kids (they were all accounted for). I trust my judgment and I&#8217;m now 46 years old and still have perfect vision. I know it wasn''t any of the staff because I had seen all of them sleeping when I got up the hill. At that time I had nearly 11 years of active military service in the infantry and had done plenty of night OP''s [ed: Observation Posts] to know how to use my eyes in the dark and to know the difference between a bush and a moving object. This was BIG, and real! Oh, and the thing was very quiet, I didn&#8217;t hear it make a sound.

Now, in the Lagunas around Julian, in San Diego County, I have been actively pursuing reports of Bigfoot in these mountains and the Anza-Borrego Desert below, and most particularly within a certain Indian Reservation. In February, 1981, I happened to be at the right place at the right time to meet a young Indian who talked openly of his interest in Bigfoot and said he had seen him on his reservation and knew the location of caves where Bigfoot hid, and he would take me there - now!<BR><BR>He guided me up a fearfully storm-wrecked road. My ancient van was not designed for such, nor my senior years to cope, but once started there was no turning back. Disaster seemed certain but I would die TRYING! We reached a small flat. \"Park here,\" my escort said. \"Now we hike down a canyon.\"<BR><BR>He hiked ahead rapidly and I eventually caught up with him - napping under a bush. Below him, a small stream followed a darkened canyon around a bend. I had parked in bright sunshine and in less than a mile we had descended into sunless gloom. \"The caves are over there, but I am NOT about to go there.\" <BR><BR>Until my guide refused to enter a taboo area, I had not really believed his story. I knew that no money or incentive on earth will induce an Indian to enter taboo ground. \"Okay, now we wait. Have a seat.\" I said to him, \"What are we waiting for?\" He said, \"To watch. He comes out this time of the day and walks around. He drinks from those old rock-troughs I showed you by the road. Sometimes he hangs out by that wrecked house where the road loop starts. You in a hurry?\" <BR><BR>I told him no, but that I was not about to drive back down the road in the dark. We hiked back to my van which was completely concealed in the brush until you reached the road. It was dusk when I drove out of the Reservation. <BR><BR>After a week of heavy storms had eased up, I sought out my Indian escort. Unlike before, he was neither friendly nor talkative. Briefly I was then told, \"My people are complaining. Our tribal spokesman is very displeased. You will not be welcome to return, with or without your friends - and <BR>trespassers risk being shot.\" So, I backed down for awhile - but I was not \"out.\"<BR><BR>For three months I planned for a return trip. A friend obtained permission from a well-known Indian to drive up the mountain just to take pictures, to stay on the road and not to wander around the reservation. I had studied the map well but a certain hunch compelled me to request we reverse our direction. After a steep turn, we were blocked - but good - by a heavy pick-up in the road next to a parked bulldozer. In front stood five Indians - shoulder to shoulder, spanning the road, with their backs to us.<BR><BR>\"Looks like we''ve got trouble,\" my escort said, very quietly. He stepped out with a cheery greeting and, as a Forest Service firefighter, was recognized. Two men approached me. \"You see Bigfoot this morning?\" They knew who I was. \"No, and I came up here just to shake hands with him.\" That brought welcomed laughter, then a statement, \"I have seen him. He comes up from the canyon below the flat you just passed. He doesn''t come out very often.\" <BR><BR>This confirmed what my first Indian guide had told me. The \"sticky\" situation was smoothed out but not to the extent that we could continue to explore.

Doug Huse, San Diego County Sheriffs Department<BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Okay, just go ahead and tell me about yourself, when you started working there and so on. <BR><BR>HUSE: I started working the Alpine area (east of San Diego, California) in March of 1970. I came to the department the previous year. I was working out there in a patrol capacity for the San Diego County Sheriff''s Department I was a deputy at the time and actually worked Alpine for about 2 years, from March of 1970 to April of 1972. As far as trying to recall exactly when this went down, the best I can come up with is that it was after the Laguna fire of 1970 ... September of 1970. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: The Laguna fire affected which areas?<BR><BR>HUSE: Well, it was the largest brush fire at the time in California history, and burned specifically in the Sweetwater River area from east of Alpine all the way south and west, probably another 15 miles. It was quite an extensive burn and through the area in question, Alpine, on the south side of Interstate 8. To recall the chain of events, it was extremely cold which means the time of year would''ve been sometime after September of 1970, probably December or January, maybe February...let''s see, that would be 1971 ... well, it was definitely winter. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Was that about the time of your first contact with the key witness, Dr. Baddour (prominent San Diego psychiatrist)? <BR><BR>HUSE: Yes, and I don''t recall the reason, but Dr. Baddour was stopped by a two-man patrol unit. Baddour was traveling eastbound, which would''ve been from the San Diego area to what we learned later was his home in Alpine. On the front seat of his car, I don''t remember what kind of car it was, he had a loaded .44 magnum revolver with a 6-inch barrel. That''s the same type of gun that Dirty Harry made famous. It''s the largest caliber hand gun you can buy. Of course this piqued our interest a little bit. I wasn''t the contact, I was what we call the cover during this particular stop. My partner''s the one who made first contact and found the gun. He secured the revolver and was asking the doctor, who''d identified himself as Dr. Baddour, why he was carrying the weapon. Baddour said it was because of a ... and I don''t know what he actually said at the time, but my partner heard him say, \"Zoobie,\" ... and so from there on all our conversations throughout the department referred to whatever Dr. Baddour had seen as a Zoobie. That wasn''t what the doctor actually called it, I don''t believe, but that''s what my partner heard and that''s how the name got coined.<BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: At the time did Dr. Baddour describe this Zoobie to the officer? <BR><BR>HUSE: Yes, he did, to both of us as a matter of fact. He described the Zoobie as a large, upright, walking hairy creature. Dr. Baddour convinced us and later other members of my department, including one of my patrol sergeants, that in truth he''d had three separate encounters with the Zoobies. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Did Dr. Baddour say how many of these Zoobies there were and where the sightings happened? <BR><BR>HUSE: Yeah, one sighting was made by his entire family within the confines of his yard and immediate area, and at one time they saw three Zoobies. What Dr. Baddour described to us was what he assumed was a father, mother and child with the largest of the Zoobies being over 6 feet tall, maybe 7 feet tall. The tallest was very hairy and much larger-framed than an ordinary man. What he described as the mother was about 5 feet tall, and the smaller one was about 3 or 4 feet tall. Like I said, the doctor convinced a number of us that he''d in fact seen something unusual. What happened then was that we did get involved in an investigation of the sightings. I did because of the shift I worked which was either 10 p.m. at night to 6 a.m., or what we called the evening or overlap shift which was from 6 p.m. to 2:30 in the morning. Neither of those shifts was conducive to interviewing citizens in the area, so I wasn''t able to locate other witnesses, and I can''t recall if I ever talked, to a deputy who canvassed the area looking for witnesses. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: How many people lived in the area at the time? <BR><BR>HUSE: There were very few homes, probably 5 or no more than 6 residences, and Baddour''s was the last home on the narrow road. Going back in my memory 20 years now, I''d say his house was a quarter to a third of a mile off the main road used to get to his place, almost in a straight line due south of Alpine Blvd. That area hasn''t grown much since then, no planned residential development in there. At that time the Baddour family themselves consisted of the doctor, his wife, a daughter and a son. The daughter was 17 and the son was younger, maybe 13 or 14. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Can you describe what the terrain looks like, is it actually alpine forest, etc.?<BR><BR>HUSE: It''s not a forest by any means, the elevation''s no more than 2300 feet. The road goes east and up, and in about another 20 miles it eventually climbs to about 5000 feet. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Does it continue up into forested areas? <BR><BR>HUSE: Yes it does and it follows the Sweetwater River it''s about 10 miles. The Sweetwater River isn''t much of a flowing river. It runs about three-quarters of a mile south of Dr. Baddour''s place. Of course it always depended on rainfall, but the river hasn''t run continuously anytime in the 20 years I''ve been familiar with the area. There''s no snowfall at all. The terrain itself is quite steep behind Dr. Baddour''s property, going down into the (Sweetwater) river bottom itself. It''s all primarily brush and chaparral.<BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Any bears in the area? <BR><BR>HUSE: I don''t think I''ve ever heard of a bear sighting in San Diego county, and again I''ve been in the area almost 23 years. We have deer everywhere here along with coyotes and fox and other types of wildlife, but no bears. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: What else do you remember about Dr. Baddour''s sightings? <BR><BR>HUSE: Let''s see, the first set of circumstances I remember was Dr. Baddour finding damage to the house when he''d just moved in. He said he bought the house from an older German couple and all of the light bulbs, inside and out, were the yellow bug repellent type. Baddour said the German man told me that he shouldn''t change them to white, that he should get used to the yellow light.<BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Because of an insect problem? <BR><BR>HUSE: Baddour said the German was very evasive about that, evasive also about a lot of details regarding the house and property. The property did have some acreage, I don''t recall the size but it was larger than a city lot anyway. The property had some fruit trees in the front and back yards. I don''t remember what kind of fruit trees they were, but the house and trees were surrounded by a fence. One of Baddour''s complaints was that fruit was being picked off the trees at the tops, but not from the bottoms. The trees were upward of 7 or 8 feet high, or maybe 10 feet high. Anyway, the fruit was disappearing from the tops of his trees and his fence was getting knocked down. He had a wind chime at one of the doors made of brass or some kind of strong metal which frequently rang in the blowing wind, and at one point the wind chime suddenly turned up flattened. Baddour couldn''t explain it and we couldn''t duplicate it. It was smashed. Baddour did make a plaster cast of a footprint and I know we had photographs of it, if we didn''t in fact have a plaster cast of the print ourselves. But I do recall there was a plaster cast. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Do you remember the approximate size of the footprint? <BR><BR>HUSE: I''m 6-foot-3 and I wear a size 12 shoe, and I''d have to say this one was larger than my shoe and much wider than my foot. I''d say it was about 13 or 14 inches in length, and I''ve been wracking my brain trying to remember if it had 4 toes or 5 toes, but I just can''t recall.** <BR><BR>[**According to researcher, Ken Coon, who visited the Alpine area in 1971, Dr. Baddour''s \"Zoobies\" left V -shaped, 4-toed footprints, 16 inches long and 8 inches wide with the widest measurement across the toes. The foot narrowed down to 5 inches at the heel.]<BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: But there''s some recollection that it might have had an usual number of toes? <BR><BR>HUSE: Yes, I do seem to remember that, but I can''t bring it to mind. I know the footprint was wide overall, and less wide at the heel, but the heel was still wider than a human foot would be. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Did you or any of the officers talk to the doctor''s wife or kids?<BR><BR>HUSE: Specifically the word came back to me, and I''m not sure which deputy found out, but the daughter said she had a sighting in the early morning hours as she boarded a school bus at Alpine Blvd. That would have been adjacent to the access road leading to the Baddour house. She was getting on the bus and spotted the creature off in the brush. There''s some very thick, very tall brush along the road there. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Do you remember any details of what she saw? <BR><BR>HUSE: No, not really, the man who was deeply involved in this was my patrol sergeant and he''s now deceased. He was so involved with it that on his days off he''d go up there and camp to the rear of Baddour''s house. He''d take his older son along and the two of them would camp out in hope of getting a glimpse of one of the Zoobies. They never did. But he was the man who probably had more conversations with the doctor than any-body else. Another sighting involved three Zoobies sighted by a whole family. The Baddours had made it a habit to never go out after dark, but one night they were out with the son to call in their pet dog. In the dark the boy thought he saw the dog near a comer of the house and called out to It. Well, the dog came running back, but from a different corner, and what at first they thought was the dog turned out to be the smaller Zoobie. Apparently it had been laying down and it got up and stood and walked the opposite way, joining the other two, the larger male and female, and they all walked off into the brush.<BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Did they ever use words like \"ape\" or \"gorilla\" to describe the creatures? <BR><BR>HUSE: No, they never did. Baddour was firm in his own mind that it wasn''t an ape or gorilla. It was something totally different than one of those. Well, for lack of anything better we thought it to be more like the California Bigfoot, based on how it was described. Whether it was black or brown I really can''t remember.<BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Did Dr. Baddour ever use the word Bigfoot or Sasquatch to describe the Zoobie? <BR><BR>HUSE: Not to me, no. As a matter of fact we were assigned to make periodic checks of his residence throughout the night because most of the damage to his property was done during the night time, so my partner and I in a two-man car would drive up there and shine the spotlight around his house. Dr. Baddour was very convincing. I can still picture him coming outdoors one night dressed in his skivvies and wearing black high top military boots. That was it, a tee-shirt and shorts with those black boots and carrying that big .44 magnum. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: How would you characterize the family, it sounds as though they were all educated, credible people? <BR><BR>HUSE: Yes, I''d characterize them as exactly that. I got the impression the daughter was very intelligent, and of course Baddour himself was a medical doctor, a psychiatrist. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: In our earlier phone call to arrange this interview you mentioned something about the creatures, the Zoobies, mimicking human speech ... ?<BR><BR>HUSE: Yes, one of the lighter stories I recall happened when the doctor got home after dark one night. They had chickens there, and earlier he''d called his wife to say he was going to be late and to remind her to feed the chickens before night fall, which she did. When the doctor got home he had to exit his car, open the gate, drove through and stopped, then got out of the car again to close the gate behind him. He said that when he went to close the gate that night he heard a very low, very guttural voice say, ''Here chicky, chicky, chicky...'' <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: That''s funny and not unprecedented in the research. Are you saying the impression was that one of the creature''s was imitating the doctors wife who''d called in the chickens earlier?<BR><BR>HUSE: Exactly. It was the doctor''s opinion, and we had no reason to doubt him, that the Zoobie had some type of intelligence and the capability of producing sounds like that. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Did they ever describe any other sounds or smells, anything like that? <BR><BR>HUSE: Smells, yes. A very pungent odor, maybe like rotting garbage. You know, he did tell us he''d set up cameras around the house with trip-wires, but he wasn''t able to get any photographs, at least not while I was working the area. I really can''t recall but I know the doctor himself had a close sighting of one of the Zoobies, and there were probably other sightings, but I can''t remember now. Of course I worked up there for just those two years, until April of 1972. After that I went to fly helicopters. So I was completely out of touch with what was happening in Alpine, and I didn''t get back there until 1981. At that time I was stationed east of the Baddour home, and I didn''t hear anything more. I did hear something about the Proctor Valley Monster when I started patrol in 1970, which if true I''d have to assume was on the order of what Dr. Baddour was describing. Now, a few years ago a deputy told me he saw a dark-colored, large, upright furry creature, not a bear and not human, up in some rocks north of Interstate 8, and possibly northwest of El Capitan (reservoir). The deputy told me it was a good distance away.

Near that point and about 3/4 to one mile away from the ranger station located there, my friend and I hunted along the west side of the road.

Nothing was observed.<BR><BR>About 5-10 minutes later, we climbed back up the hill and onto the trail only to find some footprints.

First I must say that I don''t think a bigfoot lives real close to where I live but I do think we live within it''s (plural) normal range or migration route. <BR><BR>The first sighting was in 1998 in the winter, we are not really sure...  My brother was driving home and was on our private driveway when he drove by something that he could not describe.  He walked in andsaid he had just saw a bear or a big black person wearing animal fur, or a cow...  Basically his mind could not fit what he saw into any specific category  and he was very confused.  Upon questioning him he said it looked like a homeless person wearing animal skins.  He said they passed right by eachother going in opposite directions.  Since our road is a graveled one lane road they must have been within a couple of feet from eachother! He told me it had just happened so we went to investigate.  I was thinking there was a homeless person passing through... But then we turned a corner and I saw the footprint from about 50ft away!  I was so amazed that I stopped my truck and got out and immediately took off my shoe and sock to compare sizes...  I was not thinking about a bigfoot, it didn''t really cross my mind until a couple of years later actually...  I was still thinking it was a homeless person with huge barefeet!  I''m a size 12, I put my foot inside this track...  It was 4-6 inches longer and 3-4 inches wider than my foot.  And it was sunk into a hard pack dirt road about an inch or more.  Being 200lbs myself, I jumped around trying to make an impression an inch deep in this strata but to no avail.  I couldn''t sink my own track at all! I mean no inches, nada!  So now I was thinking about a homeless person wearing animal skins with huge feet and that was significantly heavier than me...  But there were two problems to this obvious bigfoot sighting (in hindsight)... Number one, bigfoot do not live so far south in California (or so I thought), and my brother did not come in and say, \"I just saw a bigfoot!\"  So it never occurred to either of us that this was a bigfoot sighting!!!  It wasn''t until a couple of years later that I asked him if what he saw could have been a bigfoot and he said,\" oh yeah, that makes sense now...\"  It took us awhile to put 2 and 2 together but we finally did with the help of this website.  I found it while web surfing and his sighting started to make sense...  Then I became more aware of my surroundings in relation to bigfoot.  We live in a typical second growth redwood forest with all the typical animals that I see quite often.  But I was never looking for bigfoot until now.  <BR>2004 was an exciting year.  We had 2 more sightings and a very loud vocal performance!  So, I was watching tv outside in the covered porch/ gazebo.  If you turn down the tv you can hear all of the night sounds as if you were outside.  Around 11:30ish pm  I heard something so I turned the tv off.  I then heard a very loud screaming roar right in front of my house.  And judging from the location of the first sound I heard that was distorted by the tv, I deduced that whatever this was was walking down my driveway and was very close!  It roared twice more while following the road.  I was dumbfounded!!!  And then I got scared... I''ve lived in the woods my whole life and think nothing of walking around in the dark with out a flashlight.  You couldn''t have dragged me outside at this point!  I''m 6''3, 220lbs, and this thing sounded huge. I compare the roar to the decibel level of a siren!  It just echoed off the hills.  I have compared it to the recordings on this sight and it is very close to the Washington recordings, especially the one from 2005.  I am so glad that my dad and mom both heard this!  It just gave you the impression that it had huge lungs to make such a loud noise!  But interestingly enough the last roar was ended with two very clear dog barks that I presume were mimicked...  All of the dogs in the vicinty were going crazy except the dogs that were the closest to where this thing had traveled...  <BR>Two nights later was the second sighting.  This time it was in the front yard of my Dads house.  I was leaving in my Suburban.  I was just edging down the driveway when I got something out of the corner of my eye.  I turned and looked at what appeared to be a large pile of redwood bark lying in the yard as if my dad had cut down one of his trees and had raked all the bark into a pile.  Redwood bark is reddish...  As I passed slowly by I realized that my dad had not cut down any of his trees and that there would be no reason for a large pile of redwood bark to be piled there.  What I have deduced is that a bigfoot was balled up hiding from me!  And it semi worked.  There was a fence between us and if I were in a smaller car I wouldn''t have seen it, but I was very high up in a raised Suburban so I could see over the fence.  It looked as if it was on it''s knees hunched over with its head on the ground and it''s arms over it head.  I say semi worked because I kept driving and didn''t realize what I had seen until a couple of minutes later.  When I went back my pile of redwood bark had disapeared.  I was so disapointed because I was only about 15 ft away! The next sighting I again missed out by seconds!  My wife and I were driving on our driveway and she said she had just I contact with someone...  I had driven about 30 more ft and stopped. I asked her and she said she saw a dark face with deep inset eyes and a shaggy head looking at her from behind a tree.  The windows of the car were still dewed up from the cold morning so I backed up and got out.  I heard bi pedal footsteps walking away through the oak leaves.  It was a very definitive sound...  I would have followed if I was not in business clothes...<BR>So I think a bigfoot or more lives in the area.  There are 60-70,000 acres near by and I believe we are in a corner of their range that they visit every once in awhile since the occurances are not everyday.

I was 17 at the time, and would regularly take time off from high school with my parents permission to go on camping trips as long as I kept my grades up.  I do not remember the exact date''s as it has been nearly 26 years since the trip. <BR><BR>My friend and his brother had camped at the area the previous year in the Trinity Alps.  We departed from our homes in Whittier and Pico Rivera, Ca. in a newer model popup camper Volkswagen bus driven by one brother, and a ''69 VW bus driven by the other brother.  Since I was not driving I do not recall the highways or road to the campground that we took, and I no longer have contact with my friend and his family. I remember it took around 10 hours to get there.  We had to turn off the main highway on to a dirt road that we had to drive approximately 10 to 15 miles in order to reach the campground.  On the way to the campground on the dirt road there was patches of snow on the ground but the road was very drivable.  <BR><BR>About 8 miles on the dirt road we saw an older model VW Beetle coming towards us and we flagged it down, so we could ask the driver what the conditions were like at the campground.  The driver was alone and appeared to be in his mid to late 20s.  He had long hair and a beard and he appeared to be very nervous and distracted when he spoke to us.  He said, \"that the fishing was good along the river\" and thats about all I remember him saying besides \"good luck and for us to be careful\" before driving off.  The whole conversation only took about 2 minutes.  We continued on towards the campground and I remember us kidding to each other how weird the guy had acted as if something had frightened him. <BR><BR> When we got to the camp area we saw that there was no other campers around and no sign of any recent visitors.  We set up camp by parking the ''69 VW parallel to the river about 25 feet from the bank that led to the river and by parking the other bus the other way about 20 feet away from the ''69 bus with the fire ring between the two vehicles.  The popup VW was parked with it''s rear bumper facing the base of a long hill and the front facing the river about 45 feet from the river.  The campground was in a very remote and densely forested area nestled between large mountains in every direction.  <BR><BR>We set up camp and decided to go for a hike.  We hiked about five miles into a very primitive area along a trail that was hard to follow in some areas.  After awhile we came upon an old cabin.  The cabin appeared to be abandoned for some time by the shape it was in.  One of the brothers was able to get the door open and we all went inside.  There was a few old cans of food, an old rusted shotgun, old blankets, and an old gas lantern.  There were rodent droppings throughout the cabin, and we figured that it possibly was used by seasonal hunters.  We closed up the cabin, and continued our hike.  It was getting late so we decided to sleep under the stars that night instead of hiking back to the campground in the dark. I remember that it was one of the coldest nights I had ever been through as my frozen boots that I had left outside of my tent attested to in the morning.  <BR><BR>We hiked back to our camp the next morning, and prepared breakfast, and just kind of relaxed all day.  Later in the afternoon we took our guns out, and had target practice on some tin cans.  At night we made a huge fire in the pit, listened to music on the tape deck and talked about the day.  We all headed for bed around 9:30 or 10:00 that night. The cousin and I slept up in the canvas pop-top of the bus, while my friend and the older of his two brothers slept below on the foldout bed.  The other brother slept with his dog in the other bus. <BR><BR> Around 10:30 I remember I was almost asleep when I heard a noise coming from far above on the hill next to us.  I then heard something moving at a high rate of speed coming down the hill towards us.  Suddenly the whole bus started rocking back and forth from side to side and at one point I thought it was going to tip over.  I remember hanging on tight and then worrying that if the bus did roll over that I may be crushed if the popup collapsed so I dove for the floor of the bus, and a second later the cousin landed on top of me.  The bus stopped rocking suddenly and I remember hearing over our screams a lot of noise just outside of our vehicle.  We then heard yelling coming from the other brother in his bus and his dog barking like crazy.  We tried looking out the windshield and the side windows but it was iced up and fogged up from the cold.  In a second it was dead quiet again.  We rolled down the passenger side window and called out to the other brother if he was ok.  He said that he was and we all slowly got out of the buses.  The brother in our bus had grabbed his 44 Magnum, and led the way out.  The first thing I noticed was that all of our backpacks had been flung about the camp and that my pack and the cousins pack had been torn open and the contents of our packs was strewn everywhere.  We left everything where it was, and we all crammed into the popup bus for the rest of the night.  Needless to say we barely slept that night. <BR><BR> The next morning we cleaned up the mess outside, and speculated on what could have attacked us. The whole attack lasted only a few minutes.  We ruled out a bear because there were no bear tracks. And a bear would have still been in the area.  I climbed the hill behind our bus that I heard whatever it was that had come after us, and I noticed long skid marks that started higher than I could climb, but I saw no footprints.  I tried to match the stride of the skid marks coming down the hill but couldn''t because of the steepness of the hill and the space between the skid marks. We went on with our day by preparing and eating breakfast, and later going for a short hike, and again shooting our guns at targets.  I think that we were all a little edgy after the attack, and I know I kept looking around and over my shoulder whenever possible. <BR><BR> Later that night we again sat around the campfire, and listened to music, and talked.  And again we went to bed around the same time.  We kept the same sleeping arrangements and I remember being jumpy at every little sound that I heard outside.  Once again I remember that I was almost asleep when again I heard a noise coming from high above us.  I then heard something rolling down the hill towards us, and the back of our bus being hit by some large object.  I remember all of us saying something like \"oh no, not again\".  I then heard the same sounds as the night before coming fast at us from the hill.  This time I didn''t wait, and I dove for the floor, and again the cousin landed on top of me.  And once again the bus started to rock violently from side to side for about 30 seconds.  My friends brother had kept his 44 near him, and he was waving it around at the windows, and I remember thinking that one of us may get shot by accident.  When the shaking stopped we again heard the other brother yelling from his bus and his dog going nuts.   We tried to see through the iced over windows again with no success.  We exited our bus as soon as we were sure the attacks were over, and called out to the other brother who said he was ok.  I remember the strong smell of something for a short while.  With our flashlights beaming we conducted a brief search of the immediate area.  <BR><BR>This time our packs were undisturbed.  We walked to the back of our bus, and there was a large rock about 3 feet in diameter wedged between the rear bumper, and the back tire on the drivers side.  One side of the rock had a very pointed edge to it, and it was inches from the tire.  Whatever had attacked us had thrown the boulder down first before it began its attack on us.  We then noticed that the other bus that the brother was in, which was the closest to the river, had been either pushed or dragged about 5 feet towards the river.  Whatever had attacked us had been very fast and extremely strong, to have attacked so quickly, and to have moved a whole VW bus by itself.  Again I don''t remember getting much sleep that night, and the next morning we cut our trip short by packing everything up, and getting the hell out of there.<BR><BR>  Ironically the first campground that we came to was the Bigfoot RV Park not far down the main highway if that helps with the location at all. We stayed there for the night and used the showers to clean up, and we slept for 12 hours straight as I recall before leaving for home the next day. I remember not having to drive too far to where there was a statue of Bigfoot in a town called Red Bluff or something like that on the way home. <BR><BR> I am 43 years old now, and I have only told this story to a few people including my wife and three kids.  My friends and I never really talked about it when we got back from our trip only because it was so surreal, and I personally thought that people would think that I made it up, or I was insane or something.  I remember for a long time after the trip that I would still get the chills if I was home alone, and I would think about the attacks.  To this day I really don''t have any idea what it was up there.  I have thought about everything that it could have been including that crazy looking guy we met on our way to the campground but it would have been impossible for him to match the strength and quickness that I witnessed those two nights.  I don''t believe in supernatural forces, monsters, aliens, and creatures that have never been discovered. <BR><BR> I consider myself an intelligent man, and a reasonable person.  I see enough in the real world as a peace officer to believe in fairytales.  I am only writing about my adventure because I saw the article on bigfoot on AOL, and decided to check out the web site.  I thought it would be fun to share my incident with you.  To this day I am not saying that we were attacked by a bigfoot, because we never saw anything to support that claim.  I am only saying what I am saying, and that we were attacked twice by some unknown man or animal, with enormous quickness, stealth and strength. <BR><BR>The next year my friend went back to the same campground with his brother and another friend, and no further incidences occurred. I am open to any reasonable explanation, but I don''t lose any sleep over this after all these years.  I just thought this would interest you.     <BR>", :environment "Huge mountains, dense forest, rugged landscape, and a river about 40 ft. across, about 15 miles from the nearest highway.", :fixed_year "1977", :run_time "2022-05-20 16:15:56.000000"} {:nearestroad "Olive Springs Rd.", :date nil, :locationdetails "This is near the epicenter of the ''89 Earthquake.

Shortly after I continued back to Jones Valley resort and tried to put it out of my head.

I slowly crept ahead and began to stop as this bear was shuffling down this embankment on two feet, but it was not a bear. I stopped completely and not over one hundred feet in front of me was this thing intent on getting across the road the road in front of me.<BR><BR>If I didn''t see it on the bank I probably would''ve hit it, because it was that close.

I mean from the centerline on its right leg it jumped clear off the pavement and over a two foot embankment and was out of sight. <BR><BR>It was not overly tall probably just six feet or a little taller, but extremely was thick maybe in the 300 pound range this thing was built. It was hair not fur and matted and dark brown but with a rusty auburn tint to it. I was extremely close with high beams on, and stopped in the road. It had long arms like a gorilla or something, and it sort of lumbered forward like a gorilla only fast with definite long strides; it had something it was aiming for and when it looked at me it turned its head back straight and this thing jumped off the road like an elk on one leg. It had extremely thick legs and shoulders, and no man could make a jump like that. If I had a video camera in the dash of my car you would have seen the video of your life. I couldn''t make out any genitalia it was so hairy I would estimate its body hair like six inches long and matted and dangly, but not so much on its butt or the back of its legs. I could make out the thighs and they were some guns. <BR><BR>I was too scared to get out of my car to look over the embankment, that and my daughter was freaked out. Get the heck out of here.

My son and I took a short vacation to my childhood memories trip area to French Gulch where I remembered an eerie thing that happened back in the mid 60''s with my father. I had lived with my grandparents in an small town called Summit City just a few miles below Shasta Lake Dam when my father one day took me to French Gulch way way back deep into the woods North and North East of the French Gulch town. <BR><BR>I remember always feeling as though being watched and sometimes herd really eerie sounds. I remember the eerie sound that made this worse for me to be comfortable. I was a naturalist though and always felt drawn to the deep woods and so it was hard to keep me from it. In latter years after retiring from the U.S. Army I took a trip visiting relatives in Redding, and one evening I packed up the truck for an deep adventure back to those woods and was their mostly to get those big pine cone''s with delicious pine nuts. <BR><BR>We left late that evening, getting their as it turned near dark and I felt my memories would help me find the places I had been as an teen with my dad and park and get some sleep and then wake up at some old cabin. It was as if I could practically reach out to the stars that clear bright night and (as well the moon was out partially) some of the ledges on those high peaks were a bit scary driving by them as it was so dark and far down I couldnt see how far. Then after about three hours of this turn and that and many miles I had forgot to count, and my son fell asleep; I became tired and stopped. <BR><BR>I turned off the truck engine and left the headlights on as I saw so many pine cones about an foot or longer and I began to load a few up. I had a camper shell on the little Plymouth arrow Pickup and could lock ourselves in for the night when time came. <BR><BR>Before I stopped, I just happened to turn the truck around on the road as it made it easier to load some of the pine cones and as I got out beginning to loading more pine cones, that is when I heard that noise and it was very close. I was petrified at the sound as it is nothing like the elk calls that sound a bit eerie too. I began to slowly pick up a few more pine cones as these were only for decorating for our Christmas seasons and as in my childhood days, I would get the green ones that made it from last autumn and were still on the pine trees as I was still the tree climber. I had reached down to pick up the fifth pine cone and it was then I just froze up and full of panicky fear. I could hear up the side of the ledge, ridge, to my right clearly a heavy pounding of what sounded like something very large. Only two distant sounds pounding the ground and the damn thing was coming fast. I dropped the pine cones at once and ran up to the drivers side fumbling in fear with the door trying to get in the truck. Then I started the truck up and was trying to put it into 1st gear and jammed it in just as I let out the clutch awaking my 7 year old son. I had heard the sound coming down behind the right rear of the truck just before I got the truck started. I happened to look back in the darkness behind the truck as it darted forward and in the dimness of the tail lights I seen this awful dark hairy figure standing upright behind the truck. The moon and the stars were out which helped me see this figure form as well. I had been stricken with such fear that I had never known before at this moment and nearly drove off the side of the road when my son said, Dad, watch out !!. I then nearly flipped the truck over, just missing a small log. I had no gun with me.  I would have not feared what this was, and would have shot in the air as a warning or at it if I had to. <BR><BR>It was that darn eerie sound and the sound of the thing coming down the steep hillside, and at that second the issue of absolute fear of not having any defense, that got my spirit stirred. I knew for sure it wasnt a bear, as that memory is still just as plain to see today. It took a while before my son got me to say what happened on the way back as I was barrowing down the mountain as fast as I could, and am surprised I didnt forget each turn I had to make on the roads I chose going out on the way back. <BR><BR>We just pulled into French Gulch when daylight was breaking and I had to stop and sleep for an hour or so when my son woke me up whining about being hungry.  I woke up a bit dazed and it came back to me what had happened and I started up the truck and headed back for Redding.  My son was teasing me, Oh dad it was probably just a bear.<BR><BR>We reached Uncle Bills place on the right side of the road well before Redding where he lived on some property of his brothers wifes Father; an Italian whom passed away. Still to this day my son teases me at his age 23. <BR><BR>I was a ranch care taker a few years back in Flagstaff, Arizona, and I had seen a lot of things and heard a lot of things, but nothing that could ever compare to what I experienced on that early morning above French Gulch, and I surely didnt want to.  I always carried a gun with me on that ranch just the south side of Rodgers Dry Lake even in the surrounding woods.<BR><BR>Their were signs posted before entering that forest North of French Gulch stating to keep out during the evening (Night) and cut firewood only during daylight hours.  I hadnt been their for so many years and wanted to experience what I remembered as an teen, but I sure wouldnt have if I had known what I would have encountered that night.<BR><BR>Im very serious, because I''ve studied the Sasquatch or Bigfoot ever since, and would go with someone else today and be a lot more prepared for such an venture, but never again alone like that night and without some serious protection. I have never herd of where this big beast has come up on some one like me and acting like it did, but it sure did with me.<BR><BR>I hope someone does get some physical evidence because I havent enjoyed being teased all these years; also we could put an end to the mystery of this beast. I''ve known what it was like to have big bears visit at night up in the high country of the Colorado Mountains, Rabbit Ear Mountain-Pass area, where I camped with wife and our first born.  Ive been around the world and seen a lot of things from the mountains in West Germany and in South Korea in the Ming Dung Mountains where the Siberian tiger still remained back in 1975.

I am quit sure we were there for two weeks that year and as I remember it, my sighting occurred about a week in to being there ... since I spent several days after that looking for traces of what I had seen.<BR><BR>I slept closest to the door and somewhere during the middle of the night I heard a little stirring outside. Everyone else was asleep and I didn''t wake anyone since I had already been informed (emphatically) that no one else wanted to see a bear. I very quietly and carefully crawled to the door of the tent and cautiously stuck my head out the door. I looked over to where the food bag was hanging and saw something that was unquestionably NOT a bear. What I saw was two dark hairy creatures just standing there under the food bag like they were negotiating how to get it down or something. One of them was a good foot taller than the other. My Dad would have come to the bottom of chest of the biggest one. They were just huge! The smaller one was probably just a head taller than my dad. I had that as a gauge after all since I had seen my Dad standing there in the very same spot under the bag, and he hung the food bag in the same place every night. They were VERY tall and very upright.<BR><BR>I had never heard of a Bigfoot at that time, but I knew these were not bears. Bears are pear shaped and standing upright isn''t a position of comfort for them. For that matter, they don''t just ''stand'' next to each other like they are carrying on a conversation. The incident took place very quickly. It was fast, but I was VERY impressed and it was clear to me immediately that I was seeing something extraordinary.<BR><BR>What happened was that as I saw them, and saw that they were something unexpected, I did one of those surprised intakes of breath ... a true ''gasp'' I guess you could say. They heard that and both turned and looked at me. Then, they turned and looked at each other, looked back at me again, and then ... they were just gone. They made not a sound. One moment they were there, and then they were not. I did not go out of the tent. I did think about it, but ... I laid awake all that night thinking about it. I had absolutely no idea what I had seen.<BR><BR>The next morning the first thing I did was go out in the direction I saw them leave to see if I could find tracks, but the earth was very hard and dry there. I didn''t see anything. It might be that someone more skilled than I was at the time might have found some trace, but I didn''t. I did spend a goodly amount of the remainder of that vacation watching and walking in the woods. I recall I even passed on water skiing a few times to go search the woods.<BR><BR>I didn''t tell anyone what I saw until a few years later. I told NO ONE at the time. I was the youngest in my family and already endured a considerable amount of teasing on a regular basis ... you know, kid stuff. I was not about to tell anyone I saw a 7 foot (or so) tall hairy man creature in the campsite. It would not have gone well.<BR><BR>Oh, what I saw of them ... Hairy, with long hanging brown to black hair. I didn''t catch any gender features. I just assumed the smaller one was female, but I have no reason to think that since I was mostly just seeing their height ... and the fact that they looked at me ... they LOOKED at me. Uh ... there just aren''t words. I did catch that the arms were quite long and they were very big in the chest, shoulders and upper arms, not so much in the hips.  Nope these were not bears at all. I do not recall if there was any strong scent associated with my sighting. <BR><BR>I didn''t know what I saw until a year or so later when I saw a picture of the famous movie footage. I was so excited to see something that looked like what I had seen.<BR>I am 49 now ... I will never forget. <BR><BR><BR>", :environment "It was pine forest at the edge of the lake.

In hindsight I remember how odd it was for it to be that quiet on a Saturday night on Lake Shasta. Not even insects were making any noise.I had been sitting in front of a small, almost-out fire for some time when I heard a large tree branch break about 50 yards away. It was sort of an instant ''pop'' sound and the branch never hit the ground. Initially it startled me but after about 10 minutes I had just written it off as one of the normal noises that the woods make at night. Then I heard another branch break in the same fashion maybe 10-15 yards from where the first had been broken, again never hitting the ground.

Then came a sort of rainy cloudy day in March of 2001, I think, when I was on the mountain by myself. At Lake Shasta Caverns we had tours leaving 3 times a day and it was the last one that day. From way up on top of the mountain you couldn''t see much beyond you and I''d say the visiblity was 300 yards or less. My tour arrived and turned out to only be two people, a male and female. The bus driver turned the bus around and returned to the bottom of the hill. As the three of us were standing there we were looking out across the ravine talking quietly when we heard some rustling and distinct thumps on the ground. They asked me what it was and I just kept watching thearea it was comming from. As we were looking up and down the ravine 200yrds away, a never before noticed, but clearly viewable, skid path was spotted by the man on my tour. He had a high pwered scope type camera and zoomed in. All the while we were still waiting to see what was moving down the ravine at such a high speed and moving the tops of what I thought to be pretty large trees on this path.

They sounded similar to sounds I have heard on bigfoot recordings, and very much like nothing I had ever heard before, very loud, and very erie. I hadn''t ever heard certain animals scream before, so I honestly don''t have a base of comparison. We never left, we just sat there sort of freaked, because it WAS a subdivision (albeit at the end of a street) and because we didn''t know what it was. I figured maybe a fox, because I had seen the fox in the area in the days preceeding, and day of the even, strangely, I never saw the fox after that night). I am skeptical about what it was that made the noise, I don''t think it was the fox, although, I haven''t heard them yelp. I haven''t heard owls before, but never have seen them in the area. It did scare me, and I haven''t forgotten it, even though it was about 8 years ago.  An interesting side note, there was a dead kitten in my gutter in the morning, near where I sat, And another kitten limping nearby, I hadn''t seen the kittens around prior to the day either.

Lucky, my partner, thought it might be a bear, so we didn''t pay it much mind.<BR><BR>I guess about 10 or fifteen minutes passed, when all of a sudden we heard dry brush breaking up on the side of the mountain. From where the camp is located we were on the east side of the mountain. From that point the mountain goes straight up. Lots of brush and timber. Suddenly, whatever it was started screaming and we could hear it crashing through the brush. It scared the hell out of us.<BR><BR>Then it must have turned and headed uphill. It was still screaming but it sounded like it was getting further away. We were both too shook-up to move, so we just sat there not saying a word. I guess about 20 minutes passed without hearing anything, then all of a sudden we heard a log come flying down the mountain crashing through the brush.<BR><BR>Then it started again: this time the screaming was louder and seemed to be closer. The wind was coming from the north, which was where the spring was. All of a sudden it smelled like something had died. It smelled like a strong urine odor. The smell was overwhelming; it was like somebody had opened an outhouse door or something. And the screaming was louder than ever.<BR><BR>Then all of a sudden it went quiet. We stayed up another hour or so before we decided to turn in for the night. We put some more wood on the fire and got in the tent and got ready to sleep. Then it started again. It lasted about ten minutes then went quiet, but then it really got scary. The light from the fire was pretty bright and showed through the tent. We were both hugging our deer rifles, wondering what would happen next.<BR><BR>All of a sudden we both saw a shadow come between the fire and the tent. It moved slowly and was very large. Then as quickly as it started it ended.<BR><BR>The next morning we searched the area for foot prints but were unable to find any. What we did realize was that our pickup was parked right near the spring and there was a very large log that had not been there the day before. We figured maybe whatever it was didn''t like the pickup so near to the only water in the area. It was a very dry year and all the natural springs in the area were dry, so this was the only water for miles.<BR><BR>I have hunted this area for the last 25 years and I have back-packed in the back country all my life.

Myself and a frind were fourwheeling on light, snow covered roads at about two am. we came around a corner and we both saw something run across the road.  it had very long, shagy red hair and it was running on all fours.  something like a gorilla would when charging.  we only observed it cross the road when we apperently spooked it.  we are both outdoorsman and have seen bears and the like befor.  when it happened, we both simultaneously looked at each other said \"what the hell was that?\" and then said \"we better not tell anyone or they''ll think were crazy!\"  I can''t swear to what it was, but I''ll swear it wasn''t a bear.  this thing was the wrong color to be any kind of cat and it was to thin through the torso as compared to its overall size to be a bear and i suspect bears would have already been in hybernation.  the hair looked like it could have been 18 inches long, very shagy.  its body shape was like a giant human, not a cat or bear.  unfortunately the animal never

above lake huntington. in the sierras. myself, my fishing pardner, and another gentleman, were all fishing a small part of the river there, it was the last weekend of the season, before they close the roads, due to snow. about 3 miles down the river, my pardner decided he had enough, and stop to nap. this other gentleman and myself pushed on, maybe 3/4 of mile from where we had left my friend. i stop to fish a pool. the other guy  dropped down to the next pool, to fish it, that is how we were working the differant areas. 1 guy would stop to fish a hole and the other would go right down below. as i was fishing my little stretch, i noticed the guy coming back up, he looked very excited and was waving for me to come there, i figured that he landed a good fish, or had seen a bear. he was almost in a frenzy, he just told me to hurry when i caught up to him he was looking over the edge of the next little drop off, i looked over and saw nothing unusual, he said it was right there, and jumped his way down to the spot, i followed, asking him what he had seen. before i could even get the words out of my mouth this smell, i cant explain to you what it was, wet, moldy, well animal, musk filled the air, nothing i have smelled ever was like this. my friend then told me that he had seen it, again before i could even ask above us i saw it, there standing no more then i would say 25 yards up the hill, was a the creature i believe to be a bigfoot. about 8 foot tall, covered in a reddish brown, and some what black hair, the face i remember it looking almost humanoid in appearance. it then turned and began taking huge strides up the mountain, not running, but covering some serious ground.on 2 feet. not 4. i tried to follow it, but again i felt an almost hynotic sensation over take me, and my pardner later told me he felt the same way, and  i couldnt move, we watched it go right up to the top and over it. i felt very over whelmed, and did not say anything to my friend, we just walk in a silence back to our other friend, he could tell we were shooken up. but never let him in on what had just occured. to this day, when ever i think about it, i get overwelmed with emotion. when i got home i called the gentleman and talked to him about what we had seen, the feelings we went through were basically the same, when he saw the creature he said he could smell the smell i described, but not nearly as bad as when we came down to where it had been standing. then a strange feeling over took him as well, almost like we were hypnotized, or drugged. he has trouble now remembering what he looked liked, he can remember seeing it and the smell, but all other memeories are fading. i can tell you , i will never forget what he looked like, and have came to my own conclusions, i believe the smell the bigfoot emits can be used as sort of a defense system, let me explain, i believe when excited or scared the aroma he emits can actually work on a persons system, maybe for one, it makes you feel drugged, or for another it makes you feel hypnotized or just plain scared. the reason i feel this way, is like i said to this day, when i think about it, i am over

Actually in Fresno. The area is mostly farm land and some sparse woods and vineyards. nothing like foresty though. My self, my cousin and a friend had decided to go late night fishing at a little area on the river where the river sort of pools. Their is a bridge there. It was late and we were sitting there and fishing when we heard something making noise and looked back and saw a coyote running across the bridge heading north. The coyote kept looking back as it ran as if it was frightened.The coyote looked at us but it was clearly focused on something behind it and it was scared. We thought at that time that that was odd. We then heard what we thought was a splash as if someone had dove into the water behind us. It was dark so we just glanced back but of course saw nothing. We probably sat for about 10 minutes or so when suddenly there was a huge goosh and splash about 25 yards away in front of us. We stopped fishing and then tried looking into the darkness.This small boulder throwing continued at least 2 more times before we actually saw a dark figure about 40 yards away standing what looked about waist high in the river. Their was a full moon so it wasn''t to dark to see that it was a pretty big creature. By this time we were starting to get scared and were pretty much froze in place and had began to yell at it, thinking that it could be a person. This prompted my friend to yell threats of violence as young people are sometime prone to do, this creature basically turned it''s whole body to the right of it and grapped another boulder and with both hands over its head it threw it at us, this one landed about 15 yards away. It made no sound or noise only threw small boulders. It threw about 2 more boulders the last landing about 5 yards from us enough to splash water on our faces. By this time we had reeled in our lines and were trying to get out of there as fast as we could. We ran all the way back to the car which was through some trees across a field and up a hill. We went back the next day to the area and on rafts floated to the area where the creature had stood. My friend is about 6 foot tall and jumped in the water to see about how deep it was. The water came to his shoulders. Their was no way this was a man. We even saw some of the boulders that had been thrown at the bottom of the water as it wasn''t more then 5 1/2 feet deep.

I was backpacking with two other people in California''s Sierra Nevada mountains, near the northern boundary of Kings Canyon National Park. About a year later I wrote down a very detailed description of the event. I have always wanted to report this to some appropriate organization, so now that I have found the BFRO site, here it is.<BR><BR>I was 16 at the time of the event. I am now 37. The following is a refined version of a description I wrote one year after the event.<BR><BR>I was on a backpacking trip with two family friends who were about my parent''s age. Our destination was the Devil''s Punchbowl in California''s Sierra Nevada mountains which is about a 19-mile hike on good trails from the parking lot at Courtright Reservoir. [You can find a topo map of the area at http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?z=11&n=4112372&e=335727&s=50&size=m] The first night we camped at a place called Long Meadow. The second day was a long hike to Fleming Lake (elevation about 9600 feet,) where we made camp just before sunset. Our camp was at the northeast corner of the lake, about 50 yards from the shore, up against a low, steep granite slope. We were the only people camped at that lake that evening. The two adults set about making dinner, and I went fishing at the lake since the fish were jumping vigorously. I started at the point on the lakeshore that was closest to the campsite and worked my way around the north edge of the lake towards the west. It was starting to get dark, the wind was virtually calm, and it was so quiet and peaceful that I could clearly hear occasional sounds from camp about 100 yards away: talking and the clinking of cookware. I was really focused on the fishing since I was very eager to catch something before it got too dark.<BR><BR>I was changing a lure when I heard the sound. It was a distant wailing coming from the north/northeast, up a broad open valley, to my left. Fleming Creek runs through this valley. This call is very hard to describe, but one could describe it as human- or primate-like in its smooth, round character. The call was broken up into segments that rose and fell in pitch. Each segment lasted about 1.5 seconds and each followed immediately after the one before it, like \"oooOOo, oooOOo, oooOOo\" with the pitch and volume rising in the middle of each segment and trailing off abruptly at the end. There were about six segments in the call, making the total call length about 10 seconds. The sound was somewhere between an \"oooo\" and a \"wow\" sound.<BR><BR>I froze immediately upon hearing this. It did not really scare me, but it commanded all of my attention. I heard it very clearly though it was faint and obviously far away. I would guess its origin could have been anywhere from one to two miles away, up the valley to the north/northeast. As I said it was very calm that evening and sound carries far in conditions like that. The call stopped after the first six \"oooOOo\" segments, and I immediately and very consciously decided that I was hearing things and ignored it and went back to working on my lure. Then I heard it again and there was no ignoring it. There was a total of five or six very clear, distinct calls made up of about five or six \"oooOOo\" segments each. The entire event lasted maybe 45 seconds or a minute.<BR><BR>Once the second call started I stopped what I was doing and listened very carefully as the call repeated. I was definitely not hearing things. It was not the wind, since the breeze was barely a whisper. I was in an open meadow with a lake immediately in front of me and a tree-covered granite mountain behind me. The sound was not echoing, as there was nothing for it to echo against, and the sound did not trail off as it repeated as an echo does. It started and stopped very deliberately.<BR><BR>This spooked me and I packed up all my fishing gear and went back to camp. I told the others that I had heard an animal call of some kind and asked them if they had heard anything but they had not. My guess is that the sound was masked by the noises from their own activities and the steep but low granite slope behind them. I forced myself not to think about it much, since we still had four nights to spend out there and we were headed deeper into the mountains. I did not hear, see, feel, or smell anything unusual for the rest of the trip, though I was pretty keyed up and attentive after that.<BR><BR>Regarding the quality of the sound:<BR><BR>About a month after I got back from the trip I read in John Green''s book \"On the Track of the Sasquatch\" the description of the Puyallup recordings from 1973. It describes very well the quality of the call I heard: The unidentified noise is not an \"eeeee\" scream, but more of a long \"whooOooOooOoo\" or \"whoopwhoopwhoop\" at a high pitch and with immense volume. Heard from a distance it can be compared with the sound of a siren far off but it definitely is not that. When I first read that I got chills all over and I felt a little shocked, since that is an extremely good way to describe what I heard.<BR><BR>I recently found your website and listened to all the supposed Sasquatch sound recordings, and the sound I heard could easily have been made by the same source. But the sounds on your website are mostly long wails or howls, and what I heard undulated up and down fairly rapidly. The voice itself sounded like a cross between the 1973 Puyallup sounds and the 1993 Del Norte County \"angry Bigfoot\" scream. But what I heard did not sound in the least threatening. In retrospect, it seemed as if the caller were simply announcing to everyone that it was present. Though there were multiple calls, they all seemed to come from the same source, from the same direction. I did not hear anything that sounded like an answer.<BR><BR>To my mind there is no way this could have been a person unless they were playing with an amplifier. The noise was obviously far away and I find it hard to believe anyone (short of an opera singer) could project a call like that over such a distance. There were not that many people out there anyway. Since then I have heard coyotes, owls, horses, donkeys, grouse, and other animals in the wild, and they don''t sound anything at all like what I heard. I have never to my knowledge heard a cougar, so I guess that is a possibility. I have heard that there could have been elk in that area, but I have listened to several elk bugles on the Web, and none of them are remotely like what I heard. Those elk recordings sound like someone trying to make a sound on a saxophone for the first time (dry and squawking), and what I heard had a very smooth \"primate\" quality.<BR>", :environment "High Sierra conifer forest, near the treeline.

I didn''t sleep well that night.  I had a feeling I was being watched and was uneasy. Breaking camp the next morning, Van went for water coming from an artesian spring in the wall of the canyon.  He found one very clear bigfoot footprint in the wet sand below the spring, about 80 feet from where we''d camped.  He called to me to come over and see.  My first reaction was this was a hoax.  Van and I examined the footprint in detail.  It was about 17 inches in length, with 5 clear toes and pressed down about 2 1/2 inches in the sand.  There was a musty smell in the area but this wasn''t overpowering.  Van concluded the print was real based upon the fact it had rained hard the previous morning and you could see the pattern of the rain drops on the surface of the sand except where the footprint was.  Also whatever had the print may very well be slightly above us at the end of the bluff in some rock outcroppings.  He suggested we get out of there while the getting was good.

I was dreaming I was trying to sleep but there was noise outside so in my dream I got out of bed and went to my window and pulled back the curtain.  I started tapping on the window to let whoever was outside know they were being noisy and disrupting my effort to try to sleep.   After my third tap on the window, I woke up from my dream and realized I had to go to the bathroom.  I got up and made my way to the toilet.  My bedroom window was open and my bathroom window was open.  Just before I flushed, I heard a faint noise, and I started to think it was a motorcycle coming around the bend on the highway, and in that second I thought to myself Who would be riding a motorcycle this early in the morning?. Then, the noise got louder and drawn out, and had a deep vibrating howl, and then it stopped.  I realized then that it was something I have never heard before and it was not human.  It sounded like it was on one of the mountains behind my house.  <BR><BR>Afterwards, I noticed there were no dogs barking, not even my dogs, and there werent even any crickets.  It was dead silence outside.  I was telling myself, oh my god, did I just hear what I think I heard?  I headed back to bed and noticed the clock said 3:33am. I asked my husband if he was awake. He had been snoring when I was in the bathroom.  I told him I had just heard something.  I explained the sound to him and I said I think it was a Bigfoot.  I could not believe what I had heard.  I could not sleep for over an hour, and we laid in bed waiting for more howling but there was none.  <BR><BR>The next day when I told everyone in the house, nobody had heard it.  Later Sunday morning, I used my cell phone to google different animal sounds to try to find the same howl I heard.  I tried Mountain lion, Wolf, Fisher, Fox, and none of them are in the least bit similar.  Then, I googled Bigfoot howls.  Oh my god! The 1994 Ohio Moaning Howl is almost exactly what I heard.  I got chills when I listened to it.  I played the recording to my household, and my oldest adult son recognized the sound also.  He as well as a few of his friends have had a few experiences too, including a rock being thrown at him. He has the rock in his bedroom.  I phoned my other family members and told them what I experienced and my mom told me that there was a post on facebook about a week earlier from someone that lives a few blocks away from me.  She was returning home late at night near the local dump (between Hoopa and Willow Creek, California).  Apparently, she thought she saw something near the highway and so did the car behind her as the other car turned around and drove back.   This location is only a couple of mountains away from where my home is located.  I figure the Bigfoot traveled to Hoopa from the dump site.   <BR><BR>I have lived in this area (Weitchpec and Hoopa, CA) almost my entire life and I have never, ever heard such a howl.

The one to the left would whoop once, but the one behind would whoop three times and the others once or twice. At the start of the whoops would be almost a pucker or click sound.

I was stationed at Beale AFB, Ca., and I would always drive around looking for the next great fishing hole.  I had been driving for quite some time and had decided to pull into Humboldt Redwood State Park.  Being from Alabama, I figured seeing these big redwoods would be kind of cool. <BR><BR> So, I got off of Hwy 101 and took the Avenue of the Giants exit.  Driving down the road I was amazed at the size of the trees, so they kind of grabbed my attention. I started seeing a lot of places where I was thinking I could fish, so I started to slow down even more to find a place to park.

As far as the neck goes it didnt really have one.  The animals traps made it look like it didnt have a neck.  Kind of like me.  <BR><BR>But after I did find a place to turn around, I went back to look around, dumb I know, to say the least.  I only found a couple of tracks. They had to have been 14 to 15 inches long, plus the stride of this thing was a lot longer then mine. Just to make the stride this thing did, I had to make one heck of an effort.

All I had with me at the time was a fishing rod and a GPS receiver so I wouldnt get lost. <BR><BR> I parked the truck and started out on foot. I had talked to two local fishermen about what was in these rivers, and what to use. Im from the south and this area was like a new world.  So I made my way down to the river along the side of the bank.  At times the going got a little hard but I managed.  I tried several places but the water was moving too fast, so I thought that I would try and find a slack part of the river, where the flow was a little slower.  Now these woods are a lot different than the ones I was used to, so I was a little excited about this new area.<BR><BR> I had been walking for maybe 45 minutes and covered maybe two miles when I saw something in the distance.  At first I thought that it was just a stump, seeing that I had left my glasses in the truck.  Now my vision isnt that bad, but I still need them for driving.  But, I started feeling a little uneasy due to an earlier encounter, plus it might have been a bear. <BR><BR>But, being the idiot that I am, I had to get closer.  I got to within about 75 yards, because I was using the tree line as cover. That was as close as I wanted to get.  You could say that my heart was beating out of my chest it was like I had buck fever.  Well now that I was within good sight of the creature. It was easy to see what it was.  It finally stood up, and I didnt know up until that point how big it really was.  <BR><BR>Now, I had a roommate who was 6''7 and this creature would have easily stood over him.  At the best guess I would have to say that it was 7''6 tall, and it had to weigh over 400lbs.  It finally turned to me and made me out in a second, but when it turned, it didnt run away instantly.  It just stood there.  I guess it was trying to see what I was. We must have looked at each other for 10 seconds or so, but it felt like 10 minutes. And in that time all I could see was that the creature had dark reddish brown hair, and the arms easily hung down to the creatures knees. <BR><BR>But within an instant something spooked it. The creature turned and looked down river, and it just took off.  Now the ground that this thing covered was amazing.  I didnt move for a good bit, because I was in shock.

The first night we stayed at Onion Lake on Onion Mountain located on forest service road 13NO1. We spent all afternoon setting up camp, takeing pictures and looking around Onion Lake for Sasquatch evidence. Around 9 p.m, just as it got dark, we heard a loud grunt roar down from a hill top just above our camp. The grunt we heard can only be described as something exhaling a great amount of air all at onece. The grunt was very loud, very rough and only lasted for a second. My brother turned to me and said,\"WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT\"? At that moment a deer ran down the hill from the direction of the grunt and into our camp. Then out of the darkness, another grunt roared through the forest from our right at a distance we thought was about 100-150 yards out from our camp. Then we heared a grunt that strait out from our camp that was at least 400-500 yards out. Then we heared the grunt from up on top of the hill again. Then the grunt to our right answered the grunt on top of the hill and then we heared the grunt that was out 400-500 yards answer the grunt on top of the hill and the grunt to our right. It was as if what ever it was makeing these sounds were communicating back and forth to one another. This grunting was very intense for the fist hour or so then it calmed down a little through out the rest of the night. The last grunt we heared was around 5 a.m just before first light. At one time around 10 p.m, we heared a loud grunt come from behind us over by Onion Lake. I turned on my three miliion candle spot light and searched the forest in the direction we heared the grunt but saw nothing. That grunt could not of been no more than 100 yards away from us and was very loud and rough. Around that same time the other grunts seemed to getting closer to our camp as well and we were starting to get scared. We huddled together in the middle of our camp with our rifles and shotguns in hand along with our three million candle spot light in hand ready to take on what ever it was makeing these loud grunts. We were hearing something we had never heard before in the woods and what ever it was, it sounded like it was VERY BIG by the sound of the grunts these things were makeing. We were scared. If it was not for the firearms we took with us we would of thrown all of our camping gear into our vehicle and we would''ve left a dust cloud a half mile high and twenty miles long as we were getting the heck out of there. We got up the next morning and looked around a little but we did''nt see or hear anything. What ever it was makeing these grunts, they were nocturnal animals and they were only active at night. We could also tell the animals were moveing around in the forest from grunt to grunt. Example: the grunts would get loud and would come from a specific location in the woods and then the next grunt would come from the same general location but a little to the right or left and a little closer or further away than tha grunt before. But we never did hear anything walking through the dry under brush. What ever they were makeing these grunts, they move through the woods very quietly with no sound at all except for their grunts. We packed our camping equipment into our vehicle and we spent the next night down at Louse Camp on Bluff Creek. That night we had no visitors and we returned home to Eureka the next morning. About one month after we returned from our expedition to Onion Lake and Bluff Creek, I was watching a show on the Discovery Channel about Ball Pythons in India. A large fifteen foot snake was crawling on the ground in the jungle as a family of monkeys were going crazy at the sight of the snake. These monkeys looked alot like Chimpanzees but the had black faces and black fur. At one moment, a large male monkey made a loud grunt as he threw a stick at the snake. The grunt was very loud, very rough and only lasted for a second. I came flying off the coutch and said to myself,\"thats what we heared at Onion Lake\". The grunt the monkey made at the snake on the Discovery Channel was the same tone, roughness, length and sounded exactly like the grunt we heared the night of July 5, 2004 at Onion Lake. The Sasquatch is thought to be a large primate of somekind and my brother and I heared loud grunts comeing out the forest at Onion Lake. These grunts I later heared a monkey make on T.V in India. The monkeys grunts were identical to the grunts we heared at Onion Lake. I''m not a scientist or expert on grunts, but I think this is very interesting. My brother and I were raised here in Humboldt County, California and have lived here in the heart of Bigfoot country all our lives. We have been interested in the Sasquatch/Bigfoot for as long as we can remember and we plan on makeing other Bigfoot expeditions in the future because the sounds we heared comeing out of the woods at Onion Lake on the night of July 5, 2004 makes us wonder even more now about whats really out there.", :environment "Mountain Ridge with large Douglas Fir Trees.

We stopped at the Aikens Creek campground (West of Orleans, CA and just west of Bluff Creek on HWY 96) at approximately 6:00pm, as it was too late to hike in anywhere that evening and the Six Rivers NF website listed it as one of the campgrounds open through November. As we neared the pay station a sign deferred us to render payment directly to the campground host, and as we approached the host''s site it became clear that the site was vacant with just a few small items left behind. So, we took the liberty to drive in and explore the portion of the campground that was open. Driving near the Southern edge (nearest to the Klamath river) we smelled a pervasive \"skunky\" odor, but thought nothing of it at the time.<BR><BR>Eventually we pulled into a campsite (second or third from the entrance at the foot of a large hill). Our intent was to get out of the pickup (leaving the dog inside), get on our rain gear and set up the tent as quickly as possible, as it was already quite dark and raining. Just after donning my rain gear, however, I heard some distinct \"hoots\" from within the woodline which were decidedly not owl-like nor quite human-like, but could be most accurately likened to those of an ape. I asked my friend if he had heard that, but he had not, as he had two hoods pulled up over his head. I quickly scanned the woodline with my head lamp, seeing nothing out of the ordinary through the dark and rain. We began setting-up the tent when I heard it again. \"There.\" I said, \"Did you hear it that time?\"<BR><BR>\"No.\" he responded, but he did pull his hoods down. Shortly thereafter we both heard another set of \"hoots\".<BR><BR>\"What do you think that is?\" he asked.<BR><BR>I have had a casual interest in the Sasquatch phenomenon since childhood and find its existence to be scientifically plausible. I am also quite comfortable in the wilderness, having spent much of my life in the outdoors from Alaska to Costa Rica professionally, academically and recreationally, but I never honestly expected to experience anything first-hand with such a creature. So, being educated and reasonable, I declined to respond.<BR><BR>As we continued, we began hearing other noises. First we heard \"whacking\" sounds of wood against wood (more probably stick against tree). Perceiving this \"hooting\" and \"whacking\" as a less-than-friendly display, we became a little nervous and contemplated leaving; but curiousity and the dread of packing up, moving to an unplanned location and reconstructing in the dark, while already soaked; compelled us to stay. So, we continued constructing the tent between periodic scans of the area.<BR><BR>The \"whacking\" continued and we noticed it would come from different locations in short sequence (too short for one individual to move from point A to point B). Again my friend asked: \"What do you think that is?\"<BR><BR>I gave the guarded response: \"I''ll tell you what, I''ve spent alot of time in the woods and observed alot  of animals, but I''ve never heard anything like this.\" I assume he read through the evasion to the meaning of my response, given the ubiquitous usage of the word \"Bigfoot\" , and images thereof, in the surrounding communities and some casual conversation we had had on the subject during our drive.<BR><BR>Shortly before turning in for the evening, I heard a short series of what sounded like heavy footsteps on the rocky terrain of the hillside, in the rhythm of a two-legged walk. Turn in we did, however, with senses piqued and dog tucked securely within the tent. We slept intermittently and restlessly hearing sounds throughout the night.  Most frequently we heard the \"whacking\"; most regularly a rather hollow-sounding report originating from a point some distance to our Northeast and up the hill. We would, however, periodically hear closer and clearer \"whacks\" from varying locacations to our general Southeast; once hearing a disturbingly close and firm \"whack\" from our South/Southwest. <BR><BR>I awoke, once, at approximately 3:00am and heard distinct, single-note \"whistles\" from the general direction of the distant, hollow \"whacking\" which were, again, decidedly unbirdlike, yet not quite human. Soon thereafter we were all startled upright by a \"crack\" followed by loud rockslide, terminating distressingly close to our location. My friend informed me he had heard two other, smaller slides earlier that night. After all was quiet for some time (except the perpetual \"whacking\") we eventually slumbered down again, awakening to sunlight and (finally) quiet surroundings.<BR><BR>In the daylight we observed that the hillside was quite steep, rocky and slightly parabolic in shape, and the rock slide ended up in our South adjacent campsite, leading us to conclude that: 1. Inspection of the hillside would be dangerous and turn up little or nothing in the way of footprints; 2. Sounds could have originated from well up the hill and carried down the \"amphitheater\" hillside; 3. If it were people playing a prank, they must be extremely dedicated to risk their lives negotiating that hill in the dark and rain and to wait in the woods any given night for the off-chance campers might come by in November; 4. Though rock slides may naturally occur there on occasion, they certainly must not occur on the order of three a night or someone would implement measures to ensure no one camp in that location; 5. Maybe that \"skunky\" smell we had encountered just previously was not a skunk.<BR><BR>At any rate we drove on the next morning to the Willow Creek Ranger''s Office (making no mention of the events) to inquire as to open trails. We were instructed that much of the back country road system (and corresponding trails) was closed due to the Port-Orford Cedar Root disease, but that we could drive into the Horse Linto Creek area and hike along the closed roads. We took that advice and spent the next five nights uneventfully.<BR><BR>We decided to return to Aikens Creek for the final night (Saturday, Nevember 22)  to take advantage of the open, flat space to dry wet equipment and see if we could observe anything further. We picked an open site midway between the foot of the hill and the highway, layed out equipment for drying, then decided to day-hike somewhere nearby. We drove up Bluff Creek Road to its closure at the road junction to Fish Lake then hiked 1.6 miles down that road.  I payed close attention to the steep clay roadsides, and once noticed what could have been a partial footprint of a large, humanlike foot from the heel (about 4\" in width) to a point about 6\" forward (and perceivably midway along the length of the foot. I found, however, no other footprints or enough context to draw any real conclusion about the impression.<BR><BR>That night, back at the campground, we kept a large campfire and kept some down and dead cedar boughs nearby to throw in for quick brightness if needed. At one point , my dog suddenly barked and charged towards the trees at the edge of the campground just  below the freeway. I halted him and went to investigate, but found nothing unusual. Though better prepared we neither saw nor heard anything further that night. We returned home however with a new awareness.", :environment "Mountainous, steep, rocky terrain.

We were driving up the coast planning on a beach walk when I decided to go to a area on redwood creek where my friend had heard some unusual and scary whistles and screams. He is a very experienced hunter and outdoorsman with a degree in wildlife biology and he had never heard anything like it. <BR><BR>Anyway, we were walking up the north bank, where the trails are, when I decided to cross to the south bank to check out some sandbars. I loaded up my girlfriend on my back and waded across. We then continued upstream a shortways when we came across three distinct footprints. <BR><BR>They were approximately 14 1/2 inches long. I measured them with a stick that I saved. I compared them with my own barefoot track for depth and they were nearly twice as deep. I weigh about 280 lbs. I was surprised that they weren''t wider, they were almost narrow for their length. I at first thought they were human because of this.  The best print had 5 very distinct toes and was flat, no arch at all, with toes straighter across than a normal human.

I only got a short way off, when I went down on my knees and covered my face and eyes with both hands and tried to hide. At that moment I heard an animal on two legs come down the trail, a few yards from me, it stop and it had to gaze right at me for awhile, then it continued on down the hill.  I didn''t look until after it left and continued on down the mountain out of sight. So, I never saw this animal.

There was no odor or smell, and the only odd thing was that the trail became fainter, as I continued to climb on up this mountain.

This area we were in had a sighting last year around the month of July.   <BR><BR>The place where we decided to set up was a recent clear-cut that ran along the hillside.   It was about 1000 feet wide and 1200 feet long.   On the edges were fir and oak trees that developed  a thick cover.   Running the width and centered in the clear-cut was a dirt road that the local people and loggers used on a daily basis.   It also provided us with a place to park and set up our sound equipment.   it also became base for our team.   <BR><BR>From our base, looking down into the valley about two miles we could see the town of Johnson.   From or point we were about 1500 feet above the river and town.   <BR><BR>Just prior to dusk, I had two members climb to the top of the clear-cut (about 150 feet in elevation and about 300 feet away from base).   I did this so if anything was to come closer to our base camp, they would have the best field of vision, and with their night vision device would be able to determine what it was.   We also had two way potable radios for the upper lookout and base.<BR><BR>Manny and myself continued to set up the equipment and waited until nightfall. <BR><BR>Because I was scheduled to participate at 10:00 PM in a live broadcast with Jeff Rense &#8220;Sightings&#8221; program, I was insuring that my bag cell phone was working properly.   All the equipment checked out other than the phone worked but had some static in the line.<BR><BR>At 9:40 we started to broadcast.   The sound traveled very well, and seemed to echo forever.   The location we were at easily helped the sound to travel well over five miles from valley to ridge top, and saddle, it covered a large area.   Very happy with the sound, we continued to broadcast a few more times before the Sightings show started.<BR><BR>It was almost 10:00 PM when the phone rang, it was the Sightings show.   The show went fine for the first few minutes, but the static was getting horrendous, cutting Jeff Rense off completely at times.   About ten minutes into this show, Jeff asked me to try and find another location where the reception might be a little better.   A commercial was playing at the time so I quickly contacted the upper team and Manny and told then that I had to move.   I started my vehicle and drove about 600 feet towards the tree line.  I reconnected to the show and was relived that it was a better connection.   <BR><BR>I was in this new location less than 15 feet to the tree line, with visibility not over 5 feet into the trees.   I was parked for a few minutes and heard what I thought was a bear charging me (I am in a convertible) with the window down, not much protection in anyone&#8217;s mind.     I looked for my revolver and it was gone, I must have forgot it with Manny when I was in a hurry to get into a better location!   I sat there for a second, and again I heard this charging, that sounded like a few feet away from me.   This time I started my car got on the radio and told the upper team that I was moving out because of something charging me in the bush.   (Manny didn&#8217;t have a radio, as we were together at base camp and had to share two, one for base and one for the upper team).<BR><BR>I asked the upper team &#8220;do you see anything&#8221; and they replayed no.   I decided to wait it out, as this thing could expose itself to me (although I just realized that my camera was also with Manny).<BR><BR>The show continued on and I would hear footfalls, breaking branches and at least one grunt growl.   I kept asking the upper team if they could see anything and they kept saying no.    I at least had a flashlight, but didn&#8217;t want to use it in fear that I would scare off whatever it was. <BR><BR>Obviously I was becoming very concerned for my safety, not knowing what it was.   But I remained there on a chance I might be able to see a Bigfoot or at least see something.   I heard the charging again and again and finally a crackle in the radio  &#8220;John it&#8217;s looking right at you, can&#8217;t you see it, it&#8217;s about 25 feet away, that ****** is huge&#8221;.   My heart started pounding FAST, and trying to carry on with this live program without sounding distracted was even harder.   <BR><BR>The other upper team member confirmed what they were looking at, it was something that was at least 8 feet tall with shoulders that were 4 feet across.   As I sat in my car, cell phone to one ear, and the other to the forest, I could hear it charge again, and that&#8217;s when they would say, &#8220;it went back into the trees&#8221;, this happened several times.  This sighting went on for several minutes, with the Squatch looking at me by moving its body from side to side trying to get a better look through the trees and brush.   It was also observed moving its arms in a quick motion as if signaling to others.<BR><BR>This whole incident from the first charge heard to the last tree branch breaking, lasted about 30 minutes.   It was by far the one of the most intense moments in my life.<BR><BR>That next day we did search the area and found the soil disturbed where this Squatch was spotted.  Due to the soil condition, it did not allow any prints to be left.   Judging from a tree and stump in the area, it was determined that it was at least eight feet tall but closer to nine feet.   From the Squatches point of view, it had several windows to look at me, and by moving its body from side to side it would have a clear view of my entire vehicle and me.<BR><BR><BR>You can listen to this event by going to sightings.com and clicking on archived shows.

We broadcast the alleged Sasquatch \"screams\" and \"howls\" throughout the next few days, including the Bluff Creek Road areas.<BR><BR>Note: Before leaving the truck at the locked Forest Service gate, the Fish Lake Road, and hiking to Fish Lake, we broadcast two calls of each sound, the \"scream\" and the \"howl\". Coincidentally, our encounter occurred that same evening.<BR><BR>At approximately 9:30 p.m., we were in the process of setting up our second tent (there were six of us in the party), and maintaining the campfire when from directly across the road and meadow we heard a type of \"whistle\" or double \"whoop\" (try whistling these syllables \"WEEOOOU, WEEOOOU\") and it was immediately followed by a very intense \"screech\", which I could only compare to a bear cub in danger combined with the intensity of a hawk shriek. One of our younger members (15) insists it sounded like a possessed woman! <BR><BR>Now, I grew up in the mountains of Montana, am familiar with many animals and their sounds, and have never heard anything like this in my life. And until this moment, I have wondered what it was like to have the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. I have never felt this kind of reaction, I repeat -- NEVER. <BR><BR>The sound sequence repeated itself again, followed by a third lone screech. Immediately, we panned the forest/tree line with our flashlights with the intent of at least seeing the reflection of an animal''s eyes. NOTHING. We must have lighted the area for nearly ten minutes following the sound and still saw nothing. As time wore on, we began to relax and go about our business of finishing the tent set-up and dinner. <BR><BR>Then at about 12:30 a.m. (just past midnight, with two of the teenagers already asleep), we again heard the \"whistle - whoop\" immediately followed by the \"screech\", but this time directly BEHIND our camp site up the slope near the picnic areas amongst the trees. Again, we panned the area with lights (I broke out the 2,000,000 candlepower gangbuster spotlight and lit the night ) and still, NOTHING. No movement, no eyes, nothing. After panning around the entire area once again, I noticed movement on the road towards the restrooms and we quickly moved the light in that direction. Walking across the road was a tiny little grey fox, or kit fox. Well, for our needs, that was our mystery animal. (We THOUGHT). We figured it yelped and then made that raucous screech for some other reason. Funny, but that was enough confirmation for us and we went to bed for the night.<BR><BR>At approximately 5:30 a.m., three of us woke at the same time and after a minute or two of silence we again heard the \"whistle - whoop\" followed immediately by the intense \"screech\" and this followed again by a lone \"screech\". But, this time the sound was only about 20 feet from our tent as if it was standing directly on the paved road next to our camp site. We were all unnerved somewhat, but agreed it''s just that darn kit fox again, and didn''t bother to jump out with the video cameras or spotlights. I exchanged words with a person in the other tent (not sure if this \"chased\" it away), but we then heard the same \"whistle\" and \"screech\" again, but far off in the distance as if it were a quarter-mile away. This was the end of our encounter.<BR><BR>The following morning we checked the area for any signs of tracks and found nothing. We also nearly walked the entire circumference of the lake shore searching for signs of any kind and [got] nothing. Please note that we did not HEAR any movement in the brush or any footsteps. We did not SEE any movement or eyes of any kind and we did not SMELL anything at all. After hiking out of Fish Lake the next day, and driving back to the coast, we just didn''t feel right with our \"kit fox\" explanation. It just didn''t sit right with us. The sound was just too intense. Then, upon discussing the incident with John Freitas that same evening, he agreed with the idea that foxes almost NEVER even make sounds, much less something as nerve-wracking as that of the night before. <BR><BR>On our trip back south, we stopped for a break and found a poster-type map discussing the numerous Bigfoot sightings and locations and in the accompanying paragraph it stated that \"... sounds associated with bigfoot encounters include whistles and shrieks similar to that of a mountain lion.\" We welcome your feedback on discussing these sounds.", :environment "Lake shore Forest Service campground (our site approximately 150 yards from shore), paved roads throughout, surrounded by thickly-wooded Northern California pine forests.

But, I wanted to catch another steele before the river blew out so, I drove down to the river bar as described in the \"Where did it occur?\" section of this report.  <BR><BR>I parked about 30 yards away from the rivers edge, on a dirt road surrounded by dense willows.  I turned off the car and opened the door.  Immediatly I heard two bellows that seemed far off.  I initially thought it was local kids.  The best I can do to discribe the noise is to ask you to try and make it--- put your lips togeather as if to make the sound of a \"B\" then bellow \"Whoooooooop\", wait two seconds and do it again. This is what I heard.  <BR><BR>To this day I can physically emulate the soud. The sound was similar to the bugle of a bull elk.  I used to work as a horse patrol park ranger on the eastern slope of the Rockies in Rocky Mountain National Park, I kept visitors away from the elk.  In addition, I have frequently heard elk bugle near Oric, CA. I know the bugle of an elk.  That''s not what this was.  <BR><BR>Well, I didn''t think much of it so I got my wadders on and proceeded to the rivers edge.  I wadded in up to my thigh and began fishing moving slowly down stream.  The river was probably about fifty yards wide and nearly at bank full about ten minutes went by and I noticed a dark figure down stream an accross the river, seemingly standing behind a large root wad.  I could see what I though was a head and shoulders of a bear or something? It was drizzeling and I couldn''t focus on it at first, I wasn''t sure it was an animal I thought it might just be part of the root wad.  <BR><BR>As I fished down stream I worked my way dirrectly accross from it and looked at it again, I looked right into its eyes, they were dark, it didn''t move. I then saw another to its left, I could see its body from <BR>the thigh up, it didn''t move, it was looking slightly down stream and I couldn''t see its eyes.  <BR><BR>These things looked taller than a man, had flat faces and large round eyes, their shoulders were broad and their arms were long, they were mostly covered in hair although the one on the left seemed to have bald spots on its chest area, like mange.  They stood still, never once moved.  Ikept fising and tried to work down stream of them to a tailout wher I could cross and sneek up on them to get a closer look, the river was to high.  <BR><BR>As I worked back upstream I noticed a cacoon shaped object perched on the root wad overhanging the rivers edge.  It was shaped like a foot ball but was probably 4 feet long and 21/2 feet in diameter (hard to tell at 50 yards).  This cacoon like thing appeared to be neetly wrapped in dry grasses like cat tail or pampas grass blades.  I kept fishing moving upstream of them back toward my car, at one point I looked back to get another look anfd the cacoon like thing and the animals were gone.  A day later I drove to the other side of the river to go see if I could track um but the river had flooded the entire area.  <BR><BR>I don''t follow Big Foot stuff, but I do know no bones have ever been found.  As a scintist this encounter has stimulated me to develope a theory.. I theorize that they warn eachother with this BWhooooop sound, and that the reason we have never found their bones is that they cleverly dispose of them by waiting till the rivers are on the rise, packaging the bones, and putting them in the rivers close to their mouths so that they wash out to sea.  I''m not sure I belive in any of this but thats what I saw and heard and thats my theory.  My second theory is that it was an elaborate hoax preformed by somm sort of Big Foot fan club or somthing.

We left them outside anyway and crawled into our bags to sleep.<BR><BR>Then the dogs began whimpering and trying to claw their way into the tent.

It sounded like a really loud frat party in the middle of nowhere on a stormy blustery night in the dark. It sounded like the people were talking very loud yet howling at the same time.

This seems to be a common phrase in these situations but I have to say that this feeling of being watched is something I never felt before or after.

This smell was so strong that it seemed that it had to be right in front of your face. We figured it was coming from a particular stand of trees and decided to walk up and behind this stand to see if we could still smell it.<BR><BR>When we got behind the stand we couldn''t smell it but when we got back around down-wind of the stand we heard something take off downhill and down-wind of us. All we saw was swaying brush where it had gone crashing down the mountain side. Some of the guys wanted to chase it but I convinced them that since it had left that we should leave it alone if it left us alone. Well ... in 15 minutes the smell was back. This time everybody in camp grabbed a gun ... we had a lot of guns and decided to chase this smelly thing down. Except for me and 2 others. I just had a flashlight. Well ... they chased this thing out of the aforementioned stand of trees and could hear it and smell it but could not see it. We could hear it stomping and thrashing around behind the stand of trees. They chased it up a narrow trail that led to a spring.<BR><BR>I was bringing up the rear but only had the flashlight so I went back to camp with the other 2 that had remained.

They came running out of the forest single file screaming in fear. They said the could hear and smell what they were chasing but could not see it and then suddenly there was no sound or smell. At this point they decided that whatever it was had stepped off of the trail and they had run right by it.

Perhaps it was not close enough to a sighting to publish on your site. I originally said that the incident occurred at Mcgee Creek. I was incorrect. It was Deadman''s Creek. It was Summer.

We headed out cross-country staying as close to the creek as possible looking for good fishing holes. We had walked about five miles up the creek towards the mountains when we both got the feeling that we were being watched. We both looked at each other and called each other light-weights and kept on going.<BR><BR>We fished for awhile, by now it was late afternoon. We noticed that there were none of the usual sounds that you hear in a forest such as birds, etc. We still had that feeling of being watched. The sky was starting to look threatening as an afternoon storm was heading down the canyon / creek towards us.<BR><BR>We started back to camp when the storm caught us and lightning started. A bolt of lightning struck the ground on the other side of the creek and up a ways from our location. Directly afterwards, we heard a growling or grunting sound from the area of the strike. We heard the sound of branches breaking in the brush. The sound was moving up the creek away from us and up the mountain. The breaking branches sounded as if they were high up in the trees. The trees in the area are conifers and the dead branches started about six or more feet up the trees from ground level -- so whatever was breaking the branches, it had to be pretty tall.<BR><BR>The object was moving fast because it was soon out of hearing distance. You know as well as I that sound travels a long way in the woods and we were in a canyon so the object was really moving. We never noticed a foul odor or saw anything conclusive. I did, however, see a large shadow moving through the woods briefly.<BR><BR>Please understand that although we were very young we had a lot of experience in the back country.

My father and I would fly fish for steelhead in the riffles during mornings and evenings and we would spend the hot hours of the day canoeing, exploring, resting, etc. These trips would often take one to two weeks to complete.  During one of these trips (probably in 1969 or 1970, I was about 8-9 years old I think...) we made camp on the river bar at the mouth of Tek-Tah creek.  There was a good flat bar there, and at that time of year, the creek was flowing under the sand and apeared dry. One afternoon, while everyone else was napping, my father and I took a walk up the creek bed to see if the creek was flowing on the surface somewhere inland.  About two hundred yards upsteream, the creek did come to the surface and flowed sluggishly thruogh a series of large pools. I remember my dad telling me that these pools were probably full of baby salmon and steelhead waitng for fall rains to allow them to swim down to the main river and out to sea.  My dad had a very scientific mind and he would describe natural processes in great detail when we had the patience to listen.<BR><BR>As we proceeded inland up the creek, we rounded a bend and entered a long, sandy bar on the east side of a long arching pool in the creek. As I looked across the surface of this bar, I saw a set of tracks in the soft sand. These tracks caught my attention because they were very large, and the space between them seemed very long, like if I laid down next to them, they would almost be further apart than the legth of my body.  The tracks also seemed to sink alot deeper into the sand than the footprints of my dad, who is pretty big (6'',2\"). The tracks began at the water''s edge at the lower end of the bar, and proceeded diagonally across the bar in a straight line to the far end of the bar.  <BR><BR>My father had never told me any stories about bigfoot  (he would deny the existence of any animal that was \"unknown\" until science recognized it anyhow) and to my knowledge, I had not heard of any such animal at that time, nor had I any thing more than a passing interest in these types of things then, but these tracks...thier size, gait, and the way they led across the bar in a strieght line...they made a funny impression on me.  My father was also very interested in the tracks, he asked me please not to walk near or in them, then asked me to sit down while he spent several minutes comparing his foot size to them, and trying to match thier spacing by walking next to them.  He seemed very tense, as if he sensed something, or was trying to figure something out.  Eventually, I got bored of sitting and got up and followed him. When I finally caught up with him, we were half-way up the bar.  He had stopped looking at the tracks and was instead looking intently at the timber ahead and at the southern edge of the bar.  He was very quiet and tense.  I have never seen my father frightened or worried about anything before, or since for that matter, but watching him the way he scanned the surrounding forest so intently, made me very nervous and excited.  I broke the silence and began to ask him what he thought made the tracks and what was he trying to see in the trees...He turned around, almost jumping a little in suprise, and told me to be quiet.  then he looked around some more, and started back towards the camp with a qick pace, grabbing me by the hand, and saying these are the tracks of a big bear, son, and we should leave this area alone from now on.  Then he told me not to come up the creek alone, and not to tell Mama or my brother or any of the others anything about what we saw, that it might worry them or something, and that he would speak no more of this matter.  Just like that!  <BR><BR>Well the older I get the funnier that incident and those tracks seem to me. I have hunted for many years and have seen and tracked many animals in the woods since that time, and have never seen anything like that since.  I am thirty eight now, and my father has retired. I asked my father about this incident last year, and he was silent and pensive for a long time, then he told me that he does''nt remember this time or seeing anything other than bear tracks. I don''t know what we really saw that day, but I do know that it scared my dad, and he has never ever spoken to me the way he did on that day, or behaved that way since.

Sometime during the night I was awakened by a huffing sound.  I woke one of the other boys up and we listened to something slowly working its way all around the outside of the cabin.  We woke up the three others and all listened.  Whatever it was outside was poking at the old rotted boards around the bottom of the shack.  We could hear it shuffle around and pry at some of the boards.  Finally it moved around to the front door, which was only about five feet high and Butch got my old .22 rifle and said, \"Open the door!\"  I did not want to open the door but did anyway.  Whatever it was, was standing right in front of the opening but because it was dark, all we could see were hairy legs.  Butch fired the .22 and this thing screamed and spun around and took off.

I was far ahead of my friends and decided to scare them as they came up the trail so I climbed up some rock cliffs for a better advantage and settled down within some Huckleberry bushes to wait for my friends.  After things quieted down I noticed a heavy smell and started looking around.  The breeze was blowing straight from the brush behind me and I felt the hair on my neck starting to rise up. My two friend were nowhere in sight.  I noticed a small movement in the berry bushes right behind me.  I stood up ready to run when this thing stood up also.  It didn''t hesitate but turned and walked off into the brush.  I heard trees snapping and the crunch of dry leaves echo away as I ran back to my friends who were still two hundred yards away.  After I calmed down we went back to the spot to look for some sign.  They believed I saw a bear but I know what I saw.  We found where something was squatted down and stripping berries.

My friend and I were bear hunting up in Humboldt County on the Hoopa Indian Reservation. It was in March or April. Back then bear hunting was open all year long in Humboldt County, and there were no limits. We were from Southern California, and were totally unfamiliar with the area. We stopped in a town on the Trinity river, I believe the name of the town may have been Willow Creek, I''m not sure. Anyway we met some Indians in town, and asked them, if they knew of any good places to hunt bear. They said they didn''t, but added, that there was an old man in the grocery store who may be able to help us. The Indians pointed to an old blue 1950 Buick parked in front of the store, and told us that the car belonged to the old man, so we waited there until he came out. When he came back to his car, we introduced ourselves, and asked him if he knew of any good places to hunt bear. He told us it was pretty good up on the Hoopa Reservation, and gave us some general directions. We ended up on an old deserted dirt road high in the mountains in my friends dads 1949 (4) door Chevy. We kept going up until we hit snow, started to fishtail, and the right rear wheel went over the side. We set the hand brake and got out of the car to evaluate the situation. We decided to get the bumper jack out of the trunk, and jack the car up, and then push it off of the jack back on the road. The plan worked and all 4 wheels were back on the road. We backed down the road until we came to a place where we could turn around. By now it was dusk, and we decided we had better pitch our tent before it got too dark. At the turn around spot next to the road we saw a big pine tree and decided to set up camp under the tree. By the time we pitched the (4) man umbrella tent it was dark. We put all of our sleeping gear and firearms in the tent and lied down, and were talking for about ten minutes, when we heard the first grunt outside the tent. We both pretended that we didn''t hear anything and kept talking. Then it did it again, and this time we both stopped, and I asked my friend if he heard that. He said he did, and also heard it the first time. I said yeah, me too. Now, we both shut up and listened. We could hear it circling the tent, because the ground was covered with bark, and we could hear the bark crunching under its feet. We could also hear its very loud breathing. By the sound of its footsteps and its breathing, we figured whatever this was, it was huge and it was walking on (2) feet. It circled the tent several times, and we decided that one of us should go out and see what it was. Niether of us wanted to go out, because we were scared, so we decided to flip a coin to see which one of us would go. My friend lost. I then suggested that before he went out, it may be wise, to fire the 44 mag out of the tent flap first. He concurred, and stuck the barrel out of the flap and fired 5 shots. We then both went out, he had the 44, and I held the light. We looked all over and didn''t see a thing. We went back in the tent, laid down, and were  trying to figure out what had just been outside of the tent. We had never heard of sasquatch. We had been talking for about 5 or 10 minutes when we heard a very loud high pitched scream, that lasted for about 5 seconds, and sounded like it was about 50 to 100 yards away. We looked at each other and asked, what the heck was that? That was one heck of a scream. We talked a little longer and then went to sleep. The rest of the night was un-eventful. We arose the next morning and went outside, and looked around the circumference of the tent for footprints. We couldn''t see any, because the ground was covered, with many years accumulation of bark from the huge pine tree we were camped under. We had wondered many times, what it was, that had been outside our tent that night and often talked about it. Then one day several years later, I happened to be in the barber shop, getting a haircut. I picked up an Argosy magazine, and it had the now famous controversial picture of the female sasquatch on the cover. I read the article, and in the article there was a map with an X on it. The X indicated where the picture was supposedly taken. The X on the map wasn''t far from where we were camped that night. That''s when I made the connection and since then after reading about many encounters I am pretty well convinced that the animal that we had heard outside of our tent 41 years ago was a sasquatch.", :environment "It was in the mountains just along side a dirt road that was on a ridge.

About 15 minutes up the road we heard a noise in the woods on the other side of the road, we huddled together and waited to see who was there. We saw a creature on the other side, in the trees.  We began to run back down the road and the creature kept pace with us although we knew due to the size it could easely go faster. it stayed in the brush and trees and when it would get ahead of us, it would stop and watch us but never came across the road just followed and watched from across the road.

We arrived late Sunday and we set up camp. The following morning we started fishing with no luck, and the mosquitos were eating us alive, so I decide to go back down to the local McDonalds. That afternoon we did alright by catch a few decent size trout.   Mistakenly, I clean the fish at our campsite. I put them away in an ice chest as proof we did have some luck.<BR>We went to bed proud of our catch and tired from the sun and the lack of oxygen due to the high altitude [9350 feet]. Needless to say we all fell asleep fast. <BR><BR>I dont know if the dead silence, or if the heavy footsteps woke me up. But I knew someone or something stopped just outside our tent. My nephew asked what is it. I quickly hushed him. I stood up and was able to peek outside to see if it was a bear.<BR><BR>Id like to mention before I continue that Ive had run in bears and mountain lions.

We had hiked for a few days when we came to the sixth lake, and we could see the seventh lake just beyond it. Seventh lake was covered with ice and there was snow all around just past where we decided to camp for the night. <BR><BR>We thought this would be a good place to stay and explore the next day. During the night a snow storm hit and it became freezing cold, so my father and I put our sleeping bags over us and huddled together for warmth. I kept looking at my father''s watch and hitting the light on it to see when we could expect the sun to rise so we could get warm. It was 3:45 a.m when we heard footsteps walking up the trail towards us. Our tent was right on the edge of the trail, and whatever was out there walking was on two feet and very big, we could almost feel the ground shake as it got closer. My father and I looked at eachother in silence, both of us a bit shocked by what we were hearing. It walked right up to our tent and stood there for about five minutes, completely silent.<BR><BR>I have very good senses and I could feel that whatever it was absolutely didn''t want us there. I could feel its anger resonating, I can''t explain how, but I got the most scary feeling in my heart. It wanted us to leave. Then it walked off just as suddenly as it came, but it headed in the direction of the frozen lake, and beyond that the trail went into very rugged wilderness. I didn''t think it was a person because it had no flashlight, was very large, and only an idiot would continue walking on the trail into the wilderness at that time of night, in the middle of a snowstorm.<BR><BR>My father and I were quite frightened by our nightime visitor, and when first light hit we instantly broke camp and headed down the mountain without making breakfast, nor saying a word to eachother.

My name is J. C. and I am a 41 year old Vice President of a bank. I have been harboring an encounter I had for 31 years secretly out of fear of ridicule or shame. But now that I have seen other people have had similar situations, I must tell my story. During September 1972, I was hiking down from a lake with my dad and my friend on a fishing trip. We were at a place called Barney Lake out of Mammoth, California, and were on our way home. After a weekend of camping and fishing we were backpacking out from the lake. I was the lead person going down the trail. I had outpaced my friend J. C. and my dad by about 4 minutes without knowing it as I was moving quickly down the trail. After about 10 to 40 minutes down the trail from Barney Lake (I can''t remember exactly after all these years) I came into a clearing. It was a small flat grassy meadow from the trees which I had been seeing downhill till then. I took a break to rest from my fast strides and looked out over the meadow. The first thing I saw was a big white rock boulder near the end of the meadow. The meadow was maybe 20 yards by 30 yards of grass. At the point of the clearing to my left I heard extreme thrashing going on. I looked over to my left to see a large animal bent over with its rear end facing me. It was only about 12 feet away from me. I saw that it was hairy and had a reddish, orange, brown multicolor mix hair to it, and most different was a rear end that was bare like a monkey''s. I knew this because at this time in my life I spent most of my lunch hours in the library reading zoology and marine biology books. I thought this was very strange because no bear could bend over at the waist and have skin over its rear end like this. In my fear I was frozen, shocked and bewildered at the same time. I had never known or heard of big foot or sasquatch at this time in my life. At this point it had been maybe 5 or 6 seconds and then the animal lifted up and stood erect. It was enormous. It must have been 8 feet tall or more, and for a 10 year old boy this was unreal. It had been scratching with its hands and grubbing and digging prior to looking for what I thought was food. Its back was to me when it stood so I could see it was built similar to a human but with a lot of hair. I knew this was no bear from my background. I also knew only black bear were seen as an almost extinct species here during this time, and would have been much smaller in height and stature. I got so scared I ran full pack towards that big white rock. I literally dove over the top, pack and all, and snuggled against the rock, so scared to even look, in case the creature heard me. Finally after about 20 seconds or so, I peeked over the rock to see nothing and no one on the trail. Within 1 or 2 minutes, my dad and John came down the trail and into the opening. I started screaming at them \"look out, look out,\" in fear that the creature was still there and would do something to them. They froze,  bewildered, looked left to where I was pointing and then back to me in confusion. They were standing at the clearing at the spot I had been at. I finally came out and walked to them and looked into the trees and thick brush only to see broken brush, twigs and some hair there. We moved on finally and I never spoke of this again except to my dad and a couple of close friends. Around 7 or 8 years late I saw a couple of bigfoot movies including the Patterson video. Once I saw this, I knew without a doubt this was what I saw. I still kept my story a secret out of fear, but this vision haunts me and will all my life. I know it was so real. I will never forget this and take it to my grave. I am now someone who needs answers and must try and find out that this creature does exist or I will not put my memory to rest. I know what I saw was no figment of my imagination or hoax. I want to seek it out. Anyway, I hope this eye witness helps some where some how.", :environment "Pine forest, fairly thick,and low brush.

We were walking along an old camp road that had become overgrown with brush and scrub.  <BR><BR>It was obvious that bear had been using this trail as there was a considerable amount of bear sign along the old road.  We got to a point in the trail where there was an overhang of pine limbs over a slight depression on the right side of the old road.  Upon inspecting the depression we noticed what appeared to be a left foot print, and a right leg outstretched in the pine needle cover on the ground.  We continued to survey the area, and noticed what appeared to be more tracks leading away from this overhang and depression.  I took photos with a disposable camera.  I have the prints, but they did not come out very clear.  Which was a disappointment, but something to look at nonetheless.  <BR><BR>We finished poking around, and continued on our way.  We got just a bit further down the trail, and we walked through an extremely strong smell of skunk, or wet dog-like odor.  No sooner had you smelled it that is disappeared, but if you took a few steps back it was extremely strong again.<BR><BR>I have been hunting and recreating outdoors for many years, and I am very familiar with skunk spray, and how it seems to permeate a large area.  This was not simply the spray of a skunk.  It was very centralized.  It was literally like you walked through it, and it disappeared, then you could turn around and walk through it again.  <BR><BR>The two of us spent a few moments looking around, and we noticed, something very peculiar.  In the middle of the trail and not far from this smell, and the foot prints we had seen, was a large pile of oak acorns.  The strange thing was there was not an oak anywhere near this pile of acorns!  They seemed to have been placed in this location.  They were not a collection of shells from squirrels, they were fresh dropped acorns.  Enough to hold a hungry deer, or two for a little while.<BR><BR>We theorized that whatever had been hunkered down under the pine overhang in the depression may have placed these acorns, then set up under the overhang off of the trail in ambush.<BR><BR>Our intent was to walk to the back of Pine Mountain, then still hunt our way up to the top of the mountain.  We had used this road for years to access the back of the mountain, and we were very used to the topography, so anything out of the norm would be noticeable to us.  <BR><BR>Chris and I team hunt very well together and after a short strategy chat, decided to use a 50 step method: one of us would go 50 steps, stop and whistle to let the other hunter know it was their turn to take 50 steps, and then just watch and listen.  We were approximately 130 yards apart.<BR><BR>The ground was covered in heavy and dry leaf litter so the going was somewhat noisy.  I had gone nearly three quarters of the way to the saddle at the top, and I heard what sounded like a whistle, but not the whistle I recognized as Chris''.  I also heard what sounded like a very large boulder break loose and roll down the back of the hill.  I had assumed that Chris had rolled it down hoping to kick something out, but based on the last whistle, this rock was rolled from that area, and seemed to be 60 yards to my right, when Chris would have been twice that distance away from me.  I though that maybe he had gotten closer to me as we made our way up, but that would not have been the case in the past.  We work very well together and spacing is everyhting on our team hunts.<BR><BR>We got to the top of Pine Mountain, and we had a discusion and he told me that he thought I had rolled the boulder, and vice versa.  I told him about the whistle, and he told me the exact same thing.  He also had this overwhelming feeling of being followed up the hill.

Having been there once before four years earlier with a church youth group, and consequently having had a blast, we wanted to camp in the same campground and generally do a lot of the things we had done on our first trip, but without the constraints of adult supervision. We where both twenty years old at this time. <BR><BR>We camped at a place called Lost Creek campground, which sits just inside Lassen National Park along its northern border with Lassen National Forest. On the second day we decided to take a late afternoon hike down an old somewhat overgrown logging road just on the other side of the national park/national forest boundary fence.  We knew of this road and its destination because we had hiked it four years earlier.  This road was lined with tree stumps, and had decades of old logging debris, and it had permanent tire grooves in the dirt.  As this road heads north down the slope from our campground it runs about 3000 ft., until it ends at a fire road running east to west.  We hiked west on this road about 100 yards to where the road runs along side a small meadow to the north. We hiked across this meadow to a creek called Lost Creek, hence the name of our camping site.<BR><BR>After soaking our feet in the icy water, my friend said we should probably head back up to camp as it was getting close to 7:00pm and he didn''t want too get stuck down there while it got dark.  We crossed the meadow back to the fire road and started walking east.  We then noticed on the road about 200 yards ahead of us, what at first glance appeared to be a large naked man with a dark complexion, walking away from us.  At second glance I thought maybe he isn''t naked but he''s wearing a fur coat with a pointy hood.  I remember saying to my friend \"take a look at this guy\". A few seconds later the figure stopped in its tracks and moved to the left side of the road, the whole time with its back to us.  I got the impression that he/it had noticed something and went to investigate.  A few seconds later it continued on its way with a very swift and deliberate gate, arms swinging slightly.<BR><BR>I think what sticks in my mind the most was the bawdiness of the shoulders.  In fact, I remember this character had a well defined hourglass figure.  He/it remained on the road for what seemed like a full minute, the entire time it was walking away from us, with his back to us. The more I watched the stranger I thought the situation was.  Eventually the figure disappeared from view, either around a bend in the road or up into forest to the left, I could not determine the direction.  We didn''t say too much about what we had just seen, however we seemed to walk a little more quickly back to camp.  I know I was a little nervous.  I can''t really put a size to this figure, because of the distance at which we viewed it, but if pressed, I would have to say it was over 6''5\" tall and about 270lbs., maybe even 300lbs. <BR><BR>The rest of the evening was uneventful, but the next morning at about 5:45am we both were awaken by what sounded to us, to be a series of powerful yelps and growls coming from the general direction of the area where we were hiking the day before.  I don''t know if any other campers in the area heard this. <BR><BR>My friend and I never really discussed this event among ourselves; or anyone else for several years, until for some reason, I brought it up once.  We still can''t come to an agreement on what we saw or heard.  I''ve told my wife about the incident, but very few others. I don''t know if my friend has told anyone.

There were 4 of us hunting that day; my dad, and myself and 2 good buddies. Well, the deer hunting was not that good that day so one of my buddies said to us, my wife''s uncle is gone from his cabin and won''t be back any time soon, so why don''t we visit his land and all and just hang out and all and have some lunch. <BR><BR>Well, he lives by Lake Hughes''s road and close to where we were. We went over there and unlocked the gate as he had a key. We went in there and we had brought some apples for our lunch and all. We seen he had hogs and started feeding them these apples. After about 1/2 hour of doing this, we heard the horses behind the house or cabin, running around and making all kinds of noise. <BR><BR>We could not see what was going on as; the house was in the way. But, man were they going nuts!!!  So, we all said to each other, let''s get over there and see what''s up. We did and could not see anything but the horses still going nuts and running in circles. We then looked over this fence and threw a gate and seen these huge foot print''s and smelled something like a dog that''s been wet and rotten egg''s mixed. Well, the gate was locked and he went inside the cabin or house and got a key for the gate. <BR><BR>We went over to the prints, and I''m 6-5 at that time, and weighed 275 lbs. I have a shoe size of 15 4-E. These tracks were much bigger than my shoe and they were made, with some of them in the snow.  I stepped next to them and could not press down and going that deep! I could go maybe 3/4 - 1 inch down. These prints were 4 inches deep!! They were also, 2 to3 inches longer than my foot and much wider.<BR><BR>Then I tried to step that far with my step, and no way could I. Then we followed the tracks until they came to this really steep hill. There this thing went up this hill on 2 legs and stepped high enough that, even my good buddy who was a body builder and in great shape, could not climb. I could not even lift my leg that far, and I was 16 years old and pretty limber. No man could lift there leg that high or step that far! No man!!!  Nowhere did we see bear tracks and even if we did, they don''t walk that far on 2 legs. Whatever this was, it walked along this fence and turned and went back into the woods, and then up this very steep hill. It must have looked at the horses and maybe seen us feeding the hogs. I never seen it, but we got scared and left that ranch. <BR><BR>I have told this story to a few people, and they look at me like, it could be, but you can tell, they don''t think this is real.  But, when you see things like this, you just know something is out there. Nobody could change my mind on this one as, I know what I seen and it was not set up as, nobody knew we were going to his ranch, and the next ranch over, nobody was home there either. So, the only thing that could be is, this was real and not faked. Nowhere did we see any human foot prints by any of these tracks or up that steep hill.

My best guess is 1978 or 1979.  My father, mother, younger brother and I were camping in a State Park off of Highway 101, in Mendocino County, CA.  Our parents were in their late thirties, I was 16 or 17 and my brother was 10 or 11.  (Of course these ages are approximate and may have been a year or two less or more).  We also had our dog with us, a 60-pound Black Lab - Dalmatian mix.  It was late July to early September and very likely Labor Day or the weekend after Labor Day.  <BR><BR>The park in situated on both sides of the Eel River, and is for the most part second growth or new growth Redwood forest mixed with other trees and brush of the area.  The main section of the park is next to Highway 101. The far side of the park, away from the highway and across the river, is only open from the end of May to the middle of September.  The rest of the year the access bridge is removed and stowed above the high water line. The far side of the park has more foliage and is frequented by bear, deer, raccoon, skunks and other animals.  We were camping on the far side of the park as far up the hill as possible.<BR><BR>I believe this event occurred toward Labor Day or the weekend after Labor Day for the following reasons; we had something of a ritual in making a final &#8220;end of the Summer&#8221; trip to this park, the park was very quiet meaning other campers had made an early start home to avoid holiday traffic or were not there at all being the weekend after Labor Day, and on this particular morning my father stayed in camp to do some paper work.  He was a high school math teacher so he usually did lesson plans or other work only in the late summer.<BR><BR>Mom, my brother, the dog and I decided to take a short hike up a trail on the edge of the campground.  The trail worked its way up over the crest of the hills for about two miles and ended above a barn and farm located in a clearing at the bottom of the other side of the hills.  The trail is mainly up hill, makes several cut backs, and passes across two or three unpaved fire roads.  It was a clear sunny day and there was no one else out on the trail.  <BR><BR>Our dog liked to take the point position to see the animals ahead.  She was an avid hunter of rabbits and liked to chase deer.  I had often seen her race after deer, taking dangerous inclines and thick brush at full speed.  On this day I do not recall her scaring up anything to chase.  The three of us talked as we went up the trail.  During the last half mile to quarter mile of the trail my mother gave us a serious order to stop. We paused while she looked and listened to an area behind us to our left.  She asked if we heard any thing, but I do not recall if my brother or I did.  <BR><BR>We walked on, more slowly now, listening to the forest.  After about 50 yards we felt like we could hear something moving in the woods, behind us to our left, and once again stopped.  The noise stopped when we stopped.  This time we indicated that we did hear it.  The dog was in the middle of the trail listening as well but did not go into the brush to investigate.  We continued on now for another 50-100 yards and we were almost to the crest and the vista area.  Again we thought we heard the noise paralleling us to our left but were not 100% sure.  We all stopped again.  Before we could again acknowledge the sound, there was a loud wooden knocking noise off to our right.  It was 3-4 quick &#8220;knock - knock - knock &#8211; knock&#8221;.  Initially I thought it was two tree trunks rubbing together in the wind.  I looked up to see if I could see anything, but there was no breeze.  Before I could look back down, there was a loud forceful huffing of air coming from the bottom of the tree.  It was something like a growl but not quite.  It was low and guttural, and was a rapid exhalation of air from a very large animal.  <BR><BR>Whatever it was, that was enough for us.  It was my mother who spun around and said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s go.&#8221;  No one disagreed and we turned and sprinted all the way back to camp.  I think we covered the two miles without a stop.  Instead of taking the lead, the dog took up the rear position, which in my mom&#8217;s opinion was meant to protect us from whatever was behind us.  This was the first and only time we heard anything like that and was the only time we have ever even contemplated running in fear during a hike.  I do not recall any smell in the area. <BR><BR>The incident has never felt right to me and I have thought back to it on several occasions.  My mother has always thought that a bear was stalking us.  (She has always had a very strong apprehension of bears, and always warned us not to get between a cub and its mother, or try to feed a bear or approach any bear.  Nonetheless, we have chased them away on more than one occasion.).  I have heard of stalking behavior in bears before, but only in grizzlies, browns and polar bears &#8211; not in the California black bears.  Additionally, the behavior of the animal did not seem like a bear either, and did not elicit the response from our dog that I would have expected for a bear.  <BR><BR>I discovered this site about 12 months ago and the similarities of other&#8217;s reports with my incident made me think that this was a bigfoot.  Assuming the accuracy of other&#8217;s stories, it seems to be a more plausible explanation than being followed by a bear as well, as a better fit with the facts.  I spoke to my mother recently about it and she still felt it was a bear, besides she said, &#8220;Bigfoot are only up in the Pacific Northwest.&#8221;  I separately spoke to my father about this site and he thought I was pulling his leg.  After I told him that I believed the stories were sincere, and told him some of the common details of the events, he immediately brought up that time &#8220;you guys came running down from the trail.&#8221;<BR><BR>I did not send this sooner because it is a class B and twenty plus years old already.  I have heard a couple of stories regarding other incidents, but none that I have first or second hand knowledge of.   <BR><BR>What may be of interest is that I have seen a nest like the one in Report 2928.  I cannot recall exactly where I saw it but it was within the last 5 years.  It was some where in the Sierras, and I think it was in the Mammoth Lakes area.  I recall being off trail, cutting between lakes, or trying to relocate a trail when I saw it.  In any case it was well off the trail and quite a way from the town or trailhead.  Thinking it was a human&#8217;s hand made shelter, I was surprised at the amount of effort that must have went into building the little A frame.  It was tucked in between some tree trunks and the roof was a tight thatch of broken limbs.  It just struck me that a tent would have been easier to move and set up, and would have afforded better protection overall.  I glanced around but did not see any garbage or clothes or other signs of a camp.  There was no smell that I recall.  I was also surprised at how far away the nest was from the town &#8211; whoever this belonged to was trying to stay well away from the trail and others.  I guessed that it must belong to someone that really wanted to be left alone, so I went on my way.  <BR><BR><BR>", :environment "Redwood forest, new and second growth.

A short distance north is Weott.  I have been a country girl all my life and have spent my life close to the land.  I had always been drawn to the forest and had slept outside when ever possible.  The weekends were made for pitching camp and swiming in the Rattlesnake Creek that runs along the foot of the property.  This time I wanted to spend the night along the side of the river by the deep pool we always swam in. The river has giant boulders to lay on and bask in the sun.  Both sides of the river are steep one side one side is so steep and gravel like you cant even climb it. <BR><BR>Well after much pleading with the people I had brought, they said ok we will camp on the river.  They were drinking a bit much and I was not going to touch it because I was worried they may decide to take a swim and sink.  We had fun with a small campfire we sat and laughed until it was late.  We rolled out our sleeping bags on the bank, the river at our feet and the steep cliff to our heads.  The spot we were in had a bit of a ledge high over our heads.I dont know what time it was when I woke up but I am a light sleeper and I heard the gravel over our heads being walked on. I lay still and listened.  It is moving across the top of the ledge toward my right. There is a deer trial that comes down to creek level about 10 feet away from where I am sleeping and I hear this person coming down it.  I was scared and tried to wake the people closest to me without making to much noise.  Then I kicked the person to my left and he snores louder.  <BR><BR>To my right, this person (I say person because it was two footed by the sound of it) was no more than 10 feet from me.  It stood behind a willow bush/baby tree it was really just 5 or six canes coming out of the stream bed.  It was dark but I could feel its size when it walked and shook the canes.  I kept thinking I am going to kill these @#% guys, why are they sleeping still? <BR><BR>Then the thing started yelling at me.  I know the sound of the animals in the California woods.  I have never heard this in my life.  It was yelling at us \"What the hell are you doing hear, this is my place.\"  It wasn''t like a mountain lion grawling and saying \"I''m tough and I can kick your [butt].\"  It was broken up into batches of sounds with inflections that I recognized. It was like a person speaking another language but you know they are telling you directly to get the hell out of my house.<BR><BR>I could see glimpses of it when its body moved into the light of the river.  Its right side was as tall as the canes I knew to be 8 foot-ish.  It ranted and raved and stomped and shook the bush.  I smelled skunk and thought \"Great this is all I need, they will bury me without a funeral because I am going to stink.\" I finally got my voice and said \"Ok Ok its alright ok ok .\" I did not see or hear it leave.  But I realized at some point it had left.  My encounter lasted only a few minutes but it felt much longer.  I stayed awake the rest of the night and I was so mad in the morning at my fellow campers.

It will help explain the delay in ever having reposted this incident. The sighting occurred about three months prior to my entering the United States Army. I served for three years as a Paratrooper with a Top Secret Clearance. After my time in the service, I became a Los Angeles Police officer. I did that for thirteen years and am now a Federal Agent, working for an O.I.G. out of Washington DC. With that background, you can probably understand my reluctance to discuss this sighting with too many people. It really boils down to a potential career killer. <BR><BR>That being said the incident DID occur and I remember it vividly. Many many years after the event, I reconnected with my friend (the witness) and asked him to tell ME the story as he recalled it. I wanted to check my memory and see if his matched mine. It did. To a T! Only a few months ago, I spoke with my brother in law, a witness after the fact. I asked him if he remembered the event. He did. It should be known that he is not the kind of person that would \"buy into\" such a story, had he not been semi involved. <BR><BR>Anyway, this is what happened: My friend Craig and I were both 17 years old and waiting to leave for Army Basic Training. He was due to leave in June and I would go in August of 1980. We were staying with my Sister and Brother in Law at the time. They lived in a cabin in Green Valley California. Craig and I enjoyed our last months as civilians in that area, and used it to train for the difficult training ahead of us. We ran every day along the mountain roads and hiked the hills, trying to get into prime shape. <BR><BR>In May, we decided to test ourselves and camp out for a full seven days. We knew the perfect place for this would be what we called \"The old campground\" because of its isolated surroundings and terrain that would be perfect for climbing and hiking. So, we packed up a weeks worth of supplies and, though my sister Cindy and her husband Tom offered to drive us, we decided to act like soldiers and walk to the location. We did this with full packs. <BR><BR>My sister and Tom advised us that they would check on us at least every other day and that they would bring us food and lemonade and such. Tom also, offered to provide us with two weapons to be used for protection against any strangers that may try to harm us. After all this was before cell phones and we would be on our own big-time. There was also a heavy rattlesnake threat in that area, so we happily took him up on the offer. Tom met us at an area near the mine shafts later that day and gave us an M-1 rifle and a 12 gauge shotgun, with ammo for both.<BR><BR>The dirt trail that leads off of the main highway goes very far back into the mountains. In fact, were you to traverse it to its end, you would end up on top of what is known as Grass Mountain. Craig and I decided to get about three miles in and away from the highway, which was about a mile past what once was an old 1920s campground, and live deep in the bush like soldiers would. We found a great spot, next to a clear running creek and set up our tent in the clearing that was there. This clearing was completely surrounded by thick woods. Then night fell.<BR><BR>As we lay in our tent talking by the light of flashlights, we both heard the very loud snap of deadfall in the woods behind the tent. We sat up, frozen and listening. We heard what sounded like a very large and heavy person, slowly walking around our site, making no effort to conceal his presence, judging from the loud sound of breaking sticks and brush. We were both scared believing that someone was out there. We exited the tent, Craig with a shotgun and me with the M-1. I started yelling very loud. \"Hey! We know you are there. We have guns and will shoot!\" <BR><BR>Again, we heard the sound of someone walking slowly but methodically around from our left to right. We shinned our lights in the direction but could not see anything but the trees and brush. We talked amongst ourselves, wondering if it could be a bear or something, but we decided that it was a person and not an animal. After much yelling and warning that we would shoot, I decided to fire a few rounds in the direction of the noise (how crazy that sounds now) and I did just that. I fired about three rounds into the trees and the sound was unbelievable. <BR><BR>The weapon blasted and the sound echoed into the night, roaring into the canyons and fading off into the night air. We stood in silence. To our utter disbelief and eventual horror whatever it was, began to move again, still left to right, in a circle around us. What we both thought and discussed later, was that NO animal would have stuck around after the horrific noise of the M-1. Most normal people would not have stuck around either! Whoever or whatever was out there not only stuck around, but appeared, from the casual sound of the slow walking, to be less than concerned about our weapons. We made a decision to vacate the area post haste! Grabbing our coats, we climbed the embankment up to the dirt road, and carrying our weapons, we ran the entire way, about three miles more or less, back to the main highway, San Francisquito Canyon Rd. We spent a very long night, curled up in a concrete drainage ditch, waiting for the sun to rise. Every hour or so, a lone truck would come by and the sound of that brought us comfort. Again, it was a long night!<BR><BR>The next day, we hiked back to the site, expecting to find our tent and all of our supplies missing. To our surprise, everything was as we had left it. Nothing was out of place. We gathered our things, and hiked back to the open area of the old campground. We decided not to sleep in the tent because it limited our vision, and instead, laid our sleeping bags out in an open area, above the creek. After a day of climbing cliffs and cooking and such, night fell again.<BR><BR>That night, just as the sun set and darkness was beginning to fall, Craig and I were walking in the direction of the main road. We were looking for rattle snakes, because we had shot one earlier on the dirt road in the same area. As we walked side by side with me on the left, both holding weapons, we saw it. Standing just on the dirt road, facing us was a Bigfoot. There can be NO DOUBT at all about what it was. We could see it very clearly. He was about eight or nine feet tall and stood with his left shoulder even with the edge of the trail. He was covered with dark hair and had long arms. We did NOT smell anything unusual, as I have since read about other sightings. <BR><BR>The strange thing about him was the absolute indifference in his expression. He did not look threatening. He did not look scared. He just stood there looking at us.almost bored. I instinctively brought my right hand up against Craig''s chest and we both stopped dead in our tracks. We never took our eyes off of the Bigfoot as we spoke. I said, \"Do you see that? Are we seeing this?\" Craig said, What do we do? What should we do?\" We both started to walk backwards as we spoke, very slowly and involuntarily. The Bigfoot just looked at us for a few moments. <BR><BR>Then, and I will NEVER forget the detail of this he just slowly and very casually turned to his left, and began to walk into the forest. When he did that, Craig and I stopped and started talking over each other. \"Do we shoot it? Should we shoot it? What do we do? Do you want to follow it?\" As we talked, we heard a sound that we both immediately recognized from the prior night, the sound of the Bigfoot slowly walking deeper into the woods, breaking deadfall, twigs and branches as he went. We never did fire a shot or follow him. We stayed up late and slept in shifts at the campground and did not hear from the Bigfoot again.<BR><BR>The next day, Tom came up with food and supplies. We ran to him and told him the details of what had happened. It was very clear by his expression that he did not believe us. We took him to the exact spot where we saw the Bigfoot and we discovered a trail of giant footprints leading from the trail into the woods. Tom smiled and told us that we did a good job making them. We were so frustrated and begged Tom to follow the tracks with us. We all followed them and they went into and across the creek. On the other side, we found a large red ant hill with a footprint right on top of it. I asked Tom, how could we have done that? He just shook his head and smiled. We followed the tracks to a point where two large hills formed a valley that sloped upwards into the mountain area. The ground turned rocky and the prints stopped. <BR><BR>That is what happened. I have lived with this memory for many years. I am now Forty Five years old and am less concerned about what people think of me in terms of this incident. It is a fact and because of it, I know for sure that Bigfoot lives or at least once lived in the area of Green Valley California. <BR>", :environment "Pine forest in the high desert area of Southern California.

I''m assuming we rested for awhile, and I remember just talking and hanging out. As we were getting up and ready to go, we heard a strange noise coming from the bushes nearby. We stopped talking and listened, and it was a very low sort of growl/snuffling sound. My first thought was that it was probably a bear, but that ultimately I had no idea what it was, and it sounded like it was growling at us. The bushes along the trail there were very high, such that we couldn''t see through them. It scared the hell out of us and so we quickly hoofed it back down the trail. I''m not sure if we ever spoke about it again, except to maybe say I wonder what it was, that was scary, etc.<BR><BR>But afterwards I actually looked through field guides trying to figure out what was making the noise.

In retrospect (although it could be my overactive imagination), it sounded a bit apelike.

My father and Sam AKA Sandy, in front of me took a forest map out and Sam became quiet as the new sightings were only 15 miles from his encounter, and in the direction the creature was traveling. The newer sightings as I recall put the creature near Pear Blossum, CA on the other side of the mountains. I remember a news report of 1000 people lined up across the desert looking for anything and they did find some hair on a barbwire fence. To this day I know of no one having reported this first encounter three days prior. <BR><BR>Another significant item is that in those days bear season and deer season overlaped or was one in the same. At first they thought this might be a deforemed bear (they had bear tags) as they witnessed this being walking on two legs just like any human and appeared to be 7 to 8 feet tall. <BR><BR>They were a few hundred yards away on the other side of the caynon, (don''t remember the name of the caynon) but their rifle scopes allowed them to see this clearly enough that viewing the face and shape they could not decide if this was an animal or a human. I remember Sandy/Sam saying it looked like a monkey man. The animal/person seemingly did not know they were there. They had bear tags and thought about shooting the creature but as I said could not make themselves do it. I recall Sam telling my father that it had to be a bear because it dropped to all fours when it climbed the steeper terrain. My father asked Sam: How did you guys climb it? The reply was the same as the deformed bear. <BR><BR>About then my brother in-law was no longer jovial regarding the sighting and preffered not to discuss the incident.

As it got light enough to see the top, we noticed someone already on the ridge wearing what seemed to be black of all things.

We watched him dig around in some brush for at least 30 minutes, pausing occasionaly for long periods to just stare in different directions. We joked that it was probably a hunter from L.A. because anyone would be crazy to wear just black during deer, and bear season. Then he began to walk down the hill right for us, now we never left the truck yet, and he would walk a little ways and the stop and look around just as if he was hunting, but with no rifle.

We are San Francisco City people, artist; not hunters. We are not used to the outdoors or accustom to the forest and nature and the shock of fresh clean air.<BR><BR>The first encounter was on Tuesday evening, 8/16/05 at 5:17pm on highway 128 in the Redwood forest. We were on a vacation, driving west on 128 and heading towards Fort Bragg, CA. Once we entered the state park, we stopped and parked to smell the fresh air. I marked the time, because I was shooting with my digital camera. We walked into the forest, on a trail, and were having a great time, enjoying our time alone. There was little traffic or noise from the road. The forest was quiet and powerful. We have lived in the center of San Francisco for 15 years, and were stunned and amazed to experience the silence and peace of the Redwoods. As we got deeper into the woods, about 20 minutes, I started to get uneasy; feeling like someone was watching us. The digital photos my wife took of me show my concern, the longer we stayed. Then we heard it.  It was a growl-grunting. Just above the hearing of my ears. I would described it as infra-sound- a deep sound that was low in pitch, deep, almost inaudible. My body felt it more than my ears. It threw me in a panic. The fear in me rose fast. I looked at my wife and she was feeling the panic. We both looked around. We could not tell the direction. We could not see anything in the thick woods around us. It could have been a bear or a wolf. But my instincts said no. I did not know what it was. But, the \"vibe\" message was becoming clear- GO AWAY NOW! <BR><BR>Predators do not warn-they ambush-right? My wife looked at me and said Did you hear that? I said Yes. She said, Lets get back to the car. I said Good idea!  It was a weird feeling. We were stunned and mystified as we ran back to the car. We drove away nervous and excited about what happened. On our way to Fort Bragg, CA, we were talking about the experience. Was it a bigfoot? Did we have a Bigfoot encounter? We felt something special had just happened. We had to learn more about bigfoots.  <BR><BR>Over the year, I became obsessed with bigfoots. I read as mush as I could about the Sasquatch, Yeren, Almasty, and Yeti as my time permit. My wife became obsessed also. Together we decided to go back to those redwoods and try to make contact with the forest giants. <BR><BR>We made it back to highway 128 on Monday 9/4/06. Something told me to pull over at a different spot. As soon as I got out, I had the DV video camera running. On the camera my wife tells me to make my Whoop-Whoop Bigfoot call, into the redwood forest. As soon as I did, the camera records wood knocking and tree breaking. Soon the smell of a dead animal/skunk filled the air. <BR><BR>The sounds and smells go on for about three minutes,  then stops. I could tell he moved away after my calls to him, inviting him to be photographed. We left the redwood forest, excited about our contact. <BR><BR>My wife wants to see a bigfoot. I do not want to see him.  I hear that many people die or have very bad luck after seeing a Bigfoot. Remember Dr. Morbius from the movie Forbidden Planet?

It was NOT a dog howling and I''m not even sure how to describe it. We have coyotes and mountain lions and the sound would not fit the description of their cries or calls either. It had a yelling/howl quality that lasted about 5 seconds , would break off and then resume about 15 seconds later. I went in the house to get my husband so that he could hear the sound. My dog was not barking which is really unusual because he''s inclinded to bark at dogs or other unfamiliar sounds.  None of the dogs on our hillside were barking either which seemed odd to me. I was kind of scared .  My husband came out and listened. His initial response was, \"Anyway, it''s on the other side of that hill.\" I said, \"It''s not a dog, and our dog is not barking at it.\"  He agreed it was strange but wasn''t concerned. Soon thereafter, a dog could be heard barking and our dog started in with his typical barking response. The unusual sound stopped and I didn''t hear it again. This is not the first time we''ve heard  unusual sounds that we can''t identify. We woke up one night hearing whooping sounds outside the house that I can''t connect with any animal I''m familiar with. My daughter has also heard whooping sounds on the same hillside where we heard the unusual sounds last night. My teenage son heard whooping sounds last summer in the manzanita to the north of our house. We had an odd experience last summer. My college aged son and his friends were imitating \"Big Foot\" sounds that they''d heard on the internet . It was about 11:00 at night when they were fooling around , loudly imitating the sounds.  About 1:00 AM, that same night, we were watching a video and we heard a scratching at the window. We all thought my son was outside trying to scare everyone. All of a sudden , water was splashing all over the side of the house. A water sprinkler pipe outside the window had been snapped off, and water was geysering out of the pipe. My son walked out of the bathroom and it turned out he''d been in the house all along. No one had been outside and we still wonder how the pipe was snapped off. Whatever had been scratching at the window had apparently broken the pipe.  We all wondered if it was a response to the Big Foot calls that the guys had been making.

Then the footsteps stopped, but resumed a few seconds later. I repeated the growl and the same thing happened. Since I was alone and frankly a bit nervous since there was not supposed to be anyone else up in the woods with me at that time, I decided to go to dinner. I told some fellow campers about the incident during dinner and they were all a bit skeptical.<BR><BR>But after dinner we returned to the area and decided to head toward the exact spot where the footstep sounds were emanating from. I knew before seeing the footprints what I had heard since there had been stories of sightings in the area. The ground was very solid but I managed to make out several manlike footprints in the dirt, only they were much larger. My fellow campers verified what I saw. We decided to try and follow the prints, but since they were so shallow it was difficult to determine the direction the creature had taken.<BR><BR>But within a few minutes, our job was made easier because I once again heard the mysterious footstep noise. This time a fellow camper and myself decided to chase the creature making the noise so we took off running in the direction of the noise. After about a minute of running uphill, I brought us to a halt to listen. We now heard the creature running away from us very quickly. We pursued it for a few more minutes, but the only thing we found was one set of toe-prints in the area where the creature had been running from us.

I was squatting in the woods out by a little lake road of Mendocino, California. I''ve spent most of my life in the woods of California or Maine. Even had resident pet black bears that would come to the open dump at the back of the property.<BR><BR>One night, I''m laying in my tent. I don''t remember if it was late (2 am) and I woke up, or if it was earlier in the night (say 11 pm) and I was just going to sleep. Through the woods (about fifty yards away is my guess) the stomping and crashing of smaller trees started going on. It was loud. I was surprised at first and a little afraid because I was squatting illegally on state property.<BR><BR>With my familiarity of the noises of the night in the woods, I listened carefully to try to determine or identify what was making the noise. My first assessment was that it was bi-ped ... not a bear or a deer. Realizing this scared me the most.<BR><BR>Understanding the force necessary to cause the destructive sounds I was listening to scared me even further. I don''t know if profanity is allowed or acceptable, but i was more effing afraid than I could ever remember, praying that what I was listening to wouldn''t start moving towards my tent.<BR><BR>The noise sounded like a two-legged monster crashing through the woods hastily as if trying to make quick time CRASH CRASH CRASH CRASH !!! It was then I realized that I heard a dog (or two, I don''t remember) barking in pursuit. Gratefully, the noise was not coming towards me and I suspected that whatever was moving so quickly and violently through the woods was trying to elude the dog(s). <BR><BR>I think this whole event lasted about 30 seconds and then the crashing stopped. Then the next scariest thing happened. The dog barked a few more times and then it made that sound dogs make when they are brutally injured. After that, I did not hear a single damned thing except the fear white-noise inside my head.<BR><BR>You know ...<BR><BR>I worked as a split-maker for a year on LP land in Mendocino County and as a timber operator for about five years east of Fort Bragg and Mendocino.

I would turn off my chainsaw now and then and I could \"feel\" something watching me.<BR><BR>The last strange thing I would share with you about the 22 years of my life 2 - 12 miles east of Fort Bragg in the woods is the frequent discovery of disemboweled animals. Simply that ... disemboweled ... the rest of the animal intact. <BR><BR>What an eclectic mix we are in the wonderful County of Mendocino.

As the bigfoot became almost even with me across canyon, it disappeared into the manzanita, about 80 yards away.  I then heard a jeep on the above dirt road. By the time I looked back to where the bigfoot was, he already had come back out of the brush and was walking uphill. He was about 7'' tall and had a slender body like a basketball player with big strong shoulders, and a real skinny waist. The legs were really muscular, and strong.  The arms were long, as were the fingernails, and fingers. He had no clothes on whatsoever, and the bigfoot&#8217;s body was covered with about 2\" of hair with a few bald spots showing skin.  Its hair was black, and cut off about even with the upper neck. Its forehead was gunpowder gray with the temple area being purple red down the side of the face partway then dark tan.

My father was a commercial fisherman, and had his boat docked up the Albion River about 250 or 300 yards at the boat docks.  We lived in Ukiah, and came over to see my Dad to bring supplies to him and visit at least twice a week. Soon after, we put a trailer on the flats near the boat dock, and moved to the coast permanently.  The encounter happened one evening just before dark, as the sun was just going down over the hill. My parents, younger sister, and younger brother were on the boat and getting ready for bed. It was before 8 p.m.  My older sister and myself had to sleep in the car as there wasn''t enough bunks on the boat for us to sleep. We had blankets and pillows on the seat to sleep on.  The car was a 1957 two-door Pontiac Chieftain. I had the back seat and she the front. I remember it being too early and light out to want to go to sleep. We sat there and talked as teenagers will do. Across the river was a steep rolling hillside that had sheep grazing on it that belonged to a man named Paul Anderson. We had the windows down as it was summer and very nice out. We were interrupted in our talking by the sounds of sheep crying out in unison and baaing in a way that didn''t sound normal for sheep. We both jumped up and looked out the right side windows trying to see what was after the sheep. We could see the sheep running frantically towards the west side of the hillside pasture.  The sheep were scattering in different directions, separating into smaller bunches. To the left  and upper part of the field, we both spotted two very large and hairy animals chasing the sheep.  We thought that they were bears running on their hind legs like trained animals would do. It was very alarming for us to watch as these bears were terrorizing these poor sheep. Our position from the attack was about 150 yards or more. We watched as these big animals chased the sheep for what seemed like hours.  In reality, the whole chase scene was about 20 or 30 minutes. As it got dark, we were sure that the bears would swim the river and come for us next. We locked the doors and hid under the blankets for the rest of night.  It seemed like an eternity til morning came and we could finally get out of the car and go to the boat to see our parents. We told them what had happened, and I know that they thought that we had stayed up all night dreaming up that story. That morning, we were up at the post office near where the attack had occurred, and people were talking about the sheep being killed by a wild pack of dogs that were roaming around. The Sheriff, Sam Costa said that it was unusual for dogs kill and eat only the belly and insides of the sheep. We heard about the wild dogs for years after that, every time livestock were killed and mutilated by a predator.

Forest).  To get to the property, which was located many miles from civilazation, you had to travel on a very rough road (one cut with a dozer) so our motor home could not make it to our lot. Near by was a small pond and a campsite that was for the use of property owners. The pond was about 75 to 100 feet across, the banks were covered in cat tails and the pond was full of trout (we tried all day to catch some fish, without luck). My family(wife, son and 2 daughters) were aware of how quiet it was in the evening, we could not even get a station on the radio. We built a camp fire and were sitting around it watching the field mice run down to the edge of the pond to get a drink. As I remember it was a bright night, the moon was visible overhead. <BR><BR>Along about 10 or 11 pm, the wife and kids went into the camper and went to bed. I remained outside by the camp fire trying to get a station on the walkman radio. About 1am, I was putting out the fire when I saw movement on the other side of the pond, I noticed the movement because of the noise this thing was making. At first I thought it was a deer (I was told they were common in the area) so with that thought I headed toward the sound armed with my trusty flashlite. As I approached, the moonlite was very bright, I could see lots of movement in the cat tails but could not see the animal. At this point it hit me that maybe it was a mountain lion, because I could hear a low rumbling sound like a cat purring but much louder. I decided to return to the motor home, as I turned to retrace my steps (I was probably 50 feet from the noise) this huge hulk stood up in front of me and made a loud screeching noise. It raised up to a full standing position, I would say 7 or 8 ft tall, dark brownish hair.  We looked at each other for a moment and then I turned and ran full speed away from him.  When I looked back to see if he was following me, he was walking in the opposite direction toward the deep forest. I stood and watched him until he disappeared in the deep woods. He did not walk like an animal but more like a man. When I composed myself, I went back to the area I saw him at to look for tracks, but all I found was crushed cat tails, an area of about 10 ft in dia was all smashed down, and it smelled like a strong urine smell in the area. I told the family what I saw and to this day they think I saw a deer or some other animal. I tell this story now to my grand children when we go camping.

Then they started hearing knocking noises like someone hitting trees with a bat followed by a low growl ending in a high pitched scream. This went on for about 15 min. At this time I was awakened by a a noise. I wasn''t sure what it was and I thought a bear was after the deer. I jumped up and my son said something was screaming outside. I ran out with a flash light and could see nothing.  I was looking for a bear or eye shine  I got one single eyeshine about 7 or 8 ft off the ground when I panned back it was gone.

Ive been meaning to submit this experience to BFRO for a while now but I wanted to find the right timeframe noted in my journal.  I had lost this journal but I recently moved and found it in a box while unpacking.  <BR><BR>I still remember it clearly, although I have never submitted it to any site such as this before. I am an avid backpacker and have backpacked extensively in the western states, in the wildest and remotest regions, and have encountered many large wild animals including grizzly bears. Never before nor since have I had such an odd experience as this one. <BR><BR>I left one Friday evening (August 1, 1986) by myself after work with my dogs (at the time my family had a beagle and a poodle, I''ll take anything hiking with me!), and I was trying to find a lake up in Tahoe National Forest called White Rock Lake. I had never been there before so I wasn''t familiar with the unmarked roads. According to the topo map I could get there via a 4-wheel drive road. <BR><BR>Way back behind Truckee, northeast of Fordyce Lake, I found myself driving slowly, at night, on rough rocky dirt roads, trying to figure out where I was. Roads would seem to peter out, or bisect with other 4-wheel drive roads, and I had no clue where I was going. I was way out in the middle of nowhere... no lakes or significant creeks or any destination type areas within miles. <BR><BR>I decided to wait until daylight before I confused myself anymore in the darkness. I''m sure I didn''t even need to pull off the little \"road\" I was on since I hadn''t seen anyone or anything, but just in case, I did. I pulled off the rocky road just a few yards, my Datsun 4-wheel drive pickup hidden by trees. I grabbed my sleeping bag, tossed it outside in front of my truck, and me and my dogs slept under a very starry night. <BR><BR>Sometime early in the morning, around 3 or 4 a.m. (it was still pitch black), I awoke and heard something walking up the road in my direction. I could tell it was heavy, and it was walking steadily my way. At first I thought it must''ve been a backpacker, as it was obviously bipedal by the rhythm of the walk. The steps were distinct. Then I thought to myself, what would a backpacker be doing way out here on this road, in the middle of the night, with no light, with nothing but miles of thick forest in all directions? I knew it wasn''t a bear (I''ve encountered dozens of bears in my years in the wild). I had no idea what this was, but a backpacker was still my best guess. <BR><BR>As it got closer and closer, I wondered if I should say something, but I didn''t want to scare anyone unnecessarily. I''m sure it would just walk right by. But, for some reason, I was getting increasingly nervous, and there aren''t too many things in the wilderness that make me nervous. The odd thing was my dogs weren''t making a sound, or a move for that matter, which added to the suspense. My dogs would have normally at least given a warning bark or two. This heavy, bipedal thing was coming closer and closer and was about to come to the point where I had pulled my truck off the road. I laid there very quietly. I didn''t know what to expect, and hoped whatever or whoever it was would just continue on by, not even noticing me. It was so dark I couldn''t see a thing. <BR><BR>The closer it got, the bigger I realized it must be, because through the rhythm of the walk I could tell it was quite large. I stayed silent in my nervousness. A sasquatch was the last thing on my mind as I hadn''t really given much thought in the past to such a thing, especially in the Sierras. That was about to change. It came up to where I had parked my truck off the road, and... silence. It stopped. Although I couldn''t see it in the darkness, it was only a few yards away from where I was laying in my sleeping bag. <BR><BR>I don''t know if I made a sound, or one of my dogs made a sound, but something happened that made it react. This thing let out the most heinous, forest-piercing scream you could imagine. I can''t even attempt to put in words what this thing sounded like. It had a set of lungs on it like nothing I could describe or accurately imitate. Then, still screaming, it turned around and ran back down the road in the darkness at a fast rate of speed. It screamed the whole time, echoing through the forest. It never let up. I could hear the screams fading in the distance.<BR><BR>I laid there in total shock. I couldn''t believe what just happened. Eventually I jumped up and tossed everything in my truck. My dogs acted just as freaked as me. I knew whatever it was a long distance away by this point, so before leaving the area I drove down the road with my brights on, trying to see if I could see any footprints or signs of anything odd. My adrenaline was flowing big time. Although I didn''t actually get out of the truck, I opened the door and looked down to see if I could see footprints or any clue of what this thing was. The road was too rocky for footprints. I then let my dogs out, hoping they would pick up a scent (although I didn''t know what I''d do if they did), but oddly they jumped right back in the truck. This was out of character for them. I tossed them back out again, and they jumped right back in. I decided if they''re as freaked out as I am, I better get the heck out of there and I drove many miles back towards the main road. <BR><BR>I hadn''t thought much of a sasquatch before this experience, but now I''m certainly a believer. People try and explain it away to me, but I know what I heard. I didn''t see it, nor did I smell anything, but it was so close I could feel it. And it was so close when it screamed that I''m surprised I didn''t get spit on. Nothing in those forests could scream like that, nor run that fast, especially nothing that walked upright. I don''t dwell on the bigfoot subject, nor have I made it a mission to seek them out, but I know theyre out there. My experience is still very vivid. It doesn''t matter to me whether someone believes it or not. I''m not submitting this report to convince anyone otherwise. I''m just sharing an experience I had in the Sierras one night, near Truckee. <BR>", :environment "Thick forest, rough rocky road that was tough to follow at night.", :fixed_year "1986", :run_time "2022-05-20 16:15:09.000000"} {:nearestroad "HWY 158", :date "30", :locationdetails "The location of the howl was near the Double Eagle Resort and Spa located South of Lee Vining and Mono Lake off HWY 158, which is a two-lane road, which makes a C connecting back to HWY 395.", :submitted_date "2010-07-08", :sketch 0, :bfroid 27966, :otherwitnesses "The first vocalization my brother, father and I were outside on the deck of our cabin around midnight.The second vocalization my brother and father were watching TV with all of the windows open and my mother was in bed with the windows open in her room as well.", :run_id 34, :nearesttown "June Lake", :timeandconditions "Between 11:30pm-1am.", :month "0001-06-01", :county "Mono County", :state "California", :fixed_month "0001-06-01", :submitted "2010-07-08 00:00:00.000000", :title "Possible howl heard by three family members while on vacation at June Lake", :otherstories "No", :year "2010", :season "Summer", :class "Class B", :alsonoticed "I live in the Santa Clara Valley near the Santa Cruz Mountains and the Saratoga Foothills.

It was overcast and very cold with a strong wind blowing. There was still snow on the surrounding peaks. Mono Lake is at the base of the Sierra Nevada mountains. <BR><BR>I do not recall the location at which we parked the car to begin our hike, but I do remember that ours was the only car in the parking area and that the spot was quite desolate. It was a cold Saturday morning and the area was deserted. At 9:17AM I began shooting VHS video footage of our trek, and after a short period of time we finally decided to leave because of the wind and cold. We went back to our hotel in June Lake, enjoyed the rest of the weekend and went home. The trip was quite uneventful (or so we assumed).<BR><BR>The tape went into our family home video collection and for 17 years, from 1991 to 2008, it has been watched countless times by family and friends. So much so that my kids have the dialog on much of the tape collection memorized. On April 19, 2008 my daughter (6 years old in the video and now 22) was watching the tape in the downstairs family room when she suddenly screamed out and began yelling for me to come downstairs. I thought something bad had happened and after racing down the staircase, found my daughter and my ex sitting in front of the television telling me to watch a segment from the tape. What I saw when we played it back made the hair stand up on the back of my neck. And it was something none of us had ever noticed in almost 17 years of watching this tape,<BR><BR>In the final few seconds of the Mono Lake segment just before I turned the camera off I caught something very large and black moving between two rock formations a short distance from where we had been hiking. It was completely black with no differentiation in color or texture and walked upright like a human but with a gate more like a primate. At first I thought it was a bear, but after going over the video many times and finally digitizing and sharpening it I am now unsure what to think. From examination of the footage of my family whose distance from the camera was comparable to that of the creature it is easy to see the distinct details and variation in clothing, hair, face and hands. In contrast, the creature caught on tape exhibits none of those distinctions.The shape of the body does not resemble a human. The head is too large and the arms are too long. And although it does resemble a bear at one particular angle in the clip, the stance and gate don''t add up. It is an intriguing mystery.<BR><BR>That we were able to go for 17 years without noticing this event on the tape seems unbelievable, but in retrospect it actually makes some sense. The segment lasts for only a couple of seconds and the focus is on the lake and mountains which is what I must have been filming at the time. I didn''t see it when I shot the tape and it has since gone unnoticed because one must really be looking for it to see it.<BR><BR>I am not a person who is prone to believing in conspiracy theories, alien abductions and bizarre events such as a purported Bigfoot sighting. I''ve seen various footage and photographs of Bigfoot/Sasquatch sightings over the years and have always been extremely skeptical of their authenticity. As an engineer who now teaches high school physics, I am highly educated and very level headed. If I see something I don''t understand my natural reaction is to analyze it rationally using the scientific method. I do not jump to conclusions based on faulty hypotheses. So in this case, I will suspend judgment pursuant to further investigation. But having shown this video to family and friends whose opinions I trust, the overall reaction seems to be a unanimous \"Bigfoot!!\" Wishful thinking? Maybe. Maybe not. Either way it is very intriguing and definitely warrants further investigation.<BR><BR>Your opinion and assistance in this matter would be appreciated.<BR>", :environment "Away from the lake, the area is arid, a dry desert like area with sparse grass, very rocky with small bushes, and no trees.

So it was a few hours outside of Bishop, CA. We would make sure to get there early so that we could sit in the car and wait for dawn to come. <BR><BR>Just as the sun would start to rise and there was enough light to see we would normally see tons of rabbits running about, but that day was different. There was not a single rabbit in sight. That had never happened before. We stayed in the truck and waited until the sun was fully up before we decided to get out and take a stroll around to see if there was anything to see. Just before we left the truck my dad asked me if I wanted to bring the camera and I told him \"Na, we arent going to see anything out here.\" Ha-ha! Boy was I mistaken. <BR><BR>We took off from the truck and went into the wilderness. There was nothing to see at all. No animals anywhere. We were walking along and suddenly we came upon the giant footprints in the sand. There were two sets of prints, one right next to the other. They were barefoot and looked just like human feet. Right away we knew what they were. Its a natural thing that goes through your mind. When you see them you say yourself, \"Those are bigfoot tracks.\" <BR><BR>The first sets of tracks were HUGE, and thee times as big as my fathers feet, and he is about 6'' 3\" with a good sized foot. (He is very thin though). The second set of footprints was the same size as mine. Right next to its parents tracks. The tracks dug deep into the ground and my father and I talked about that. We tried to stomp on the ground to see if we make an indention as deep as theirs but we couldnt, even with our shoes on. <BR><BR>We followed the tracks and we came to a barbwire fence. On the other side was a paved road. On the other side of the road was a hill that went up and overlooked a valley. I was too young to notice anything about how the tracks crossed the fence and got to the road or if there was a piece of fur on the barbs, so Im sorry that I couldnt tell you anymore about that. On the other side of the road there were no tracks and we couldnt find any more around. <BR><BR>My father decided that we needed the camera, so I stayed at the fence while he went back the way we came to get back to the truck. It seemed like it took forever for him to return and being a little kid I was getting a little scared. But, he finally came back and told me that he could not find the truck! So when we were done looking around we took the road that we had found to see where it would lead us. It took us to a small town that we had passed to get to our spot.

We had a cabin right on the border of Lake Mary and he had brought his two sheep dogs with him to the cabin. Every night he and I would take turns taking the dogs out for a walk. We would bring a flash light with us each time we went out to walk the dogs. <BR><BR>One night when I was walking the dogs, one of them started growling and I listened closely and could hear the rustling of fallen leaves and the breaking of small branches. I shined my light right at where I heard the sounds. Now both of the dogs were growling and pulling at the leash trying to get at whatever was in the forest. I looked around closely with the flashlight and then I saw something. A huge figure about 200 feet away from me was watching me and the dogs. It was kind of swaying between the trees and just staring right at me and the dogs. It looked like a very tall ape, but it looked more built like a human. <BR><BR>I was scared stiff and I must have stood there for a minute or two holding the dogs back and staring at the creature when it turned around and started walking away.

We arrived at the lakes at appx. 11 a.m. and fished until 2:30 p.m., at which time we decided to head back down the trail for home.  There were quite a few hikers in the area over the course of the day, appx. 13 hikers and a pack train consisting of 4 riders and 8 horses and a dog. Some coming in, some going out.  Anyway, we headed down the trail following the pack train.  We stopped on the way down to read the sign about the wagons that tried to use that trail way back in the day. I heard a noise like some one else coming down the trail behind us and told my family let''s get going.  The trail was pretty dry and dusty and my husband kept insisting that we give the hikers ahead of us some time so we could avoid walking in their dust. The next section of trail was slightly up hill so after cresting the top and going a short distance down the other side we stopped for a water break.  We heard what we thought was a shout, my son shouted back and something answered, but the echo was pretty bad, so we couldn''t make out what was being said.  We continued on down the trail and had just approached the south end of Leavitt Meadows, when my husband says \"What is that?\"  Both my son and I stopped and looked across the river toward the meadow.  From the beginning it was a strange sight, because this large black thing appeared to be floating across the meadow.  At first I thought it was a backpacker perhaps riding a bike, because it was moving so quickly across the meadow. It was moving quickly and smoothly.  It didn''t make sense.  If it was a back packer, to be moving that fast, he would have to be running and running with a back pack is anything but smooth; if he was riding a bike, then why couldn''t I see the bike and its arms and legs were in line with its body, not bent at an angle like it was sitting on something.  Also the color, I couldn''t figure out why a backpacker would be wearing black, black cap, black backpack, black pants, black coat.  It was at least 80-85 degrees.  We stood and watched silently for a time, perhaps 10-15 seconds.  The speed and smoothness with which it traveled was mesmerising.  Then my husband and son took off running further up the trail to another vantage point; they continued to watch it silently, then just shortly after I caught up to them, my son yelled, and the thing stopped and turned toward us.  It didn''t turn as a human would turn, even one wearing a backpack.  Then it began moving across the meadow again.  Not faster or slower, just the same floating type pace. <BR>We were on the trail above the meadow, looking down and appx. 500-800 yards a way from the object.  My husband believes the thing was following the pack trail. We left the trail and went down to the meadow.  We stayed on the trail side of the river.  The thing was on the opposite side of the river.  By this time it was gone or hidden from us.  The best way to describe it is like this.  The thing had a head that sat directly on its shoulders.  It did not appear to have a neck.  That is why we at first thought it was a backpacker.  It went head, broad shoulders or backpack, no neck, large body.  We could not discern its legs or arms due mostly to the angle at which it was leaving us. The grass in the Meadow obscured some of the legs. We have spent many hours in the woods, my husband was raised in Plumas county, neither he nor I have ever ever seen anything like this.  It could not have been a bear, they can''t walk that far on 2 legs, nor that smoothly or quickly.  ", :environment "Trail runs between ridge line and river.

It was late July of 1977. My family was up in the eastern Sierras, near Mono Lake, approx 13-15 miles above Conway Summit in an area known as Virginia Lakes. My dad told my brother and I to go to the lake and gather firewood. It was late in the day and the sun was down but it wasn''t dark yet, only dusk. I was 14 yrs old and my brother was 1 month shy of 16. He had his learners permit so we were allowed to take the truck.<BR>We got to the lake and started loading up some wood. I had just returned to the truck and dropped the wood when I heard, what I thought, was someone walking through the brush. The foot falls were very heavy, almost like someone was jumping, but the steps seemed pretty rapidly placed. Where we were gathering wood was near a large hedge of bushes, approx 6 to 7 feet high and very dense with only 1 path through the bush to skirt the lake without wading in the water. I turned to the bushes, where the sound was coming from, and saw the bushes shaking and bending, as if something large was moving through the bushes, making a lot of noise. I watched for a few seconds when my brother came running to the truck, white as a ghost and eyes bulging wide.<BR>I said,\"Jeff, what was that?\"<BR>He was scared and out of breath. \"I don''t know, but let''s get out of here.\" he said.<BR>We jumped back into the truck and drove all out. On the way back to the camp, he told me that he was only 10 or 15 feet away from it. He heard the stomping and crashing of the brush, and turned to see a large, dark-brown head above the bushes moving rapidly away from him. He didn''t see the face. <BR>He was so scared, he crashed the truck into a tree on the way back to camp. My dad was pretty pissed, to say the least, and didn''t believe our story, even when we were crying because of how frightened we were. He finally calmed down and said that we probably saw a bear. But, bears do not walk through heavy brush on 2 legs. And my brother swore that it was not a bear. I think my dad started to believe that we saw something since we both would not go out to the camp fire that night, and both of us refused to go to the lake alone for the rest of the trip.<BR>Since that time, I have told several people with very few people actually believing me. Most told me that big foot are only in the north-west in Oregan/Washington. But, after finding this website, I feel a bit vindicated.

I left my home in Manhattan Beach, California about 8:00 AM on the morning of February 16th after one last unsuccessful attempt to persuade my son to join me for a long weekend of wild pig hunting.  Monday was Presidents Day, my son was off school, and the Fort was open for hunting.  But 16-year old boys have other interests.  I arrived at the Fort about 12:30 PM alone, checked into Training Area 10/13 to hunt, and stopped at the Hacienda for lunch and to claim my room for the weekend.  After changing to camouflage clothing and hunting boots I headed up Sulfur Springs Road to where Training Area 10/13 begins.<BR><BR>About 4:30 PM I stopped to look at a creek that crosses under Sulfur Spring Road near Lyons Pond in Area 7 as I drove Northeast.  I learned of the creek that is often used as a wallowing spot, on a guided hunt in 1999.  From the road I could see much recent activity.  It appeared as though quite a few pigs had been wallowing in the small creek the night before.  I drove on about 150 yards and parked my Bronco along Sulfur Spring Road.  <BR><BR>I climbed down the 20-foot high embankment to the creek to check the area more carefully.  There were very fresh wallows all along the creek with many fresh droppings in addition. I walked on to Lyons Pond, which was dry, and returned to Sulfur Springs Road.  All of the fresh sign was in Area 7 at the edge of the road, but I was registered to hunt in Area 10/13on the other side of the road.  This is an important distinction at Hunter Liggett.  If you are caught with a loaded gun in an Area you are not registered to hunt, you are banned from the Fortforever.<BR><BR>I solved this conflict by noticing that the pigs appeared to be using a large culvert to cross under the road from Area 10/13 to Area 7.  I decided that I would wait for their return on the 10/13 side of the road.  I positioned myself about 10 yards off, and 20 feet below the road.  My hope was that the pigs would be traveling up the creek through Area 10/13 to Area 7 just after the sun set.  It was about 5:00 PM when I took my position with determination to not move until 30 minutes after sunset.  <BR><BR>The first hour of waiting was pretty boring.  Nothing was moving and the forest was eerily quite.  About an hour before sunset the woods began to show signs of life.  A few Blue Jays and Woodpeckers flew by and a few frog croaks resonated from the small creek I was watching.  Closer to sunset I noticed two does moving through the woods and squirrels scampering about.  I knew that if the pigs returned to the creek it would be in those magical 30 minutes after sunset and that time was just arriving!  <BR><BR>Much to my disappointment, a blue Ford Ranger also arrived as the sunset.  Two hunters climbed out, grabbed their rifles and walked down a small, grassy road that entered the woods about 75 feet from where I was sitting.  I watched them pass and disappear on the road that was slightly above my hidden sitting position.  My hopes of a pig encounter of the close kind were dashed.  I was certain these hunters would either intercept my prey or scare them away with their movement and noise.  <BR><BR>I was heartened a few minutes latter as I saw both hunters returning along the road to their truck.  I watched them carefully with my new Swarovski binocular.  It was about 10 minutes after sunset and without the binocular they appeared as shadows in the darkening forest.  With my Swarovski binocular I could see details of the weaving in the plaid hunting jacket one was wearing and the rifles they were carrying.  They climbed into their truck and drove offleaving me with 15 more minutes of wild pig hope.<BR><BR>These minutes passed slowly as I glassed the forest in search of movement.  The frogs in the creek began a loud chorus that added to the excitement.  There was lots of movement but no signs of pigs.  Chipmunks and squirrels were scampering about and I saw a coyote moving in the distance.  Drizzle started to fall, along with my hopes, as the last few minutes of hunting time expired.  I resolved to return to the same spot in the morning as I put the lens covers on my binocular and gather up my backpack and rifle.<BR><BR>But before I could stand up I saw a flash of light color a few 100 yards back into the forest.  I had no idea what I had seen out of the corner of my eye.  The color was white or silver-gray, not a color that I would expect to see on a wild pig.  I looked off into that direction for a few seconds before seeing another brief flash of the same light colored object.  Both confused and intrigued I watched as repeated flashes of white or silver-gray coloring appeared in the forest.  Whatever it was appeared to be moving and after about 20 seconds of watching I realized that it was moving in my direction along the same road the two hunters had walked earlier.<BR><BR>I believed I watched this creature move through the forest for about two or three minutes before I finally got a clear, unobstructed view of it against a light sky background.  My attitude was relaxed but attentive as I tried to figure out what I was seeing.  Patches of silver-gray flashed through openings in the forest, sometimes high, sometimes low!  My attitude changed to surprise and fright as I saw it take 4 or 5 full steps in a 30-foot clearing along the raised road, 75 feet from where I was sitting.  I was wide-awake, completely sober, free from any medications, and completely focused on this approaching object.  I was alone, watching with my naked eyes, and heavily armed.  I had a Model 70 in 300 Winchester magnum in my hands and was carrying a Tarus Raging Bull in 454 Casull on my belt.  <BR><BR>What the hell was it?  <BR><BR>I dont know!  <BR><BR>It was walking completely upright on two legs.  <BR><BR>It was very large.  I estimate that it was 8 feet tall and weighed 800 lbs.  Not 30 minutes before I had watched two hunters cross the same 30-foot opening and had thought how small they looked.  In contrast, I was surprised at how big this creature was.<BR><BR>It was covered with silver-gray hair from its very pointed head to its feet.  The only difference in coloration was a dark facial mask and similar colored palmsbrown or black.<BR><BR>I saw this creature in side profile and could make out few facial features.  What I could see appeared very flat, with little nose or chin protruding.  The silver-gray hair on the head rose about 8 from the top of the facial mask to a pronounced point at the top of the skull.  The head blended into the body without any visible neck in between.<BR><BR>The silver-gray hair on the arms was about 4 inches long.  I could see this clearly as these very long, heavily muscled arms swung in cadence with its fast, uninterrupted, strides.  Bulging back and shoulder muscles flexed visibly under the hair as it strode along the road.<BR><BR>It was not carrying nor wearing anything.  Both hands were empty.  There were no shoes, belt, pack or anything else that would suggest cultural development or advanced intelligence.<BR><BR>Four long, powerful strides in a clear opening against the still light Western sky and it was gone!  <BR><BR>I was dumbfounded!  What the hell had I just seen?  It took me about 10 seconds to grab my backpack and start running up the 10 grade to Sulfur Spring Road to get another look.  I slipped to one knee as I scrambled up the hill and pulled my Raging Bull out of its holster as I reached the road.  My heart was racing and my hands were trembling but it wasnt from the runningI was pretty damn scared!<BR><BR>It was 40 minutes past sunset, but I was looking West toward an open field on the other side of the road, the direction in which this creature was headed.  There was nothing movingI couldnt see or hear any sign of what I had just seen.  I walked slowly down the center of the Sulfur Spring Road toward the point where the other road connected.  I called out a number of times to see if anyone or anything would respond.  Nothing did.  After a few minutes I slowly walked backward down the center of Sulfur Spring Road toward my Bronco that was parked about 200 yards East of where I had been hunting.<BR><BR>I jumped in and locked the doors!  I turned it around and slowly drove back toward the Hacienda with the bright lights searching for any signs of movement along the road.  The drizzle turned to serious rain as I reached the Hacienda.  I went directly to the restaurant for dinner and a few glasses of wine.  I chatted with two other hunters seated at the same table.  We exchanged stories of seeing deer and fresh pig sign in the areas we had hunted.  They told me of seeing a flock of wild turkeys run across their path in Area 7, not far from the Hacienda.  I didnt say a word about what I had just seen.  I was sure they would think I was nuts.   I was sure because I was beginning to wonder myself!<BR><BR>It rained hard all night.  <BR><BR>A heavy rain continued until about 11:00 AM Sunday morning.  <BR><BR>I left the Hacienda an hour before sunrise on February 17th headed back to the spot where I had seen this unbelievable creature.  I parked in the same spot as the day before, and loaded my rifle and pistol before I unlocked the door as the sky began to gray in the East.  I watched the creek for pigs until about 30 minutes after sunrise, then began looking for footprints along the small road where I had seen what appeared to be a silver-gray Sasquatch.<BR><BR>The road was covered with grass and extended only about 200 yards from Sulfur Spring Road to where it dead-ended at a small ravine. There were few patches of bare dirt and no tracks.  Either the grassy road didnt show tracks or the rain had washed them away. Or, perhaps, there had been nothing to leave tracks in the first placeonly an over active imagination!<BR><BR>From the end of the road I slowly still-hunted toward an adjacent ridge.  It was a few hundred feet above the surrounding ground and offered a good vantage point to glass for movement.  While I kept my eyes open for pigs, I was really looking for something silver-gray.  I saw neither.  At noon, I returned to Sulfur Spring Road and walked back into Area 7.  Lyons pond had little new water in it despite the heavy rain over the last 18 hours.  There were few pig and deer tracks on the bare dirt as the heavy rain had washed most of the tracks away.  I saw no sign of any tracks that might have been left by the beast I saw the night before.  <BR>", :environment "The immediate area is a low lying wooded area along a small creek.

I was working for the US Forest Service on the Monterey Ranger District (Arroyo Seco Station). One the first things we had to do before the day began was go on a 2-mile fitness run. I dont remember the specific day. I began my run about 8:30 am about 3/4 of the way through the run I began to fall behind the crew. I came to area known as the Abbott lakes area. I stopped to catch my breath. I then heard a noise off to my left on the hillside. The hillside was covered with oak trees, poison oak and thick brush.  The side of the hill was shaded from the sun so I had really looked hard to see what was hearing. I noticed what appeared to a man walking up the hill about 20 feet in front of me. I then realized that this was to tall and to wide to be a person. It was about 8 feet tall. It stopped, turned its head and stared back at me for about 30 seconds. When it turned the whole upper body turned with head. I could not see its face because of the shade. It turned and walked up the hill. I ran back to the station knowing what I seen was not human.  Later that day I was with my supervisor alone and I asked him if he ever seen anything weird near the lakes or the bone yard (trash area). He looked at me and said \"oh you seen it to\" he later went on to tell that other members of forest service seen it to. He states that the season prior that one employee said he seen close up and it was covered with hair. I just blew it off. A month later I was placed on the night shift with one other person.  One of the things was to check the bone yard area for campers. One evening we drove into the bone yard and about 30 feet in front of us was a dark, 8-foot thing walking away from our vehicle.  I did not say anything to my partner until we drove out of the area. She turned to me and said, \"Did you see that?\" I then asked her what the hell is it. She told me she had seen several times in past.  That was the last time I seen it that season.<BR><BR>The 1995 fire season came around and due to budget problems only 3 people were on for the season. This made me nervous because this meant I would work alone 3 days a week. I avoided the bone yard area at all cost when I worked alone.  Halfway though the season a coworker and myself drove into the bone yard area to pick a picnic table.  My partner had a bad habit of wanting to catch a wild turkey for pet so as we drove up he took off running after a turkey that was about 40 feet from our truck. I did not see the turkey once I got off the truck but ran in the direction that my partner was running in.  As I got closer I realized that this was not a turkey we were chasing. As I got a better look at it I realized what I was looking at I only seen the upper body of it because it was walking down a slope. It had turtle shaped head and what appeared to be long tail coming from it. It moved at very fast pace away from us. I backed off, as did my partner.  I took notice of noise that it made as it walked away. I lost sight of it but I could still hear it running through the brush. That was my last season at this station.

We knew it was the sound of an animal but what kind, we couldn''t tell.  We were frightend!  As we listened we realized that he was getting closer, we could hear the bushes crush under him as he pushed his way through them.  We could tell by the sound that he was very huge and coming fast.

I immediately pulled over to the side of the roadway on the bridge and slowed so that I could see it better (traffic was extremely light -two other cars.)

They both continued across the stream and into the tree line on the east side and disappeared. I sat there trying to evaluate what I had seen. I then concluded that these forms were not any animals I''ve ever seen. They were one solid color from head to toe with no discernable clothing. They had nothing in their hands or on their feet.

We went to an area that had a little lake with an un-improved campground. My parents went up there that Friday morning and we went after work as Brian and I worked at the same place. We picked up Steve on the way out there. We got to the lake at around 9pm Friday night, and after setting up our camp, we sat and talked half the night. The camp was on the north end of the lake. There was a marsh area that had very thick underbrush to the immediate west of our camp. This marsh area extended to almost the southwest of the lake. If you picture a clock, the marsh area would be from the 8''0 clock to the 12''0 clock position. <BR><BR>After spending all day Saturday fishing with my folks and having a great time, we all settled down and relaxed at the camp. We had dinner and built a campfire and we all stared into the fire telling stories until my folks went to bed. At around midnight, Steve, Brian and I were sitting around the fire when I thought I heard something in the marsh area. It sounded like something walking through there. Steve didn''t hear it and I just dismissed it at first. But Brian and I kept hearing it. It soundedd like something going back and forth like it was pacing the camp. I knew no one was camped in that area, so I just thought it was an animal. This went on for about an hour and a half. I even jokeed to Steve that the tent he and Brian were sleeping in was just giftwrap to a bear if one came after them and I''d sleep really good in the back of my truck.<BR><BR>The next morning my folks decided to go home early. My friends and I decided to stay there a couple more days because Brian and I didn''t have to go to work until the following Thursday. By two that afternoon, we pretty much had the whole lake all to ourselves except for a couple of other groups of campers. At 2:30 Sunday afternoon, the three of us piled into my truck to hunt for firewood. We took a dirt road that went east to west along a ridge directly off of the lake''s entrance road about 1/8th mile from our camp. We were following this road in a pretty thick patch of woods for about a mile when it suddenly opened up into a meadow about 300 meters below the ridgeline of the hill we were on. There was another patch of woods to our south that paralleled the road for about 2 or 3 miles. I stopped the truck because we saw a ton of good firewood. <BR><BR>Brian and Steve went in a southeast direction away from the front of the truck while I grabbed my axe and headed in a northern direction towards some logs so we could get some \"all night burners\". I got about 30 ft from the truck when I saw it.<BR><BR>At first I didn''t know what I was seeing. It was a hairy thing sitting down against a tree with it''s back towards me. It was in the treeline we had just come out of. It was only 60 yards from me at most. I stood there frozen because I thought it might be a bear and I only had an axe and I didn''t feel like being any kind of hero. After maybe 5 seconds, it stood up on 2 legs. It looked massive, like 8 to 8 1/2 foot tall and at least 3 1/2 to 4 feet wide. It had reddish-brown hair all over it and it matched the color of the bark on the trees perfectly. It had huge hands that came down to just above it''s knees. It grabbed onto the trees just to guide itself through them, not push them aside. There were some pretty good sized trees in that patch of woods and they looked small when this thing grabbed them. It walked away from me towards the crest of the hill and I was amazed at how smoothly it moved. <BR><BR>It was weaving in and out of the trees stealthily and it never made a sound, not a grunt, not a wheeze, nothing. I didn''t even hear footsteps. As it got near the top of the hill, it stopped and looked down into the next valley to the North and it just walked on over the hill never even looking back at me. I couldn''t see it''s face. I didn''t see a neck either, just it''s head set kinda on top of it''s shoulders. <BR><BR>I stood there for about 10 seconds when I got the nerve up to get the hell out of there. I backed down the hill to the truck and I noticed that Brian and Steve were still gathering wood. I joined up with them after I got a soda from the truck and I calmed down. I gathered some wood with them and we got out of there. They never saw it. We stayed there another couple of nights, but we didn''t have another incident for the whole trip. I didn''t tell them what I saw because they wouldn''t have believed it.

No animals were scurrying or foraging.<BR>By nightfall, the area was nearly silent.  The only noises were the occasional cars passing on the bridge.<BR>We decided to do some exploring up the river after breakfast.  It was still quiet.  we wanted to find good rocks for climbing and jumping into the river.<BR>About a 1/4 mile upstream, we stopped at a formation that came up from the banks about 30 to 40 feet.

There were also many trees and bushes.<BR>There was a deep crevasse near the water level that was 4 to 5 feet wide and full of growth.  we thought that it would be fun to find a way across the river and climb it.  At that moment, my friend Jeff noticed a rustling behind the shrubs in the crevasse.  He got our attention and we all checked it out.  A moment later, we saw a large, hairy figure move into an opening in the crevasse, in a crouching position.  It was crouched on the two rear feet and the front right paw was grasping a tree (to maintain balance?)  The hair was dark brown, and all over the body.  Although we didn''t see it stand up as it moved up the crevasse, we could tell that it was well over 6 feet tall, probably closer to 7 feet.  The face of the creature had no snout, but rather a flat face, much like a primate.  The rear paws looked much like human feet, but larger, maybe a foot and a half long.  As it went higher into the crevasse, it entered a darker area thick with trees and manzanita, at which point we lost it.<BR>At this time, we decided to leave and get back to our campsite as fast as possible, always glancing back to see if the creature was behing us.

We had arrived early in the afternoon, set up camp, I shot a can or two with my pistol, ate dinner, and had settled in for the evening (it was about sunset), and we had heard this fairly high pitched \"moan\" or wail, that continued off and on throughout the evening. It seemed to be coming from up the hill at first, and if I had to guess, within 300 yards. Well, as time went on, we heard  the noise move down the hill and down the side of the mountain, which is extremely hard to traverse. My dad and I kept speculating as to what it was, as he had hunted bear, deer, and elk, and could not place what it was. We thought, from the tone, that it could have been a lost animal, as it had a mournful tone to it. It had a very resonant quality to it, like it was a good sized animal. Anyway, the noise seemed to move along the side of us, and then we would hear it back at its original location rather quickly. I briefly thought that it was a large bird that kept flying back and forth, but it finally dawned on my dad that there was two sounds; they seemed to be calling to each other; that unnerved me, and my father and I went to take a look with our spotlights and me with my pistol and camera (I always carry a little disposable camera in case I see a bear or deer). We walked up the hill, (on the dirt road), maybe 50 yards and saw nothing; when we got back to camp, I jumped in my truck and drove up the hill maybe 3-400 yards and saw nothing; I did not get out of my truck to look around as I was highly agitated (read:pretty dang spooked) I turned around and kept flashing my spotlight down the side of the mountain occasionally and went past camp down the hill on to Foresthill Road and drove up the road a little ways before turning around again and heading to camp. My dad and brother reported that they had heard nothing and it was quiet for awhile. I sat around the fire and watched the tv that my dad had brought with him; my brother was tired and had gone to bed fairly early. Everything seemed fairly quiet until I went to go \"number one\" by a big pine tree across the road and as I was juggling with the belt that was holding my pistol in its holster, I heard that noise behind the tree and it seemed like it was maybe 30 yards down the hill, it startled me, to say the least, and I ran back to the relative safety of the campfire holding up my pants with one hand and my pistol with the other, much to my dads amusement. Needless to say, I did not venture from camp the rest of the night. We continued to hear the noises until we went to bed, around 0330 or so, I remember hearing it around 0345 and yelling to my dad (he slept in the back of his camper, my brother and I in my tent, 15 ft away) \"there it is again!\", but he was sleepy. I finally drifted off to sleep shortly thereafter and no noise was heard again.<BR>THE \"NOISE\": Resonant. Very similar to the \"Howl\" on your website, but of a shorter duration, 2-3 seconds or so each time. <BR>A note about my father and brother: my brother was very tired from working the night before and he drank quite a bit of beer on this evening; he may have also thought that I was trying to \"spook\" him as he does not go camping much. He was disinterested and does not remember much.<BR>My fathers curiosity was piqued, but he was not agitated or spooked like I was; his philosophy is that humans are the most dangerous creatures out in the forest,and this was an animal, though he was not sure what it was and still doesnt. Also, he states that I heard brush or sticks being broken, but I cant recall stating that.

Later, we were all back and sitting around four different fires and talking about the day.  One by one we went back to our tents or cots and sleeping bags.  The last thing I remember before I went to sleep was both of the commanders talking about tomorrow''s set up and that was it, or so I thought.<BR><BR>Well, I was rolling over in my cot and slightly awake when, well for the lack of a better word, heard a \"howling sound\".  I, in all my life, have never heared anything like it before. It cried out eight or nine times . After a few moments there was nothing, so I got tired and went back to sleep, but only because the sound wasn''t too close to the camp.  It sounded like it came from where we where battling that day up on the ridge, about half a mile from us.<BR><BR>I woke up again about one hour later. I had to use the bathroom, I put on my boots and walked over to a bush to relieve myself, and on the way back I heard it again, but this time it was much closer.  It was right down the road from us and it was loud, very loud, and I know that this time I wasn''t the only one to hear it.   Several times it let out . one after another.  This time it was much more deep and clear to the ear. My unit commander and several of the other unit people woke up. To my and their knowledge, we didn''t know what to do . No matter what I did, I could not stay awake but before I went back to sleep, I loaded my gun with real bullets and put my bayonet under my blanket near my pillow. What ever it was, if it came into camp and hurt me or anyone, I was going to kill it.  We heard it two more times that night, each time it was further away. <BR><BR>When we woke up that next morning, many people were confused and in denial about what happened.

Over the last three years the local paper, the Feather River Bulletin, has reported seven different sightings in the same general area of the county. Five of those may have been hoaxed, but two deserve further discussion.<BR><BR>The first one occurred at 1:15 a.m. on February 13,1994. Mary and Jerry Cain, Quincy''s only bakers, were returning from Reno. Near Lee Summit, ten miles east of town, a large fur covered animal crossed Hwy. 70 in front of their car and strolled up a steep bank and into the forest. It looked exactly like the many drawings they''d seen of Bigfoot. They doubt this was someone dressed in a Gorilla costume. When it was light, Mary and Jerry returned to the scene and found large, deep footprints in the snow. They took pictures of the prints, wrote a narrative of their adventure and posted the information on the wall of their bakery.

I dont know the original author. <BR> <BR>I hiked to the bottom of the Middle Fork drainage where the Pacific Crest Trail crosses the river from the Quincy side (North side) so I could brush it out and cut some poles and logs laying across the trail. First day I had a couple guys with me, and we knocked out a good portion of it that day. I came back later in the week to finish up the remaining few miles by myself. <BR><BR>The tactic is to go down the trail heavy with water and saw gas and work your way back up getting lighter.  I worked my way down the trail maybe about 2 and a half hours to the area where we left off. I started cutting my way back up the trail. The logs were spread apart with patches of down logs and then areas of clear trail for several minutes of hiking.<BR> <BR>In the periods when I shut the saw off, I soon started to realize I was getting side hilled by something that was downslope of me off the trail about maybe 100 to 150 feet just inside the tree line. As I moved up the trail it did also. If it was a lion, I would have never heard it and bears are very noisy coming through the brush. This was not wildlife; this was CLEARLY a bipedal footfall. <BR><BR>By the time most of my work was done. I was getting a little spooked and I just wanted to get back up to the landing where my truck was parked. Unfortunately, I never got eyes on it so I cant give you a visual account.  I was only able to occasionally see saplings move. To be perfectly honest I was too afraid to look. I had my head down humping gear up the trail, I was light and moving at good clip on a trail. This thing was EASILY able to outpace me even though it was working through steep rocky brush and tree covered terrain. At times it got ahead of me because of the contour of the land and that was a little bit horrifying. This thing was agile and fast.

I had drank no alcohol before going to bed so I slept fairly lightly.<BR><BR>I awoke at 4:50am. Just as I awoke, I heard a loud sound that seemed to me to be someone hitting a treetrunk with a large branch. I lifted my head in the tent and looked around for any light sources and saw none. I also heard no voices. I was intrigued enough to continue listening. Our closest neighbor had a Dachsund and the next closest had two larger dogs that were tied up outside their tent. Once I heard the first loud sound the outside dogs started moving around but didn''t bark. They made some moaning sounds but that''s all.<BR><BR>From what I could tell, as far as sounds, something or someone walked through the campground from lower to higher through a ravine. It had very heavy footsteps. It sounded like it broke fairly large branches on the ground. Once it crossed the campground''s asphalt, the neighboring dogs started crying, whimpering and moaning. I then heard what sounded like a rock or something similar, being thrown against a tree near our tent and falling to the ground. Right at the crescendo of the crunching branches I decided to get up and unzip our tent window and at the same time the tent of the owners of the dogs opened and a woman came out and grabbed the dogs to quiet them down. That was the last I heard of the crunching, footstep sounds. Also, there had been crickets making noise all night until this event. Once this started, the cricket noise reduced to only crickets at a great distance. By the end of the incident there were no forest sounds at all.<BR><BR>The next morning, we walked over to the ravine that I thought I had heard the biped walking through and found no footprints due to the extremely dry ground. I spoke to a family right next to the ravine and they had heard nothing that night but had heard footsteps the night before.

San Jacinto, specifically Round Valley. This was the third year we had done this and the plan was to spent the night at 9200 feet and do the peak the next day. Spend another night in Round Valley and go back down the mountain the third day. The place we set camp was on the south east side of Round Valley with some large granite boulders to give us some shelter if the wind picked up. Surrounding our camp were ponderosa and jeffrey pines and not too far away was a small stream. This was early June and there were still some snow drifts in the shaded places.<BR>    My son and I had eaten dinner and were getting ready for bed. At about 10:00 p.m. we were in our sleeping bags, but still talking and planning the trip to the peak in the morning. Suddenly without warning we heard a loud, low pitched whooping call in the boulders just above us. The hair on the back of my neck stood up and my son asked me if that was a monkey and I, not wanting to deal with a panicked 7 year old, told him it was just an owl. We did not smell anything or hear footsteps. Everything calmed down and we finally fell asleep. About an hour later I heard a load boom that sounded close to the tent. I looked out the window in the tent and saw a few clouds in the moonlight so I pulled our boots into the tent in case we got a thunderstorm in the night.<BR>    The next morning we got up and had breakfast, then headed for the peak. We made the peak but by the time we got back to camp my knees were swollen and sore so I put some snow in a sandwich bag for a cold pack that evening to reduce the swelling for the trip out the next morning. That night was uneventful and we slept well in the high altitude air. The next morning we got up and began to pack up for our trip off the mountain. I went up on top of the boulders to make sure none of our trash had blown away from camp and make sure everything was picked up. I then saw what had made that load boom the night before last. 30 yards from our tent on top of those boulders was an 8 inch diameter ponderosa pine snapped off at the base. The tree was still green and fresh and had no rot in it and there was no wind to speak of either night. The only explanation I can come up with is that the animal that made that whooping sound had pushed the tree over. The tree was not aimed in the direction of our tent but rather parallel the direction our tent was pitched.

We were out-packing, not in a campground.<BR><BR>We were awakened by screams that resembled the sound of a pack of coyotes that had just made a kill right outside of our tent. The screams however had a bit of a deeper tone than a coyote. At the time that is what we thought it was, so we stayed quiet not wanting to interrupt a wild animals meal. The screams and screeches continued for what seemed like an hour, but was probably about 5 or 10 minutes.

No birds, no crickets, nothing.  I was still scared to go outside, but did.<BR><BR>I could see that something was in our camp, due to the scattering of pine needles and dirt around our tent. But there was no sign of a coyote kill, like no blood or fur laying around. What I did see was a pair of big deep footprints going away from our site down into a deeply wooded ravine. The thing, what ever it was, walked upright, and had a 3 to 4 foot gait.  I followed the steps for a few yards down into the ravine while my girlfriend watched. It was still deathly quiet and I had a very eerie feeling that I was being watched. The footprints led right into a thicket and I could see it was a wide path left by whatever it was. I turned and ran back up the hill, packed our stuff up in a big hurry and left.<BR><BR>At that time I was in my early 20''s.

During that first fall I would hear a strange whistling call that would come from a Sequoia tree that stands out in about 2 acres of blackberries that surrounds my yard. The berries run down to a thermal spring on the property that itself runs down to I creek, which is around 50 ft. further up the hill from that creek.<BR><BR>I thought this was a stray bird of maybe a tropical sort perhaps lost by someone. It would call to me in a guttural clicking sound followed by a series of sing song chirping whistles. I would call back, and then it to me and so on and so forth for around 20 minutes to 45 minutes before it would stop. It was always at dusk towards night and so I would call it a \"night bird\".<BR><BR>There have also been numerous times that I smell a strong wet garbage smell that shows up suddenly in my yard and house. The latest incident is taking place around every few days now, at least for the last three and one half months. This smell shows up in the late spring and usually stays around off and on through the last apples falling from the fruit trees on my property. I rent.<BR><BR>I have sensed something looking at me from the steep hill across the road from my house that comprises my back yard. Sort of like the feeling one gets when a puma is near. <BR><BR>The other night I had an incident where the creature I am talking about banged on my trailer at around four in the morning. When I went outside on the porch to see if it was somebody, I had every single hair on my body go up instantly. I just knew that whatever it was; was right there. I beat feet into the house and locked the door. The early morning smell was so strong that I couldn''t even sleep. It smelled like a garbage dump. I have been around lions and have had the hairs on the back of my neck go up, but never anything remotely like this.<BR><BR>I have heard very heavy thumps coming down the hill behind my house late at night many times during these same seasons. They sound like very heavy footfall. There is one particularly loud thump that I can hear that I think I have identified as this thing as it jumps from the road next to my house down into the my yard on its way to the creek.<BR><BR>I have seen it twice now. The first time was around four in the morning when I walked out of my trailer onto my front porch. The door squeals so it makes a lot of noise and when I opened it I must have startled the thing.<BR><BR>At first I thought I had just seen the biggest bear of my life until it registered in my head that it was running on two long legs, crouched over. I noticed that it was swinging two very long arms. It was the fastest moving animal I have ever seen. [In 2005] I reported it to a place here called J.Bs deli and was put in touch with [Carmine (Tom) Biscardi -- a.k.a. \"the Great American Bigfoot Research Team\"]. They came and investigated and now I have a live video feed coming from two spots near the creek.<BR><BR>The second time I saw it was at around one- thirty in the morning a few weeks later. I noticed the apple tree in the far corner of my yard going berserk. The big branches were really shaking hard. I had a night vision scope so I took it outside and looked through it but the tree settled down and I did not see anything so I sat the scope down. When I looked back over there I saw a human form from mid upper arm up walking towards the creek at the edge of the berry bushes. The bushes are around six plus feet tall, and this thing was perhaps two feet taller. I saw large rounded head on very large rounded, thick shoulders. It seemed to have very little neck. I could see that it was hairy and got quite a good view because it was silhouetted by a light on my neighbors porch.<BR><BR>My daughter was staying in a tent out in the yard a few nights later and was awakened by some whistling and then by something hitting her tent. Like something had been thrown.<BR><BR>There has been a print found on my property also. It is around 19 inches long and about 8 inches wide. I have never seen anything like it, but it looks like a giant human footprint to me.<BR><BR>These incidences are ongoing. I think this thing summers here. What do you think? Also, do you have any suggestions on your experience as to how I may be able to study it or observe it here?<BR>I would be delighted at any input. <BR><BR>Excerpts from Report # 12910                                           October 27, 2005<BR>OBSERVED: I have new possible evidence on the hill behind my house that I and a few friends of mine have found, and we desperately want someone more qualified to look at what we have here. I would appreciate talking to someone ASAP so that I can connect with you for a possible story.<BR><BR>For two years I have heard a whistle and chuffing sounds coming from the berries bushes in my yard. I thought it was some lost big tropical bird. I would call back to it, and it would call back, and so forth. I have had some bad odor incidences including one that woke me up from a dead sleep and gagged me.<BR><BR>A volunteer found a footprint up the hill behind my house and some friends of mine, [T. C.] and [N. M.] found additional footprints and hand prints in an area up the hill from my house that appears to be some form of crude camp. I have been there three times now and the second time I went there I observed that some 4-5 inches around 4-5 ft. long branches have been brought from some where other than that location and laid in a sort of rectangle fashion around a depression in the earth. There are more of these depressions without branch borders in the area. <BR><BR>There are snapped trees at @ the 10 ft. level; there are \"huts\", for a lack of a better term made from big branches. Some look older and some look recently made. There are also snapped trees and tracks that seem to form a path from this site down the hill towards my house. [N. M.] Found two pretty fresh handprints that appear to be coming out from one of the \"huts\". The finger tips are spread much farther a part than a human could have done. We found three separate footprints there that did not seem to be very old, maybe a couple of weeks, but no more.<BR><BR>I saw the Bigfoot three times now, once at 4 AM in the morning, and twice at 1 AM in the morning. It was very dark each time except once it walked in front of a light and I got a good look at its height and silhouette.<BR><BR>Excerpters from Report # 20720:                                        August 09, 2007 <BR>It was four thirty in the morning as I opened the sliding glass door to my trailer looking east towards my yard and I Creek; I thought to myself, that''s the biggest bear that I have ever seen. As it stood up from the blackberries in my yard it was eating, I saw two long arms and two very long legs. It began to run north towards the path I have that goes thru the berries to the creek, and I said to myself'' \"that''s not a bear\". I knew I had just seen a Bigfoot. WOW!!!<BR><BR>I saw it run towards the creek and I heard it crashing through the bushes down there. I did not follow. I''m not usually a scared kind of person, but I did not follow because I was scared. I had never seen anything like that in my life. I live in the woods and I have seen lots of bears and large animals. I  consider myself good at estimating, so I estimated it as 10 to 12 ft. tall and it probably weighed somewhere in the neighborhood of 1200 lbs. no lie.<BR><BR>Later that day I went down and looked on the trail the way it had gone. I found horse hair ferns that had been torn out from an area of about a thirty foot radius where something had torn them out and made a large \"bed\", for lack of a better word, there on the ground near a natural spring that comes out from under a maple tree. I walked down to the creek and found the tops of two very large footprints in the sand at the very edge of the creek. The prints disintegrated into the water as I watched them, but I was pretty freaked out by then.  <BR>          <BR>On with the story...<BR>Every night for a whole summer I would smell it in my yard, it smelled like a mixture of wet dog, garbage and sewer...if you can imagine that.<BR><BR>One night the smell woke me up gagging. I thought it was a bag of garbage I had left out on the porch that night. You see, it is so much easier to stay in a sort of denial when you see these things. It really is too hard to believe what you are encountering. Anyway, the cameras were up in my yard at that point and I had these computers in my house so I sat down at the computer and started looking at my emails. <BR><BR>There is a window right next to my sliding glass door where my porch and stairs are. I heard a small sound behind me at that window while my back was turned away at the monitor and when I looked I saw a huge dark face in that window. The face was tilted slightly and I could make out the shiny spots at the brow and bridge of the nose. It was very dark outside and what I saw was the reflection of the things face in the light from the dining room. I looked at it and it looked back at me for a few seconds and then it turned away. A few seconds later I heard a loud bang as it slammed something into the end of the trailer. I looked later and found a big dent.<BR><BR>I got up and ran out onto the porch. I actually thought it was pranksters. I got out on the porch and noticed how dark it was in the yard at that point. I yelled, \"Get out of here!\" I thought that would scare away any kids that might be in my yard when suddenly every hair in my body stood on end. Have you ever been around a lion when the hairs on the back of you neck stand up, Yeah kind of like that, but about 50 times stronger?  I suddenly thought...man, this thing is right here in the yard with me. I promptly panicked...ran inside...and locked my door.<BR><BR>A few nights later I saw it walk across my property. There is a field light across my property in my neighbors yard and I saw it backlit as it walked down to the creek. I saw a tall figure...@12 ft. tall with large mounded shoulders and a sort of conical shaped head. I saw very long arms swinging as it walked. I could only see the top portion of this guy because it was walking by 8 ft. tall blackberry bushes.<BR><BR>I went up on the hill behind my house with a friend and we found a footprint up there. It freaked me out too because I wasnt expecting to find anything to tell you the truth. We made a cast and I would very much like to have that cast. I heard it is in litigation.<BR><BR>I have been up the hill above my house since then and I have found places with big holes in the ground where \"beds\" have been made. Some of them have crude frames in them made from 12 inch diameter snapped off branches that are crisscrossed to form frames. I thought that was strange. In those places there are numerous foot and handprints.<BR>", :environment "There are two water features on this property that may be of interest.

Five years ago I interviewed a group of young people regarding a sighting. The sighting took place in the Mojave rive bed in Hesperia California. The first report came from five teenage boys who were exploring down in the riverbed late in the after noon when a noise in the dense under brush that grows in places along the river startled them.<BR><BR>They said the noise sounded like something big moving through it. When they moved closer to get a look they said they saw a large hairy ape like creature. As this frightened them, the boys ran home and told their parents, which is when I first heard the story. The boys father went down into the area of the sighting with a gun to see if he could see what the boys had reported, but found nothing. <BR><BR>The boys older sister rode her horse down to the spot on two consecutive days, to try and get a look at the creature. On the second day, her efforts were rewarded. In her statement to me she said, \"I was riding north in the river bed on my way home after searching for several hours, when I came to an area where there are two stands of cottonwood and pepper trees one on each side of the trail. My horse spooked and didn''t want to go on. I looked around and to my right I saw a tall hairy thing standing there looking at me. It looked at me for about a minute, then I turned my horse and ran her in the opposite direction and took another trail home.\" <BR><BR>I investigated the area and though I wasn''t able to see the Bigfoot itself, I did find what seemed to be a nest of sorts where the animal had been bedding down. I also found footprints that measured twenty inches by eleven inches. These prints were in very soft deep river sand so I''m sure the size is out of proportion, but maybe this will assist you in determining the animals size. When I asked the young woman about color she said it was a dark brown or black. I didn''t think about it after making my own documentation until I read the recent article in the Mohave Daily News Archives.<BR><BR> After reading the article I thought my information might be useful to you. My neighbor took some pictures of the footprints, and though they are of very poor quality I might be able to acquire them for you if you want.

Three different Mt. ranges intersect the base itself and I am very familiar with every nook and cranny on its over 200,000 acres of mountains, ridges, ravines, canyons, trails, back roads and the like.<BR><BR>Anyway on one particular calm night after a long grueling day of forced marches, displays and demonstrations we took all 300 boys up to a bivouac site for the night. The site is situated on large, open meadow shelf above the Infantry Training School at San Onofre/52 area. The boys were exhausted yet eagerly setting up their shelter-halves. They began to get a little too loud, so I began to quiet them and bed them down for the night. The rest of the staff was situated about 35 meters away, up on a little knoll that overlooked the boys. However, I wasn''t aware that the staff had already bedded down and that I was the last one still up except for the radio watch, which was half asleep too.<BR><BR>It had become dark with exception of a bit of starlight, which gave me a very good range of vision. Finally I succeeded in getting the kids in the sack and quiet. I then stood for a few moments to ensure all was secure and that not one peep could be heard and none could be.<BR><BR>As I turned facing west and looked towards the closest edge of the perimeter I noticed a tall, dark, bulky figure standing about 15 meters beyond the last tent or 20 meters from where I stood. We seemed to be staring at each other, but it&#8217;s hard to say because I could not make out any of its facial definition, but I had a strong gut feeling that it was checking me out real good since I was the only thing moving around. I could feel my heart begin to pound and my entire body felt like it wanted to anchor to the ground. There was no doubt someone or something very odd and dangerous was standing there looking at me. I mean this thing was TALL and wide at the shoulders.<BR><BR>I used my peripheral vision to make sure I wasn''t seeing things, but it only confirmed what I already knew. It gently and slightly moved its upper body left and right ever so slowly as though looking around to its front, surveying the area. It was an easy 8 feet tall. Like I mentioned previously, all I could make out was its massive silhouette and no real detail features. It had very broad shoulders, little or no neck, dark, and looked very powerful.<BR><BR>I decided to go get a flashlight out of our vehicle at the top of the knoll and let staff know what was going on. So I began to cautiously and quietly step backwards to prevent whatever it was from charging or coming into bivouac. I continued to keep an eye on the dang thing, which just remained in the same spot. Almost halfway up the knoll I lost sight of it, but I continued to move slowly still trying to locate it. From atop of the knoll it was very difficult to see anything clearly outside the fringe of perimeter because of the dark.<BR><BR>I walked back down to the tents, scanned the area with the flashlight, but didn&#8217;t see anything like I had before. The figure had obviously moved. So instead of waking anybody up I sat up for a while and waited to see what and if anything would happen. I also hoped the darn thing wouldn''t pop up behind me (we were all unarmed). It would have been worse and maybe a calamity if I had  pushed the panic button and had waken everybody up. After all, we were in charge of nearly 300 young street kids without any formal training, out in the open and I didn&#8217;t need the grief if nothing I said or described could have been verified. Thankfully nothing else occurred that night.<BR><BR>In the morning just before daybreak I bee-lined for the spot where I saw the thing standing. There wasn''t anything there ... nothing. Not a pole, a bush, a tree, a reed.  I mean nothing that could have simulated what I had seen. We were situated on flat, clear open ground with exception of the knoll and a tree line about 50 to 60 meters away and a mountain behind that which I knew all existed and had seen back-dropped way beyond the figure the previous evening.<BR><BR>The ground was grassy, but was already pretty well matted down and rutted by the constant foot and vehicle movement in that particular training area. I know I saw something that wasn''t normal. I know  it wasn''t hoax, I know it wasn&#8217;t the kids (they were all accounted for). I trust my judgment and I&#8217;m now 46 years old and still have perfect vision. I know it wasn''t any of the staff because I had seen all of them sleeping when I got up the hill.

Now, in the Lagunas around Julian, in San Diego County, I have been actively pursuing reports of Bigfoot in these mountains and the Anza-Borrego Desert below, and most particularly within a certain Indian Reservation. In February, 1981, I happened to be at the right place at the right time to meet a young Indian who talked openly of his interest in Bigfoot and said he had seen him on his reservation and knew the location of caves where Bigfoot hid, and he would take me there - now!<BR><BR>He guided me up a fearfully storm-wrecked road. My ancient van was not designed for such, nor my senior years to cope, but once started there was no turning back. Disaster seemed certain but I would die TRYING! We reached a small flat. \"Park here,\" my escort said. \"Now we hike down a canyon.\"<BR><BR>He hiked ahead rapidly and I eventually caught up with him - napping under a bush. Below him, a small stream followed a darkened canyon around a bend. I had parked in bright sunshine and in less than a mile we had descended into sunless gloom. \"The caves are over there, but I am NOT about to go there.\" <BR><BR>Until my guide refused to enter a taboo area, I had not really believed his story. I knew that no money or incentive on earth will induce an Indian to enter taboo ground. \"Okay, now we wait. Have a seat.\" I said to him, \"What are we waiting for?\" He said, \"To watch. He comes out this time of the day and walks around. He drinks from those old rock-troughs I showed you by the road. Sometimes he hangs out by that wrecked house where the road loop starts. You in a hurry?\" <BR><BR>I told him no, but that I was not about to drive back down the road in the dark. We hiked back to my van which was completely concealed in the brush until you reached the road. It was dusk when I drove out of the Reservation. <BR><BR>After a week of heavy storms had eased up, I sought out my Indian escort. Unlike before, he was neither friendly nor talkative. Briefly I was then told, \"My people are complaining. Our tribal spokesman is very displeased. You will not be welcome to return, with or without your friends - and <BR>trespassers risk being shot.\" So, I backed down for awhile - but I was not \"out.\"<BR><BR>For three months I planned for a return trip. A friend obtained permission from a well-known Indian to drive up the mountain just to take pictures, to stay on the road and not to wander around the reservation. I had studied the map well but a certain hunch compelled me to request we reverse our direction. After a steep turn, we were blocked - but good - by a heavy pick-up in the road next to a parked bulldozer. In front stood five Indians - shoulder to shoulder, spanning the road, with their backs to us.<BR><BR>\"Looks like we''ve got trouble,\" my escort said, very quietly. He stepped out with a cheery greeting and, as a Forest Service firefighter, was recognized. Two men approached me. \"You see Bigfoot this morning?\" They knew who I was. \"No, and I came up here just to shake hands with him.\" That brought welcomed laughter, then a statement, \"I have seen him. He comes up from the canyon below the flat you just passed. He doesn''t come out very often.\" <BR><BR>This confirmed what my first Indian guide had told me. The \"sticky\" situation was smoothed out but not to the extent that we could continue to explore.

Doug Huse, San Diego County Sheriffs Department<BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Okay, just go ahead and tell me about yourself, when you started working there and so on. <BR><BR>HUSE: I started working the Alpine area (east of San Diego, California) in March of 1970. I came to the department the previous year. I was working out there in a patrol capacity for the San Diego County Sheriff''s Department I was a deputy at the time and actually worked Alpine for about 2 years, from March of 1970 to April of 1972. As far as trying to recall exactly when this went down, the best I can come up with is that it was after the Laguna fire of 1970 ... September of 1970. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: The Laguna fire affected which areas?<BR><BR>HUSE: Well, it was the largest brush fire at the time in California history, and burned specifically in the Sweetwater River area from east of Alpine all the way south and west, probably another 15 miles. It was quite an extensive burn and through the area in question, Alpine, on the south side of Interstate 8. To recall the chain of events, it was extremely cold which means the time of year would''ve been sometime after September of 1970, probably December or January, maybe February...let''s see, that would be 1971 ... well, it was definitely winter. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Was that about the time of your first contact with the key witness, Dr. Baddour (prominent San Diego psychiatrist)? <BR><BR>HUSE: Yes, and I don''t recall the reason, but Dr. Baddour was stopped by a two-man patrol unit. Baddour was traveling eastbound, which would''ve been from the San Diego area to what we learned later was his home in Alpine. On the front seat of his car, I don''t remember what kind of car it was, he had a loaded .44 magnum revolver with a 6-inch barrel. That''s the same type of gun that Dirty Harry made famous. It''s the largest caliber hand gun you can buy. Of course this piqued our interest a little bit. I wasn''t the contact, I was what we call the cover during this particular stop. My partner''s the one who made first contact and found the gun. He secured the revolver and was asking the doctor, who''d identified himself as Dr. Baddour, why he was carrying the weapon. Baddour said it was because of a ... and I don''t know what he actually said at the time, but my partner heard him say, \"Zoobie,\" ... and so from there on all our conversations throughout the department referred to whatever Dr. Baddour had seen as a Zoobie. That wasn''t what the doctor actually called it, I don''t believe, but that''s what my partner heard and that''s how the name got coined.<BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: At the time did Dr. Baddour describe this Zoobie to the officer? <BR><BR>HUSE: Yes, he did, to both of us as a matter of fact. He described the Zoobie as a large, upright, walking hairy creature. Dr. Baddour convinced us and later other members of my department, including one of my patrol sergeants, that in truth he''d had three separate encounters with the Zoobies. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Did Dr. Baddour say how many of these Zoobies there were and where the sightings happened? <BR><BR>HUSE: Yeah, one sighting was made by his entire family within the confines of his yard and immediate area, and at one time they saw three Zoobies. What Dr. Baddour described to us was what he assumed was a father, mother and child with the largest of the Zoobies being over 6 feet tall, maybe 7 feet tall. The tallest was very hairy and much larger-framed than an ordinary man. What he described as the mother was about 5 feet tall, and the smaller one was about 3 or 4 feet tall. Like I said, the doctor convinced a number of us that he''d in fact seen something unusual. What happened then was that we did get involved in an investigation of the sightings. I did because of the shift I worked which was either 10 p.m. at night to 6 a.m., or what we called the evening or overlap shift which was from 6 p.m. to 2:30 in the morning. Neither of those shifts was conducive to interviewing citizens in the area, so I wasn''t able to locate other witnesses, and I can''t recall if I ever talked, to a deputy who canvassed the area looking for witnesses. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: How many people lived in the area at the time? <BR><BR>HUSE: There were very few homes, probably 5 or no more than 6 residences, and Baddour''s was the last home on the narrow road. Going back in my memory 20 years now, I''d say his house was a quarter to a third of a mile off the main road used to get to his place, almost in a straight line due south of Alpine Blvd. That area hasn''t grown much since then, no planned residential development in there. At that time the Baddour family themselves consisted of the doctor, his wife, a daughter and a son. The daughter was 17 and the son was younger, maybe 13 or 14. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Can you describe what the terrain looks like, is it actually alpine forest, etc.?<BR><BR>HUSE: It''s not a forest by any means, the elevation''s no more than 2300 feet. The road goes east and up, and in about another 20 miles it eventually climbs to about 5000 feet. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Does it continue up into forested areas? <BR><BR>HUSE: Yes it does and it follows the Sweetwater River it''s about 10 miles. The Sweetwater River isn''t much of a flowing river. It runs about three-quarters of a mile south of Dr. Baddour''s place. Of course it always depended on rainfall, but the river hasn''t run continuously anytime in the 20 years I''ve been familiar with the area. There''s no snowfall at all. The terrain itself is quite steep behind Dr. Baddour''s property, going down into the (Sweetwater) river bottom itself. It''s all primarily brush and chaparral.<BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Any bears in the area? <BR><BR>HUSE: I don''t think I''ve ever heard of a bear sighting in San Diego county, and again I''ve been in the area almost 23 years. We have deer everywhere here along with coyotes and fox and other types of wildlife, but no bears. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: What else do you remember about Dr. Baddour''s sightings? <BR><BR>HUSE: Let''s see, the first set of circumstances I remember was Dr. Baddour finding damage to the house when he''d just moved in. He said he bought the house from an older German couple and all of the light bulbs, inside and out, were the yellow bug repellent type. Baddour said the German man told me that he shouldn''t change them to white, that he should get used to the yellow light.<BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Because of an insect problem? <BR><BR>HUSE: Baddour said the German was very evasive about that, evasive also about a lot of details regarding the house and property. The property did have some acreage, I don''t recall the size but it was larger than a city lot anyway. The property had some fruit trees in the front and back yards. I don''t remember what kind of fruit trees they were, but the house and trees were surrounded by a fence. One of Baddour''s complaints was that fruit was being picked off the trees at the tops, but not from the bottoms. The trees were upward of 7 or 8 feet high, or maybe 10 feet high. Anyway, the fruit was disappearing from the tops of his trees and his fence was getting knocked down. He had a wind chime at one of the doors made of brass or some kind of strong metal which frequently rang in the blowing wind, and at one point the wind chime suddenly turned up flattened. Baddour couldn''t explain it and we couldn''t duplicate it. It was smashed. Baddour did make a plaster cast of a footprint and I know we had photographs of it, if we didn''t in fact have a plaster cast of the print ourselves. But I do recall there was a plaster cast. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Do you remember the approximate size of the footprint? <BR><BR>HUSE: I''m 6-foot-3 and I wear a size 12 shoe, and I''d have to say this one was larger than my shoe and much wider than my foot. I''d say it was about 13 or 14 inches in length, and I''ve been wracking my brain trying to remember if it had 4 toes or 5 toes, but I just can''t recall.** <BR><BR>[**According to researcher, Ken Coon, who visited the Alpine area in 1971, Dr. Baddour''s \"Zoobies\" left V -shaped, 4-toed footprints, 16 inches long and 8 inches wide with the widest measurement across the toes. The foot narrowed down to 5 inches at the heel.]<BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: But there''s some recollection that it might have had an usual number of toes? <BR><BR>HUSE: Yes, I do seem to remember that, but I can''t bring it to mind. I know the footprint was wide overall, and less wide at the heel, but the heel was still wider than a human foot would be. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Did you or any of the officers talk to the doctor''s wife or kids?<BR><BR>HUSE: Specifically the word came back to me, and I''m not sure which deputy found out, but the daughter said she had a sighting in the early morning hours as she boarded a school bus at Alpine Blvd. That would have been adjacent to the access road leading to the Baddour house. She was getting on the bus and spotted the creature off in the brush. There''s some very thick, very tall brush along the road there. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Do you remember any details of what she saw? <BR><BR>HUSE: No, not really, the man who was deeply involved in this was my patrol sergeant and he''s now deceased. He was so involved with it that on his days off he''d go up there and camp to the rear of Baddour''s house. He''d take his older son along and the two of them would camp out in hope of getting a glimpse of one of the Zoobies. They never did. But he was the man who probably had more conversations with the doctor than any-body else. Another sighting involved three Zoobies sighted by a whole family. The Baddours had made it a habit to never go out after dark, but one night they were out with the son to call in their pet dog. In the dark the boy thought he saw the dog near a comer of the house and called out to It. Well, the dog came running back, but from a different corner, and what at first they thought was the dog turned out to be the smaller Zoobie. Apparently it had been laying down and it got up and stood and walked the opposite way, joining the other two, the larger male and female, and they all walked off into the brush.<BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Did they ever use words like \"ape\" or \"gorilla\" to describe the creatures? <BR><BR>HUSE: No, they never did. Baddour was firm in his own mind that it wasn''t an ape or gorilla. It was something totally different than one of those. Well, for lack of anything better we thought it to be more like the California Bigfoot, based on how it was described. Whether it was black or brown I really can''t remember.<BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Did Dr. Baddour ever use the word Bigfoot or Sasquatch to describe the Zoobie? <BR><BR>HUSE: Not to me, no. As a matter of fact we were assigned to make periodic checks of his residence throughout the night because most of the damage to his property was done during the night time, so my partner and I in a two-man car would drive up there and shine the spotlight around his house. Dr. Baddour was very convincing. I can still picture him coming outdoors one night dressed in his skivvies and wearing black high top military boots. That was it, a tee-shirt and shorts with those black boots and carrying that big .44 magnum. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: How would you characterize the family, it sounds as though they were all educated, credible people? <BR><BR>HUSE: Yes, I''d characterize them as exactly that. I got the impression the daughter was very intelligent, and of course Baddour himself was a medical doctor, a psychiatrist. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: In our earlier phone call to arrange this interview you mentioned something about the creatures, the Zoobies, mimicking human speech ... ?<BR><BR>HUSE: Yes, one of the lighter stories I recall happened when the doctor got home after dark one night. They had chickens there, and earlier he''d called his wife to say he was going to be late and to remind her to feed the chickens before night fall, which she did. When the doctor got home he had to exit his car, open the gate, drove through and stopped, then got out of the car again to close the gate behind him. He said that when he went to close the gate that night he heard a very low, very guttural voice say, ''Here chicky, chicky, chicky...'' <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: That''s funny and not unprecedented in the research. Are you saying the impression was that one of the creature''s was imitating the doctors wife who''d called in the chickens earlier?<BR><BR>HUSE: Exactly. It was the doctor''s opinion, and we had no reason to doubt him, that the Zoobie had some type of intelligence and the capability of producing sounds like that. <BR><BR>MONEYMAKER: Did they ever describe any other sounds or smells, anything like that? <BR><BR>HUSE: Smells, yes. A very pungent odor, maybe like rotting garbage. You know, he did tell us he''d set up cameras around the house with trip-wires, but he wasn''t able to get any photographs, at least not while I was working the area. I really can''t recall but I know the doctor himself had a close sighting of one of the Zoobies, and there were probably other sightings, but I can''t remember now. Of course I worked up there for just those two years, until April of 1972. After that I went to fly helicopters. So I was completely out of touch with what was happening in Alpine, and I didn''t get back there until 1981. At that time I was stationed east of the Baddour home, and I didn''t hear anything more. I did hear something about the Proctor Valley Monster when I started patrol in 1970, which if true I''d have to assume was on the order of what Dr. Baddour was describing. Now, a few years ago a deputy told me he saw a dark-colored, large, upright furry creature, not a bear and not human, up in some rocks north of Interstate 8, and possibly northwest of El Capitan (reservoir). The deputy told me it was a good distance away. Also, I was involved in a juvenile diversion camp (near Julian, northeast of Alpine), and a couple of counselors from another camp came down and told us they''d see something they couldn''t identify in the mountains. After talking with them it was concluded that what they''d seen was probably a Zoobie. Another thing we found out, during our investigation of Dr. Baddour''s sightings, was that the Viejas Indians (reservation) just north of Interstate 8 had a legend about a giant hairy man that was the protector of their burial grounds, and those burial grounds were located just about 2 miles north of where Dr. Baddour lived.", :environment nil, :fixed_year "1970", :run_time "2022-05-20 16:15:24.000000"} {:nearestroad "Pacific coast highway", :date nil, :locationdetails "I only know we were up in some small mountains or large hills(whatever you want to call them).

We heard something coming up the side of the mountain. We could hear rocks rolling down the mountain. It came up over the edge and the Marine with me yelled halt. It stood up right in front of us about 6 feet away. I could see the outline of this creature and it was hugh. It looked about 3 1/2 feet wide. It had long arms and a pointed head. It was very tall.

First I must say that I don''t think a bigfoot lives real close to where I live but I do think we live within it''s (plural) normal range or migration route. <BR><BR>The first sighting was in 1998 in the winter, we are not really sure...  My brother was driving home and was on our private driveway when he drove by something that he could not describe.  He walked in andsaid he had just saw a bear or a big black person wearing animal fur, or a cow...  Basically his mind could not fit what he saw into any specific category  and he was very confused.  Upon questioning him he said it looked like a homeless person wearing animal skins.  He said they passed right by eachother going in opposite directions.  Since our road is a graveled one lane road they must have been within a couple of feet from eachother! He told me it had just happened so we went to investigate.  I was thinking there was a homeless person passing through... But then we turned a corner and I saw the footprint from about 50ft away!  I was so amazed that I stopped my truck and got out and immediately took off my shoe and sock to compare sizes...  I was not thinking about a bigfoot, it didn''t really cross my mind until a couple of years later actually...  I was still thinking it was a homeless person with huge barefeet!  I''m a size 12, I put my foot inside this track...  It was 4-6 inches longer and 3-4 inches wider than my foot.  And it was sunk into a hard pack dirt road about an inch or more.  Being 200lbs myself, I jumped around trying to make an impression an inch deep in this strata but to no avail.  I couldn''t sink my own track at all! I mean no inches, nada!  So now I was thinking about a homeless person wearing animal skins with huge feet and that was significantly heavier than me...  But there were two problems to this obvious bigfoot sighting (in hindsight)... Number one, bigfoot do not live so far south in California (or so I thought), and my brother did not come in and say, \"I just saw a bigfoot!\"  So it never occurred to either of us that this was a bigfoot sighting!!!  It wasn''t until a couple of years later that I asked him if what he saw could have been a bigfoot and he said,\" oh yeah, that makes sense now...\"  It took us awhile to put 2 and 2 together but we finally did with the help of this website.  I found it while web surfing and his sighting started to make sense...  Then I became more aware of my surroundings in relation to bigfoot.  We live in a typical second growth redwood forest with all the typical animals that I see quite often.  But I was never looking for bigfoot until now.  <BR>2004 was an exciting year.  We had 2 more sightings and a very loud vocal performance!  So, I was watching tv outside in the covered porch/ gazebo.  If you turn down the tv you can hear all of the night sounds as if you were outside.  Around 11:30ish pm  I heard something so I turned the tv off.  I then heard a very loud screaming roar right in front of my house.  And judging from the location of the first sound I heard that was distorted by the tv, I deduced that whatever this was was walking down my driveway and was very close!  It roared twice more while following the road.  I was dumbfounded!!!  And then I got scared... I''ve lived in the woods my whole life and think nothing of walking around in the dark with out a flashlight.  You couldn''t have dragged me outside at this point!  I''m 6''3, 220lbs, and this thing sounded huge. I compare the roar to the decibel level of a siren!  It just echoed off the hills.  I have compared it to the recordings on this sight and it is very close to the Washington recordings, especially the one from 2005.  I am so glad that my dad and mom both heard this!  It just gave you the impression that it had huge lungs to make such a loud noise!  But interestingly enough the last roar was ended with two very clear dog barks that I presume were mimicked...  All of the dogs in the vicinty were going crazy except the dogs that were the closest to where this thing had traveled...  <BR>Two nights later was the second sighting.  This time it was in the front yard of my Dads house.  I was leaving in my Suburban.  I was just edging down the driveway when I got something out of the corner of my eye.  I turned and looked at what appeared to be a large pile of redwood bark lying in the yard as if my dad had cut down one of his trees and had raked all the bark into a pile.  Redwood bark is reddish...  As I passed slowly by I realized that my dad had not cut down any of his trees and that there would be no reason for a large pile of redwood bark to be piled there.  What I have deduced is that a bigfoot was balled up hiding from me!  And it semi worked.  There was a fence between us and if I were in a smaller car I wouldn''t have seen it, but I was very high up in a raised Suburban so I could see over the fence.  It looked as if it was on it''s knees hunched over with its head on the ground and it''s arms over it head.  I say semi worked because I kept driving and didn''t realize what I had seen until a couple of minutes later.  When I went back my pile of redwood bark had disapeared.  I was so disapointed because I was only about 15 ft away! The next sighting I again missed out by seconds!  My wife and I were driving on our driveway and she said she had just I contact with someone...  I had driven about 30 more ft and stopped. I asked her and she said she saw a dark face with deep inset eyes and a shaggy head looking at her from behind a tree.  The windows of the car were still dewed up from the cold morning so I backed up and got out.  I heard bi pedal footsteps walking away through the oak leaves.  It was a very definitive sound...  I would have followed if I was not in business clothes...<BR>So I think a bigfoot or more lives in the area.  There are 60-70,000 acres near by and I believe we are in a corner of their range that they visit every once in awhile since the occurances are not everyday.

I want to say it was in the early fall of 1980, because my kids were very young. My husband and I were driving up Hecker Pass from Watsonville, on our way to Mt Madonna to meet relatives for what I want to say was a dinner or dinner event. it seems so long ago. It happened very fast, but what I saw looked covered in brown hair from head to toe and was huge, walking just like a man. It scared me to death!

I was 17 at the time, and would regularly take time off from high school with my parents permission to go on camping trips as long as I kept my grades up.  I do not remember the exact date''s as it has been nearly 26 years since the trip. <BR><BR>My friend and his brother had camped at the area the previous year in the Trinity Alps.  We departed from our homes in Whittier and Pico Rivera, Ca. in a newer model popup camper Volkswagen bus driven by one brother, and a ''69 VW bus driven by the other brother.  Since I was not driving I do not recall the highways or road to the campground that we took, and I no longer have contact with my friend and his family. I remember it took around 10 hours to get there.  We had to turn off the main highway on to a dirt road that we had to drive approximately 10 to 15 miles in order to reach the campground.  On the way to the campground on the dirt road there was patches of snow on the ground but the road was very drivable.  <BR><BR>About 8 miles on the dirt road we saw an older model VW Beetle coming towards us and we flagged it down, so we could ask the driver what the conditions were like at the campground.  The driver was alone and appeared to be in his mid to late 20s.  He had long hair and a beard and he appeared to be very nervous and distracted when he spoke to us.  He said, \"that the fishing was good along the river\" and thats about all I remember him saying besides \"good luck and for us to be careful\" before driving off.  The whole conversation only took about 2 minutes.  We continued on towards the campground and I remember us kidding to each other how weird the guy had acted as if something had frightened him. <BR><BR> When we got to the camp area we saw that there was no other campers around and no sign of any recent visitors.  We set up camp by parking the ''69 VW parallel to the river about 25 feet from the bank that led to the river and by parking the other bus the other way about 20 feet away from the ''69 bus with the fire ring between the two vehicles.  The popup VW was parked with it''s rear bumper facing the base of a long hill and the front facing the river about 45 feet from the river.  The campground was in a very remote and densely forested area nestled between large mountains in every direction.  <BR><BR>We set up camp and decided to go for a hike.  We hiked about five miles into a very primitive area along a trail that was hard to follow in some areas.  After awhile we came upon an old cabin.  The cabin appeared to be abandoned for some time by the shape it was in.  One of the brothers was able to get the door open and we all went inside.  There was a few old cans of food, an old rusted shotgun, old blankets, and an old gas lantern.  There were rodent droppings throughout the cabin, and we figured that it possibly was used by seasonal hunters.  We closed up the cabin, and continued our hike.  It was getting late so we decided to sleep under the stars that night instead of hiking back to the campground in the dark. I remember that it was one of the coldest nights I had ever been through as my frozen boots that I had left outside of my tent attested to in the morning.  <BR><BR>We hiked back to our camp the next morning, and prepared breakfast, and just kind of relaxed all day.  Later in the afternoon we took our guns out, and had target practice on some tin cans.  At night we made a huge fire in the pit, listened to music on the tape deck and talked about the day.  We all headed for bed around 9:30 or 10:00 that night. The cousin and I slept up in the canvas pop-top of the bus, while my friend and the older of his two brothers slept below on the foldout bed.  The other brother slept with his dog in the other bus. <BR><BR> Around 10:30 I remember I was almost asleep when I heard a noise coming from far above on the hill next to us.  I then heard something moving at a high rate of speed coming down the hill towards us.  Suddenly the whole bus started rocking back and forth from side to side and at one point I thought it was going to tip over.  I remember hanging on tight and then worrying that if the bus did roll over that I may be crushed if the popup collapsed so I dove for the floor of the bus, and a second later the cousin landed on top of me.  The bus stopped rocking suddenly and I remember hearing over our screams a lot of noise just outside of our vehicle.  We then heard yelling coming from the other brother in his bus and his dog barking like crazy.  We tried looking out the windshield and the side windows but it was iced up and fogged up from the cold.  In a second it was dead quiet again.  We rolled down the passenger side window and called out to the other brother if he was ok.  He said that he was and we all slowly got out of the buses.  The brother in our bus had grabbed his 44 Magnum, and led the way out.  The first thing I noticed was that all of our backpacks had been flung about the camp and that my pack and the cousins pack had been torn open and the contents of our packs was strewn everywhere.  We left everything where it was, and we all crammed into the popup bus for the rest of the night.  Needless to say we barely slept that night. <BR><BR> The next morning we cleaned up the mess outside, and speculated on what could have attacked us. The whole attack lasted only a few minutes.  We ruled out a bear because there were no bear tracks. And a bear would have still been in the area.  I climbed the hill behind our bus that I heard whatever it was that had come after us, and I noticed long skid marks that started higher than I could climb, but I saw no footprints.  I tried to match the stride of the skid marks coming down the hill but couldn''t because of the steepness of the hill and the space between the skid marks. We went on with our day by preparing and eating breakfast, and later going for a short hike, and again shooting our guns at targets.  I think that we were all a little edgy after the attack, and I know I kept looking around and over my shoulder whenever possible. <BR><BR> Later that night we again sat around the campfire, and listened to music, and talked.  And again we went to bed around the same time.  We kept the same sleeping arrangements and I remember being jumpy at every little sound that I heard outside.  Once again I remember that I was almost asleep when again I heard a noise coming from high above us.  I then heard something rolling down the hill towards us, and the back of our bus being hit by some large object.  I remember all of us saying something like \"oh no, not again\".  I then heard the same sounds as the night before coming fast at us from the hill.  This time I didn''t wait, and I dove for the floor, and again the cousin landed on top of me.  And once again the bus started to rock violently from side to side for about 30 seconds.  My friends brother had kept his 44 near him, and he was waving it around at the windows, and I remember thinking that one of us may get shot by accident.  When the shaking stopped we again heard the other brother yelling from his bus and his dog going nuts.   We tried to see through the iced over windows again with no success.  We exited our bus as soon as we were sure the attacks were over, and called out to the other brother who said he was ok.  I remember the strong smell of something for a short while.  With our flashlights beaming we conducted a brief search of the immediate area.  <BR><BR>This time our packs were undisturbed.  We walked to the back of our bus, and there was a large rock about 3 feet in diameter wedged between the rear bumper, and the back tire on the drivers side.  One side of the rock had a very pointed edge to it, and it was inches from the tire.  Whatever had attacked us had thrown the boulder down first before it began its attack on us.  We then noticed that the other bus that the brother was in, which was the closest to the river, had been either pushed or dragged about 5 feet towards the river.  Whatever had attacked us had been very fast and extremely strong, to have attacked so quickly, and to have moved a whole VW bus by itself.  Again I don''t remember getting much sleep that night, and the next morning we cut our trip short by packing everything up, and getting the hell out of there.<BR><BR>  Ironically the first campground that we came to was the Bigfoot RV Park not far down the main highway if that helps with the location at all. We stayed there for the night and used the showers to clean up, and we slept for 12 hours straight as I recall before leaving for home the next day. I remember not having to drive too far to where there was a statue of Bigfoot in a town called Red Bluff or something like that on the way home. <BR><BR> I am 43 years old now, and I have only told this story to a few people including my wife and three kids.  My friends and I never really talked about it when we got back from our trip only because it was so surreal, and I personally thought that people would think that I made it up, or I was insane or something.  I remember for a long time after the trip that I would still get the chills if I was home alone, and I would think about the attacks.  To this day I really don''t have any idea what it was up there.  I have thought about everything that it could have been including that crazy looking guy we met on our way to the campground but it would have been impossible for him to match the strength and quickness that I witnessed those two nights.  I don''t believe in supernatural forces, monsters, aliens, and creatures that have never been discovered. <BR><BR> I consider myself an intelligent man, and a reasonable person.  I see enough in the real world as a peace officer to believe in fairytales.  I am only writing about my adventure because I saw the article on bigfoot on AOL, and decided to check out the web site.  I thought it would be fun to share my incident with you.  To this day I am not saying that we were attacked by a bigfoot, because we never saw anything to support that claim.  I am only saying what I am saying, and that we were attacked twice by some unknown man or animal, with enormous quickness, stealth and strength. <BR><BR>The next year my friend went back to the same campground with his brother and another friend, and no further incidences occurred. I am open to any reasonable explanation, but I don''t lose any sleep over this after all these years.  I just thought this would interest you.     <BR>", :environment "Huge mountains, dense forest, rugged landscape, and a river about 40 ft. across, about 15 miles from the nearest highway.", :fixed_year "1977", :run_time "2022-05-20 16:15:56.000000"} {:nearestroad "Olive Springs Rd.", :date nil, :locationdetails "This is near the epicenter of the ''89 Earthquake.

I always love to scan the ridges looking for shapes like you do when you hunt.  I came around a big  turn in the main channel and it was the most bizarre thing I had ever seen. About 20 feet from shore I see what I initially believed to be a big hairy head with eyes staring directly at me. I would say within a couple seconds it simply disappeared under the surface of the water. I was wearing sunglasses and I remember thinking  did I just see what I think I did?  I gave it a wide girth and slowed down and circled the area for about 2-3 minutes. I remember feeling freaked out a bit having this vision of it lunging out of the water at me.  Shortly after I continued back to Jones Valley resort and tried to put it out of my head. I wish now more than ever I would have taken the time to search for it but I just figured my initial thought had to be incorrect. I reasoned naturally it had to be something else. A beaver? Muskrat? I can''t say for sure what it was but I know it was big. I do know my original feeling was it was a big hairy head and face with eyes.

Since I did not want to travel south again to Redding we decided on highway 96 to Yreka, and I-5 as a shortcut. <BR><BR>My youngest daughter was with me, and we had driven a long ways and so we gassed up in Willow Creek and decided to continue to drive. It was late and it was a boring uneventful dark drive up this \"Bigfoot Highway 96, but finally we crossed a bridge on the Klamath River and got to a campground where we finally saw trailers and trucks and people type stuff. The road then goes up a switchback to a ridge for a mile or so, and I slowed my speed down to 25 mph. <BR><BR>So, as I got to the ridge, maybe a couple miles from the bridge, I came around this last switchback, and to the right my headlights swept the left embankment and I thought there was a bear coming down the embankment towards the highway. I slowly crept ahead and began to stop as this bear was shuffling down this embankment on two feet, but it was not a bear. I stopped completely and not over one hundred feet in front of me was this thing intent on getting across the road the road in front of me.<BR><BR>If I didn''t see it on the bank I probably would''ve hit it, because it was that close. It got to the center line in three long steps and looked at me and then jumped off the road.  I mean from the centerline on its right leg it jumped clear off the pavement and over a two foot embankment and was out of sight. <BR><BR>It was not overly tall probably just six feet or a little taller, but extremely was thick maybe in the 300 pound range this thing was built. It was hair not fur and matted and dark brown but with a rusty auburn tint to it. I was extremely close with high beams on, and stopped in the road. It had long arms like a gorilla or something, and it sort of lumbered forward like a gorilla only fast with definite long strides; it had something it was aiming for and when it looked at me it turned its head back straight and this thing jumped off the road like an elk on one leg. It had extremely thick legs and shoulders, and no man could make a jump like that. If I had a video camera in the dash of my car you would have seen the video of your life. I couldn''t make out any genitalia it was so hairy I would estimate its body hair like six inches long and matted and dangly, but not so much on its butt or the back of its legs. I could make out the thighs and they were some guns. <BR><BR>I was too scared to get out of my car to look over the embankment, that and my daughter was freaked out. Get the heck out of here. I took a picture of the hillside he came down. I can find the exact spot and in fact am on vacation this next week and I got an infrared camera and a motor drive dslr this time, and oh, I ain''t getting out of my car without my gun. Don''t get me wrong I aint a gun freak but I could have rammed this thing with my car the first time. I don''t want to hurt anything, but I don''t want to get my head ripped off by something just on the other side of the dark roadside either.<BR> <BR>This sighting was at 12:55 am and I was wide awake. I checked my odometer from where I saw him it was forty two miles to the next bridge on the river at a small town before I got to the freeway on 96. I am a recreational hunter in my younger years but this isn''t something you hunt; this is something you gawk at. Oh and as close as I was the eyes didn''t glow. I must have counted 60 deer along that road and I saw eyeballs everywhere in the road along side the road from that ridge to Yreka. This thing didn''t have glowing eyes, and I had the high beams on and watched it cross the road and look at me. It didn''t have animal eyes that glowed.

My son and I took a short vacation to my childhood memories trip area to French Gulch where I remembered an eerie thing that happened back in the mid 60''s with my father. I had lived with my grandparents in an small town called Summit City just a few miles below Shasta Lake Dam when my father one day took me to French Gulch way way back deep into the woods North and North East of the French Gulch town. <BR><BR>I remember always feeling as though being watched and sometimes herd really eerie sounds. I remember the eerie sound that made this worse for me to be comfortable. I was a naturalist though and always felt drawn to the deep woods and so it was hard to keep me from it. In latter years after retiring from the U.S. Army I took a trip visiting relatives in Redding, and one evening I packed up the truck for an deep adventure back to those woods and was their mostly to get those big pine cone''s with delicious pine nuts. <BR><BR>We left late that evening, getting their as it turned near dark and I felt my memories would help me find the places I had been as an teen with my dad and park and get some sleep and then wake up at some old cabin. It was as if I could practically reach out to the stars that clear bright night and (as well the moon was out partially) some of the ledges on those high peaks were a bit scary driving by them as it was so dark and far down I couldnt see how far. Then after about three hours of this turn and that and many miles I had forgot to count, and my son fell asleep; I became tired and stopped. <BR><BR>I turned off the truck engine and left the headlights on as I saw so many pine cones about an foot or longer and I began to load a few up. I had a camper shell on the little Plymouth arrow Pickup and could lock ourselves in for the night when time came. <BR><BR>Before I stopped, I just happened to turn the truck around on the road as it made it easier to load some of the pine cones and as I got out beginning to loading more pine cones, that is when I heard that noise and it was very close. I was petrified at the sound as it is nothing like the elk calls that sound a bit eerie too. I began to slowly pick up a few more pine cones as these were only for decorating for our Christmas seasons and as in my childhood days, I would get the green ones that made it from last autumn and were still on the pine trees as I was still the tree climber. I had reached down to pick up the fifth pine cone and it was then I just froze up and full of panicky fear. I could hear up the side of the ledge, ridge, to my right clearly a heavy pounding of what sounded like something very large. Only two distant sounds pounding the ground and the damn thing was coming fast. I dropped the pine cones at once and ran up to the drivers side fumbling in fear with the door trying to get in the truck. Then I started the truck up and was trying to put it into 1st gear and jammed it in just as I let out the clutch awaking my 7 year old son. I had heard the sound coming down behind the right rear of the truck just before I got the truck started. I happened to look back in the darkness behind the truck as it darted forward and in the dimness of the tail lights I seen this awful dark hairy figure standing upright behind the truck. The moon and the stars were out which helped me see this figure form as well. I had been stricken with such fear that I had never known before at this moment and nearly drove off the side of the road when my son said, Dad, watch out !!. I then nearly flipped the truck over, just missing a small log. I had no gun with me.  I would have not feared what this was, and would have shot in the air as a warning or at it if I had to. <BR><BR>It was that darn eerie sound and the sound of the thing coming down the steep hillside, and at that second the issue of absolute fear of not having any defense, that got my spirit stirred. I knew for sure it wasnt a bear, as that memory is still just as plain to see today. It took a while before my son got me to say what happened on the way back as I was barrowing down the mountain as fast as I could, and am surprised I didnt forget each turn I had to make on the roads I chose going out on the way back. <BR><BR>We just pulled into French Gulch when daylight was breaking and I had to stop and sleep for an hour or so when my son woke me up whining about being hungry.  I woke up a bit dazed and it came back to me what had happened and I started up the truck and headed back for Redding.  My son was teasing me, Oh dad it was probably just a bear.<BR><BR>We reached Uncle Bills place on the right side of the road well before Redding where he lived on some property of his brothers wifes Father; an Italian whom passed away. Still to this day my son teases me at his age 23. <BR><BR>I was a ranch care taker a few years back in Flagstaff, Arizona, and I had seen a lot of things and heard a lot of things, but nothing that could ever compare to what I experienced on that early morning above French Gulch, and I surely didnt want to.  I always carried a gun with me on that ranch just the south side of Rodgers Dry Lake even in the surrounding woods.<BR><BR>Their were signs posted before entering that forest North of French Gulch stating to keep out during the evening (Night) and cut firewood only during daylight hours.  I hadnt been their for so many years and wanted to experience what I remembered as an teen, but I sure wouldnt have if I had known what I would have encountered that night.<BR><BR>Im very serious, because I''ve studied the Sasquatch or Bigfoot ever since, and would go with someone else today and be a lot more prepared for such an venture, but never again alone like that night and without some serious protection. I have never herd of where this big beast has come up on some one like me and acting like it did, but it sure did with me.<BR><BR>I hope someone does get some physical evidence because I havent enjoyed being teased all these years; also we could put an end to the mystery of this beast. I''ve known what it was like to have big bears visit at night up in the high country of the Colorado Mountains, Rabbit Ear Mountain-Pass area, where I camped with wife and our first born.  Ive been around the world and seen a lot of things from the mountains in West Germany and in South Korea in the Ming Dung Mountains where the Siberian tiger still remained back in 1975. In all those years I have never had such a scare. My body and hands were trembling and I was scared down to the core of my being.<BR><BR>Sincerely, <BR><BR>Sgt. M.L.D.

I was 13 at the time and I had never heard of Bigfoot. The way our camp was laid out was that all of us girls (two sisters, their friends and a friend of mine) were all staying in one big army tent. My brother and his friend were in a smaller tent off to the east closer to the drop off to the lake. Then my parents were in their own tent at the far west end of the campsite. There had been a lot of trouble with bears that summer so all campers were advised to hang their food high up in the trees. My Dad did that and I remember him standing under the bag of food a good three feet over his head about 10 to 15 feet from the door to our tent to the left. My Dad was 5''10\".<BR><BR>As for myself, I really wanted to see a bear. I was a very outdoorsy kid and would have preferred to sleep outside of the tent actually. I had little fear of the dark, or the night, and it was my goal to see a bear. I am quit sure we were there for two weeks that year and as I remember it, my sighting occurred about a week in to being there ... since I spent several days after that looking for traces of what I had seen.<BR><BR>I slept closest to the door and somewhere during the middle of the night I heard a little stirring outside. Everyone else was asleep and I didn''t wake anyone since I had already been informed (emphatically) that no one else wanted to see a bear. I very quietly and carefully crawled to the door of the tent and cautiously stuck my head out the door. I looked over to where the food bag was hanging and saw something that was unquestionably NOT a bear. What I saw was two dark hairy creatures just standing there under the food bag like they were negotiating how to get it down or something. One of them was a good foot taller than the other. My Dad would have come to the bottom of chest of the biggest one. They were just huge! The smaller one was probably just a head taller than my dad. I had that as a gauge after all since I had seen my Dad standing there in the very same spot under the bag, and he hung the food bag in the same place every night. They were VERY tall and very upright.<BR><BR>I had never heard of a Bigfoot at that time, but I knew these were not bears. Bears are pear shaped and standing upright isn''t a position of comfort for them. For that matter, they don''t just ''stand'' next to each other like they are carrying on a conversation. The incident took place very quickly. It was fast, but I was VERY impressed and it was clear to me immediately that I was seeing something extraordinary.<BR><BR>What happened was that as I saw them, and saw that they were something unexpected, I did one of those surprised intakes of breath ... a true ''gasp'' I guess you could say. They heard that and both turned and looked at me. Then, they turned and looked at each other, looked back at me again, and then ... they were just gone. They made not a sound. One moment they were there, and then they were not. I did not go out of the tent. I did think about it, but ... I laid awake all that night thinking about it. I had absolutely no idea what I had seen.<BR><BR>The next morning the first thing I did was go out in the direction I saw them leave to see if I could find tracks, but the earth was very hard and dry there. I didn''t see anything. It might be that someone more skilled than I was at the time might have found some trace, but I didn''t. I did spend a goodly amount of the remainder of that vacation watching and walking in the woods. I recall I even passed on water skiing a few times to go search the woods.<BR><BR>I didn''t tell anyone what I saw until a few years later. I told NO ONE at the time. I was the youngest in my family and already endured a considerable amount of teasing on a regular basis ... you know, kid stuff. I was not about to tell anyone I saw a 7 foot (or so) tall hairy man creature in the campsite. It would not have gone well.<BR><BR>Oh, what I saw of them ... Hairy, with long hanging brown to black hair. I didn''t catch any gender features. I just assumed the smaller one was female, but I have no reason to think that since I was mostly just seeing their height ... and the fact that they looked at me ... they LOOKED at me. Uh ... there just aren''t words. I did catch that the arms were quite long and they were very big in the chest, shoulders and upper arms, not so much in the hips.  Nope these were not bears at all. I do not recall if there was any strong scent associated with my sighting. <BR><BR>I didn''t know what I saw until a year or so later when I saw a picture of the famous movie footage.

In hindsight I remember how odd it was for it to be that quiet on a Saturday night on Lake Shasta. Not even insects were making any noise.I had been sitting in front of a small, almost-out fire for some time when I heard a large tree branch break about 50 yards away. It was sort of an instant ''pop'' sound and the branch never hit the ground. Initially it startled me but after about 10 minutes I had just written it off as one of the normal noises that the woods make at night. Then I heard another branch break in the same fashion maybe 10-15 yards from where the first had been broken, again never hitting the ground. Within a minute or two I heard approximately 10 to 13 VERY heavy footsteps heading more or less in my direction.

Then came a sort of rainy cloudy day in March of 2001, I think, when I was on the mountain by myself. At Lake Shasta Caverns we had tours leaving 3 times a day and it was the last one that day. From way up on top of the mountain you couldn''t see much beyond you and I''d say the visiblity was 300 yards or less. My tour arrived and turned out to only be two people, a male and female. The bus driver turned the bus around and returned to the bottom of the hill. As the three of us were standing there we were looking out across the ravine talking quietly when we heard some rustling and distinct thumps on the ground. They asked me what it was and I just kept watching thearea it was comming from. As we were looking up and down the ravine 200yrds away, a never before noticed, but clearly viewable, skid path was spotted by the man on my tour. He had a high pwered scope type camera and zoomed in. All the while we were still waiting to see what was moving down the ravine at such a high speed and moving the tops of what I thought to be pretty large trees on this path. And out of the overgrowth we saw it. Huge, on two feet arms clearly swinging wide in front of it and behind it. In a matter of 2 seconds or so it was no longer visible but we could still hear it. The thumping was it''s feet running down hill to the water of the lake, straight down. The echo continued until suddenly a silence. I turned to the man and asked if he got it. He said,\" I don''t know, I think so.\" I then immediatly ran for the emergency radio we keep in the storage/employee room and called down to the bus at the bottom.

The surrounding that area was old growth pine trees. I looked over at the old growth area and there stood Big Foot. He was about 5'' tall, and hairy all over.

The moon was out and we noticed some movement in the clearing. The moon gave off just enough light that we saw a figure move slowly across the clearing. Lucky, my partner, thought it might be a bear, so we didn''t pay it much mind.<BR><BR>I guess about 10 or fifteen minutes passed, when all of a sudden we heard dry brush breaking up on the side of the mountain. From where the camp is located we were on the east side of the mountain. From that point the mountain goes straight up. Lots of brush and timber. Suddenly, whatever it was started screaming and we could hear it crashing through the brush. It scared the hell out of us.<BR><BR>Then it must have turned and headed uphill. It was still screaming but it sounded like it was getting further away. We were both too shook-up to move, so we just sat there not saying a word. I guess about 20 minutes passed without hearing anything, then all of a sudden we heard a log come flying down the mountain crashing through the brush.<BR><BR>Then it started again: this time the screaming was louder and seemed to be closer. The wind was coming from the north, which was where the spring was. All of a sudden it smelled like something had died. It smelled like a strong urine odor. The smell was overwhelming; it was like somebody had opened an outhouse door or something. And the screaming was louder than ever.<BR><BR>Then all of a sudden it went quiet. We stayed up another hour or so before we decided to turn in for the night. We put some more wood on the fire and got in the tent and got ready to sleep. Then it started again. It lasted about ten minutes then went quiet, but then it really got scary. The light from the fire was pretty bright and showed through the tent. We were both hugging our deer rifles, wondering what would happen next.<BR><BR>All of a sudden we both saw a shadow come between the fire and the tent. It moved slowly and was very large. Then as quickly as it started it ended.<BR><BR>The next morning we searched the area for foot prints but were unable to find any. What we did realize was that our pickup was parked right near the spring and there was a very large log that had not been there the day before. We figured maybe whatever it was didn''t like the pickup so near to the only water in the area. It was a very dry year and all the natural springs in the area were dry, so this was the only water for miles.<BR><BR>I have hunted this area for the last 25 years and I have back-packed in the back country all my life. I have heard just about every animal that''s out there, but I have never heard anything like what we heard that night. So what do you think? Did we have an encounter with one of the big guys?

On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire.
