It was late afternoon when we noticed a strong odor that we thought might be elk so we headed east toward a small ridge hoping to find one on the other side.  As we got closer we heard the noise of rocks being banged together.  As we topped the ridge we saw a large dark brown animal squatting at the edge of a dry creek bed with it''s back toward us. It was banging 2 rocks together with it''s \"hands\" and making a grunting/growling noise each time the  rocks hit.<BR><BR>It seemed to sense our presence almost immediately and turned around and looked at us.  Then it quickly stood up and jumped across the creek in one motion.  I remember thinking \"nothing can move like that!\".  It ran up the slope on the north side of the creek bed at an angle and disappeared into the pine and aspen trees farther up the hill.  We could see it for about 50 feet before it was gone from sight.  It moved real quietly for something that big.<BR><BR>I estimate it''s height as 6''5''''.  It was covered with long dark brown hair that made me think of a yak.  It had a strong smell, at least there was a strong smell in the area that was like elk urine.<BR><BR>After we calmed down a bit, we went into the creek bed and found the 2 rocks which were chipped and broken.  We looked for other signs in that place but couldn''t find anything else." 1, " I was working in the northern part of New Mexico training to be a Wildland Fire Fighter. In September 2003 (maybe the second week of that month) I was dispatched with 22 other people to the Del Loma Fire in the Shasta/Trinity Forest area, the Northern part of California. Each Crew had about 20 people, our plane that left Albuquerque held 2 crews. For almost the whole two weeks, we were all on standby. On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire. It was close to sun down when, a couple of guys were amazed at something. I heard them from inside my tent, but just ignored the whole thing until one of my crew members came and pulled me out of my tent. <BR><BR>I had no idea what I was supposed to be looking at or for. He pointed across the river and I was in shock when he pointed out the biggest, hairiest mammal I had ever seen just walking along the river side minding his own business. It stopped and looked at us. The way he stood on his hind legs was like an ordinary human. He had dark, long hair and stood about 7ft tall with a muscular build. <BR><BR>At this point I was the 4th person standing there in amazement. Maybe about 5 minutes of watching him watch us, with more people coming out with flashlights (because the sun was still going down) he darted in to the trees. He was running, taking long strides, and was gone in about 3 seconds.....and was literally pushing trees out of his way (not breaking them, but  pushing them out of his way). The trees behind him on his path up the mountain were swaying back and forth.

It was late afternoon when we noticed a strong odor that we thought might be elk so we headed east toward a small ridge hoping to find one on the other side.  As we got closer we heard the noise of rocks being banged together.  As we topped the ridge we saw a large dark brown animal squatting at the edge of a dry creek bed with it''s back toward us. It was banging 2 rocks together with it''s \"hands\" and making a grunting/growling noise each time the  rocks hit.<BR><BR>It seemed to sense our presence almost immediately and turned around and looked at us.  Then it quickly stood up and jumped across the creek in one motion.  I remember thinking \"nothing can move like that!\".  It ran up the slope on the north side of the creek bed at an angle and disappeared into the pine and aspen trees farther up the hill.  We could see it for about 50 feet before it was gone from sight.  It moved real quietly for something that big.<BR><BR>I estimate it''s height as 6''5''''.  It was covered with long dark brown hair that made me think of a yak.  It had a strong smell, at least there was a strong smell in the area that was like elk urine.<BR><BR>After we calmed down a bit, we went into the creek bed and found the 2 rocks which were chipped and broken.  We looked for other signs in that place but couldn''t find anything else." 1, " I was working in the northern part of New Mexico training to be a Wildland Fire Fighter. In September 2003 (maybe the second week of that month) I was dispatched with 22 other people to the Del Loma Fire in the Shasta/Trinity Forest area, the Northern part of California. Each Crew had about 20 people, our plane that left Albuquerque held 2 crews. For almost the whole two weeks, we were all on standby. On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire. It was close to sun down when, a couple of guys were amazed at something. I heard them from inside my tent, but just ignored the whole thing until one of my crew members came and pulled me out of my tent. <BR><BR>I had no idea what I was supposed to be looking at or for. He pointed across the river and I was in shock when he pointed out the biggest, hairiest mammal I had ever seen just walking along the river side minding his own business. It stopped and looked at us. The way he stood on his hind legs was like an ordinary human. He had dark, long hair and stood about 7ft tall with a muscular build. <BR><BR>At this point I was the 4th person standing there in amazement. Maybe about 5 minutes of watching him watch us, with more people coming out with flashlights (because the sun was still going down) he darted in to the trees. He was running, taking long strides, and was gone in about 3 seconds.....and was literally pushing trees out of his way (not breaking them, but  pushing them out of his way). The trees behind him on his path up the mountain were swaying back and forth. I was surprised to see to these trees moving because they are thick in width and very tall. <BR><BR>By this time it was dark but lit enough to see which way he was headed. Up the mountain a little, there was a clearing, where we spotted him again before he disappeared for good. He made no noise, no yelling or screaming. He was just as timid as can be.<BR><BR>I have heard many stories about Bigfoot, and known that they are real but when seeing one in real life....you get a sense of respect for them and just have that feeling that there is more to life than you know. <BR><BR><BR><BR>" 1}, :cardinality 99}, :environment {:data-type "string", :distinct 449, :group-by?

It was late afternoon when we noticed a strong odor that we thought might be elk so we headed east toward a small ridge hoping to find one on the other side.  As we got closer we heard the noise of rocks being banged together.  As we topped the ridge we saw a large dark brown animal squatting at the edge of a dry creek bed with it''s back toward us. It was banging 2 rocks together with it''s \"hands\" and making a grunting/growling noise each time the  rocks hit.<BR><BR>It seemed to sense our presence almost immediately and turned around and looked at us.  Then it quickly stood up and jumped across the creek in one motion.  I remember thinking \"nothing can move like that!\".  It ran up the slope on the north side of the creek bed at an angle and disappeared into the pine and aspen trees farther up the hill.  We could see it for about 50 feet before it was gone from sight.  It moved real quietly for something that big.<BR><BR>I estimate it''s height as 6''5''''.  It was covered with long dark brown hair that made me think of a yak.  It had a strong smell, at least there was a strong smell in the area that was like elk urine.<BR><BR>After we calmed down a bit, we went into the creek bed and found the 2 rocks which were chipped and broken.  We looked for other signs in that place but couldn''t find anything else." 1, " I was working in the northern part of New Mexico training to be a Wildland Fire Fighter. In September 2003 (maybe the second week of that month) I was dispatched with 22 other people to the Del Loma Fire in the Shasta/Trinity Forest area, the Northern part of California. Each Crew had about 20 people, our plane that left Albuquerque held 2 crews. For almost the whole two weeks, we were all on standby. On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire. It was close to sun down when, a couple of guys were amazed at something. I heard them from inside my tent, but just ignored the whole thing until one of my crew members came and pulled me out of my tent. <BR><BR>I had no idea what I was supposed to be looking at or for. He pointed across the river and I was in shock when he pointed out the biggest, hairiest mammal I had ever seen just walking along the river side minding his own business. It stopped and looked at us. The way he stood on his hind legs was like an ordinary human. He had dark, long hair and stood about 7ft tall with a muscular build. <BR><BR>At this point I was the 4th person standing there in amazement. Maybe about 5 minutes of watching him watch us, with more people coming out with flashlights (because the sun was still going down) he darted in to the trees. He was running, taking long strides, and was gone in about 3 seconds.....and was literally pushing trees out of his way (not breaking them, but  pushing them out of his way). The trees behind him on his path up the mountain were swaying back and forth. I was surprised to see to these trees moving because they are thick in width and very tall. <BR><BR>By this time it was dark but lit enough to see which way he was headed. Up the mountain a little, there was a clearing, where we spotted him again before he disappeared for good. He made no noise, no yelling or screaming. He was just as timid as can be.<BR><BR>I have heard many stories about Bigfoot, and known that they are real but when seeing one in real life....you get a sense of respect for them and just have that feeling that there is more to life than you know. <BR><BR><BR><BR>" 1}, :cardinality 99}, :environment {:data-type "string", :distinct 468, :group-by? true, :commons {nil 32, "woods" 2, "Along the Saint John''s river, I believe there are wooded areas on both sides of the river.

<BR><BR>The location was in the area of Mono Hot Springs, in the Sierra Nevada''s in California, specifically, the John Muir Wilderness.  <BR><BR>My brother friend and I were fishing at Doris Lake near dusk.  Doris Lake is roughly a mile and a half hike from the resort of Mono.  Nothing unusual was happening and then out of nowhere, we heard a scream come from across the lake and up in the Mountians.  There were no people or animals that we could see anywhere.  We were in the proverbial wilderness.  My brother and I looked at each other, and unable to readily discern what we were hearing we continued to fish.  I did say to him, if I hear that again I am out of here. Well, a minute or so later, the same scream.  The three of us immediately reeled in and began to run all the way back to the resort, without stopping.  <BR><BR>I have listened to various recordings of alleged Bigfoot, and I am struck by how similar these recordings are to the scream that we heard.  I did not see anything, so I cant be sure, but I am fairly certian what I heard was not a human, bear or mountian lion.  So....what could it be?<BR><BR>Note:  my brother and sister worked for several years at Mono Hot Springs.  My sisters good friend who worked their as well had a horse which she kept in the summer time at the springs. While riding in the back country, she claims to have seen Bigfoot walking through a meadow below a bluff she was riding atop.

I didn''t sleep well that night.  I had a feeling I was being watched and was uneasy. Breaking camp the next morning, Van went for water coming from an artesian spring in the wall of the canyon.  He found one very clear bigfoot footprint in the wet sand below the spring, about 80 feet from where we''d camped.  He called to me to come over and see.  My first reaction was this was a hoax.  Van and I examined the footprint in detail.  It was about 17 inches in length, with 5 clear toes and pressed down about 2 1/2 inches in the sand.  There was a musty smell in the area but this wasn''t overpowering.  Van concluded the print was real based upon the fact it had rained hard the previous morning and you could see the pattern of the rain drops on the surface of the sand except where the footprint was.  Also whatever had the print may very well be slightly above us at the end of the bluff in some rock outcroppings.  He suggested we get out of there while the getting was good.  Van had grown up in Minnesota hunting and fishing with his dad and brothers.  I decided we should take his advice.  We left and back tracked to Van''s Toyota Landcruiser.  We went over to Bass lake to fish for the rest of the weekend.", :environment "This area is around 4500 to 5000 feet in altitude and is covered primarily with conifer forest with some very heavy underbrush in areas.

It was late afternoon when we noticed a strong odor that we thought might be elk so we headed east toward a small ridge hoping to find one on the other side.  As we got closer we heard the noise of rocks being banged together.  As we topped the ridge we saw a large dark brown animal squatting at the edge of a dry creek bed with it''s back toward us. It was banging 2 rocks together with it''s \"hands\" and making a grunting/growling noise each time the  rocks hit.<BR><BR>It seemed to sense our presence almost immediately and turned around and looked at us.  Then it quickly stood up and jumped across the creek in one motion.  I remember thinking \"nothing can move like that!\".  It ran up the slope on the north side of the creek bed at an angle and disappeared into the pine and aspen trees farther up the hill.  We could see it for about 50 feet before it was gone from sight.  It moved real quietly for something that big.<BR><BR>I estimate it''s height as 6''5''''.  It was covered with long dark brown hair that made me think of a yak.  It had a strong smell, at least there was a strong smell in the area that was like elk urine.<BR><BR>After we calmed down a bit, we went into the creek bed and found the 2 rocks which were chipped and broken.  We looked for other signs in that place but couldn''t find anything else." 1, " I was working in the northern part of New Mexico training to be a Wildland Fire Fighter. In September 2003 (maybe the second week of that month) I was dispatched with 22 other people to the Del Loma Fire in the Shasta/Trinity Forest area, the Northern part of California. Each Crew had about 20 people, our plane that left Albuquerque held 2 crews. For almost the whole two weeks, we were all on standby. On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire. It was close to sun down when, a couple of guys were amazed at something. I heard them from inside my tent, but just ignored the whole thing until one of my crew members came and pulled me out of my tent. <BR><BR>I had no idea what I was supposed to be looking at or for. He pointed across the river and I was in shock when he pointed out the biggest, hairiest mammal I had ever seen just walking along the river side minding his own business. It stopped and looked at us. The way he stood on his hind legs was like an ordinary human. He had dark, long hair and stood about 7ft tall with a muscular build. <BR><BR>At this point I was the 4th person standing there in amazement. Maybe about 5 minutes of watching him watch us, with more people coming out with flashlights (because the sun was still going down) he darted in to the trees. He was running, taking long strides, and was gone in about 3 seconds.....and was literally pushing trees out of his way (not breaking them, but  pushing them out of his way). The trees behind him on his path up the mountain were swaying back and forth. I was surprised to see to these trees moving because they are thick in width and very tall. <BR><BR>By this time it was dark but lit enough to see which way he was headed. Up the mountain a little, there was a clearing, where we spotted him again before he disappeared for good. He made no noise, no yelling or screaming. He was just as timid as can be.<BR><BR>I have heard many stories about Bigfoot, and known that they are real but when seeing one in real life....you get a sense of respect for them and just have that feeling that there is more to life than you know. <BR><BR><BR><BR>" 1}, :cardinality 99}, :environment {:data-type "string", :distinct 449, :group-by? true, :commons {nil 41, "Pine forest" 6, "Forest" 3}, :cardinality 89}, :fixed_year {:data-type "string", :distinct 77, :group-by? true, :commons {"2001" 30, "2000" 25, "1998" 23}, :cardinality 15}, :run_time {:data-type "string", :distinct 187, :group-by? true, :commons {"2022-05-20 16:15:54.000000" 4, "2022-05-20 16:15:30.000000" 4, "2022-05-20 16:14:33.000000" 4}, :cardinality 37}}, :rowcount 500}, :state-drag-131 {:fields {:state {:data-type "string", :distinct 68, :group-by? true, :commons {nil 5, "nt" 4, "yt" 4}, :cardinality 43}, :country {:data-type "string", :distinct 6, :group-by? true, :commons {nil 68, "us" 52, "ca" 16}, :cardinality 3}, :rowcnt {:data-type "integer", :distinct 121, :group-by? false, :commons {1 15, 2 5, 1255 2}, :cardinality 77}}, :rowcount 157}, :class-drag-993 {:fields {:class {:data-type "string", :distinct 3, :group-by? true, :commons {"Class C" 1, "Class B" 1, "Class A" 1}, :cardinality 100}, :rowcnt {:data-type "integer", :distinct 3, :group-by? false, :commons {5 1, 37 1, 50 1}, :cardinality 100}}, :rowcount 3}, :state-drag-205 {:fields {:state {:data-type "string", :distinct 29, :group-by? true, :commons {"Maine" 1, "Arkansas" 1, "Florida" 1}, :cardinality 100}, :rowcnt {:data-type "integer", :distinct 8, :group-by? false, :commons {1 8, 2 7, 3 5}, :cardinality 27}}, :rowcount 29}, :ufo-sightings-drag-180 {:fields {:duration_seconds_int {:data-type "integer", :distinct 57, :group-by? true, :commons {300 64, 120 41, 600 39}, :cardinality 11}, :comments {:data-type "string", :distinct 500, :group-by? true, :commons {"Silent average-looking airplane hovers over Leupp exit butte on I-40 for 15-30 mins&#44 hundreds of witnesses." 1, "NW TN TRIANGLE." 1, "a manta ray shaped object with orange and yellow lights flashing in" 1}, :cardinality 100}, :city {:data-type "string", :distinct 436, :group-by? true, :commons {"austin" 4, "tinley park" 4, "portville" 4}, :cardinality 87}, :date_posted {:data-type "string", :distinct 135, :group-by? true, :commons {"2006-10-30" 28, "2012-10-30" 28, "2010-11-21" 27}, :cardinality 27}, :longitude {:data-type "float", :distinct 442, :group-by? true, :commons {-112.0733333 4, -78.3411111 4, -87.7844444 4}, :cardinality 88}, :state {:data-type "string", :distinct 54, :group-by? true, :commons {"ca" 50, nil 33, "tx" 28}, :cardinality 10}, :duration_seconds {:data-type "string", :distinct 57, :group-by? true, :commons {"300" 64, "120" 41, "600" 39}, :cardinality 11}, :duration_hours {:data-type "string", :distinct 229, :group-by? true, :commons {"5 minutes" 35, "30 seconds" 25, "1 minute" 22}, :cardinality 45}, :id {:data-type "integer", :distinct 500, :group-by? true, :commons {1524 1, 1609 1, 390 1}, :cardinality 100}, :shape {:data-type "string", :distinct 4, :group-by? true, :commons {"triangle" 189, "other" 136, "oval" 108}, :cardinality 0}, :datetime {:data-type "string", :distinct 467, :group-by? true, :commons {"2005-10-01 01:00:00.000000" 4, "1999-10-11 20:15:00.000000" 4, "2013-10-12 20:00:00.000000" 3}, :cardinality 93}, :latitude {:data-type "string", :distinct 439, :group-by? true, :commons {"33.4483333" 4, "42.0386111" 4, "41.5733333" 4}, :cardinality 87}, :country {:data-type "string", :distinct 5, :group-by? true, :commons {"us" 406, nil 64, "ca" 14}, :cardinality 0}}, :rowcount 500}, :country-drag-382 {:fields {:country {:data-type "string", :distinct 6, :group-by? true, :commons {"us" 29, nil 24, "ca" 23}, :cardinality 4}, :shape {:data-type "string", :distinct 30, :group-by? true, :commons {"formation" 6, "rectangle" 6, "circle" 6}, :cardinality 21}, :rowcnt {:data-type "integer", :distinct 95, :group-by? false, :commons {1 13, 10 6, 9 6}, :cardinality 68}}, :rowcount 139}, :ufo-sightings-drag-67 {:fields {:duration_seconds_int {:data-type "integer", :distinct 54, :group-by? true, :commons {120 42, 300 38, 60 33}, :cardinality 10}, :comments {:data-type "string", :distinct 500, :group-by? true, :commons {"A green light flew up into the sky&#44 moved left&#44 and descended." 1, "Craft landing on Mt.

It was late afternoon when we noticed a strong odor that we thought might be elk so we headed east toward a small ridge hoping to find one on the other side.  As we got closer we heard the noise of rocks being banged together.  As we topped the ridge we saw a large dark brown animal squatting at the edge of a dry creek bed with it''s back toward us. It was banging 2 rocks together with it''s \"hands\" and making a grunting/growling noise each time the  rocks hit.<BR><BR>It seemed to sense our presence almost immediately and turned around and looked at us.  Then it quickly stood up and jumped across the creek in one motion.  I remember thinking \"nothing can move like that!\".  It ran up the slope on the north side of the creek bed at an angle and disappeared into the pine and aspen trees farther up the hill.  We could see it for about 50 feet before it was gone from sight.  It moved real quietly for something that big.<BR><BR>I estimate it''s height as 6''5''''.  It was covered with long dark brown hair that made me think of a yak.  It had a strong smell, at least there was a strong smell in the area that was like elk urine.<BR><BR>After we calmed down a bit, we went into the creek bed and found the 2 rocks which were chipped and broken.  We looked for other signs in that place but couldn''t find anything else." 1, " I was working in the northern part of New Mexico training to be a Wildland Fire Fighter. In September 2003 (maybe the second week of that month) I was dispatched with 22 other people to the Del Loma Fire in the Shasta/Trinity Forest area, the Northern part of California. Each Crew had about 20 people, our plane that left Albuquerque held 2 crews. For almost the whole two weeks, we were all on standby. On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire. It was close to sun down when, a couple of guys were amazed at something. I heard them from inside my tent, but just ignored the whole thing until one of my crew members came and pulled me out of my tent. <BR><BR>I had no idea what I was supposed to be looking at or for. He pointed across the river and I was in shock when he pointed out the biggest, hairiest mammal I had ever seen just walking along the river side minding his own business. It stopped and looked at us. The way he stood on his hind legs was like an ordinary human. He had dark, long hair and stood about 7ft tall with a muscular build. <BR><BR>At this point I was the 4th person standing there in amazement. Maybe about 5 minutes of watching him watch us, with more people coming out with flashlights (because the sun was still going down) he darted in to the trees. He was running, taking long strides, and was gone in about 3 seconds.....and was literally pushing trees out of his way (not breaking them, but  pushing them out of his way). The trees behind him on his path up the mountain were swaying back and forth. I was surprised to see to these trees moving because they are thick in width and very tall. <BR><BR>By this time it was dark but lit enough to see which way he was headed. Up the mountain a little, there was a clearing, where we spotted him again before he disappeared for good. He made no noise, no yelling or screaming. He was just as timid as can be.<BR><BR>I have heard many stories about Bigfoot, and known that they are real but when seeing one in real life....you get a sense of respect for them and just have that feeling that there is more to life than you know. <BR><BR><BR><BR>" 1}, :cardinality 98}, :environment {:data-type "string", :distinct 457, :group-by?

It was late afternoon when we noticed a strong odor that we thought might be elk so we headed east toward a small ridge hoping to find one on the other side.  As we got closer we heard the noise of rocks being banged together.  As we topped the ridge we saw a large dark brown animal squatting at the edge of a dry creek bed with it''s back toward us. It was banging 2 rocks together with it''s \"hands\" and making a grunting/growling noise each time the  rocks hit.<BR><BR>It seemed to sense our presence almost immediately and turned around and looked at us.  Then it quickly stood up and jumped across the creek in one motion.  I remember thinking \"nothing can move like that!\".  It ran up the slope on the north side of the creek bed at an angle and disappeared into the pine and aspen trees farther up the hill.  We could see it for about 50 feet before it was gone from sight.  It moved real quietly for something that big.<BR><BR>I estimate it''s height as 6''5''''.  It was covered with long dark brown hair that made me think of a yak.  It had a strong smell, at least there was a strong smell in the area that was like elk urine.<BR><BR>After we calmed down a bit, we went into the creek bed and found the 2 rocks which were chipped and broken.  We looked for other signs in that place but couldn''t find anything else." 1, " I was working in the northern part of New Mexico training to be a Wildland Fire Fighter. In September 2003 (maybe the second week of that month) I was dispatched with 22 other people to the Del Loma Fire in the Shasta/Trinity Forest area, the Northern part of California. Each Crew had about 20 people, our plane that left Albuquerque held 2 crews. For almost the whole two weeks, we were all on standby. On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire. It was close to sun down when, a couple of guys were amazed at something. I heard them from inside my tent, but just ignored the whole thing until one of my crew members came and pulled me out of my tent. <BR><BR>I had no idea what I was supposed to be looking at or for. He pointed across the river and I was in shock when he pointed out the biggest, hairiest mammal I had ever seen just walking along the river side minding his own business. It stopped and looked at us. The way he stood on his hind legs was like an ordinary human. He had dark, long hair and stood about 7ft tall with a muscular build. <BR><BR>At this point I was the 4th person standing there in amazement. Maybe about 5 minutes of watching him watch us, with more people coming out with flashlights (because the sun was still going down) he darted in to the trees. He was running, taking long strides, and was gone in about 3 seconds.....and was literally pushing trees out of his way (not breaking them, but  pushing them out of his way). The trees behind him on his path up the mountain were swaying back and forth. I was surprised to see to these trees moving because they are thick in width and very tall. <BR><BR>By this time it was dark but lit enough to see which way he was headed. Up the mountain a little, there was a clearing, where we spotted him again before he disappeared for good. He made no noise, no yelling or screaming. He was just as timid as can be.<BR><BR>I have heard many stories about Bigfoot, and known that they are real but when seeing one in real life....you get a sense of respect for them and just have that feeling that there is more to life than you know. <BR><BR><BR><BR>" 1}, :cardinality 99}, :environment {:data-type "string", :distinct 449, :group-by?

He has a cement pad about 10 by 6 ft with a fence 6ft high around three sides of it. The trash cans were inside the fence.On night he heard noises out side,he got his rifle and looked out back.The porch light showed nothing near the trash cans but outside the fence he could see a shape of something so he shot up in the air.The animal ,which he could only describe as a big ape,got up and he could see it''s shouders and head above the fence.It took off as it rose up turning back towards the woods in a hurry.It tore up freshly planted bushes in it''s path. The ground left  no tracks other then in the soft dirt around the bushes.That''s the plaster cast the neighbor showed me.He gave it to the neighbor because he decided he didn''t believe in what he saw and didn''t want to be haunted by the sighting.They had the police there but I guess he made sure it was kept out of the papers.He just didn''t want his name out there. <BR>" 1, " I was a boy of about 12 years of age camping on my parent''s land.  We had a house atop a hill that sloped down an acre or two, leading to Bear Creek, which is where our property ended.  The land on both banks of the creek was thickly wooded and our land was not cleared all the way to the water.  Three of my friends and I had built a fire and unrolled our sleeping bags about a hundred yards or so away from the house in the direction of the creek.  One of the younger boys was not permitted to stay all night and as he left to go home, two of us were shining our flashlights at him and teasing him about a boogey man getting him.  He was probably about twenty yards or less away from our little campsite, walking throught the tall (2-3 ft.) grass.  In the dim light of the flashlights at that distance I saw a few yards behind him and walking in the opposite direction a form that looked like a large biped.  My best estimate would make it 6'' 5\" or taller.  What I saw was from halfway between the elbow and shoulder to about halfway between the knee and ankle, so my height estimate is quite rough.  It took about three strides before it went from on side of the light to the other, the strides were long and smooth, not at all jerky, and it looked like the knees remained bent as if it was not standing straight upright but slouching somewhat, and the arms swung low.  Under the poor lighting conditions I could not tell what color it was, it looked gray in the shadowy lighting, and it looked furry or hairy.  Had I thought of it, I would have tried to follow the form with my falshlight, but the first thing I did was look at the boy sitting on the ground next to me, who was also holding a flashlight, and he was already looking at me very wide-eyed.  He asked \"Did you see that?\" and I stood up and called for the departing boy to come back.  He returned and when we told him what we had seen, neither he nor the other boy there believed us.  He went home and the two of us who had seen it, not venturing far from the fire, looked around with our flashlights but we didn''t see anything unusual.  Neither of us would admit we were afraid so we stayed all night (but didn''t sleep much)  The next day I looked for footprints or disturbed soil or grass and found nothing.        " 1, " Over, I think, 20 to 25 years ago, a woman in LaCresent was doing her dishes at night and looked up to see  what was a large hairy faced man looking into her window that was over her sink. The police were called and a hunt for the window peaker insued.  An officer on the police force, saw a large man, over 7 ft. tall, run across the highway.  He notified the desk.  They searched.  Tracks were found. they were very large with a sizable stride. <BR><BR>La Crosse Wisconsin then turned into a  hot bed of bigfoot hunters.  A man from I think Colorado came to La Crosse to look at the prints. He said that what ever made them was not wearing a false shoe because of the distribution of the weight in the print cast as well as tracks that went down to the river.  If someone was running around with a red ape suite on they were crazy. It was deer season in Jackson County and over in LaCresent Minn. Want to die, put on a suite of hair and run around in areas where people are hunting.  Who knows what it was. No proof only the sighting by a policeman, woman, and the tracks. Heck they had dogs out..everything. Nothing was tracked down. Vanished into the Mississippi bottoms. <BR><BR>I have been down in the McGilvray Bottoms north of La Crosse, right on the Mississippi up by Trempealeau. I have hunted back in this large swamp for big swamp buck. When I get back in their  I have felt something with me. I felt it on several occasions. I walk, it walks ( and I know the difference between a deer and a person). I feel like something moves when I do. If I sit down for two to three hours, something moves around out there. Never find tracks. I have hunted for many years all over. I leave it at that. If their is something like a cleaver ape, it may travel along the Mississippi bottom land country. Its thick, swampy, and no one  goes there except to maybe hunt snakes, ducks, or deer. It is wet, thick and the Magilliary is where I would go if I wanted to stay out of sight, especially when hunting season starts. Thats when I have heard what ever it was. It stayed with me twice. I walk, it walks. I have never seen anything though nor found one print. Believe me, Ive looked.  Its Hunting season again in Wisconsin, Think like them. <BR>  <BR><BR>" 1}, :cardinality 100}, :environment {:data-type "string", :distinct 69, :group-by? true, :commons {nil 24, "hardwood forest woods all around there was whisky stills in the woods my grandpa had one also" 1, "Outskirt of swamp.

Joaquin River in what would be the northwestern part of town. Actually in Fresno. The area is mostly farm land and some sparse woods and vineyards. nothing like foresty though. My self, my cousin and a friend had decided to go late night fishing at a little area on the river where the river sort of pools. Their is a bridge there. It was late and we were sitting there and fishing when we heard something making noise and looked back and saw a coyote running across the bridge heading north. The coyote kept looking back as it ran as if it was frightened.The coyote looked at us but it was clearly focused on something behind it and it was scared. We thought at that time that that was odd. We then heard what we thought was a splash as if someone had dove into the water behind us. It was dark so we just glanced back but of course saw nothing. We probably sat for about 10 minutes or so when suddenly there was a huge goosh and splash about 25 yards away in front of us. We stopped fishing and then tried looking into the darkness.This small boulder throwing continued at least 2 more times before we actually saw a dark figure about 40 yards away standing what looked about waist high in the river. Their was a full moon so it wasn''t to dark to see that it was a pretty big creature. By this time we were starting to get scared and were pretty much froze in place and had began to yell at it, thinking that it could be a person. This prompted my friend to yell threats of violence as young people are sometime prone to do, this creature basically turned it''s whole body to the right of it and grapped another boulder and with both hands over its head it threw it at us, this one landed about 15 yards away. It made no sound or noise only threw small boulders. It threw about 2 more boulders the last landing about 5 yards from us enough to splash water on our faces. By this time we had reeled in our lines and were trying to get out of there as fast as we could. We ran all the way back to the car which was through some trees across a field and up a hill. We went back the next day to the area and on rafts floated to the area where the creature had stood. My friend is about 6 foot tall and jumped in the water to see about how deep it was. The water came to his shoulders. Their was no way this was a man. We even saw some of the boulders that had been thrown at the bottom of the water as it wasn''t more then 5 1/2 feet deep.

While back packing in along the forestry trail leading down to the river, we missed a trail marker and wound up at night along the canyon rim.  We made camp on a bluff slightly below the canyon rim.  I didn''t sleep well that night.  I had a feeling I was being watched and was uneasy. Breaking camp the next morning, Van went for water coming from an artesian spring in the wall of the canyon.  He found one very clear bigfoot footprint in the wet sand below the spring, about 80 feet from where we''d camped.  He called to me to come over and see.  My first reaction was this was a hoax.  Van and I examined the footprint in detail.  It was about 17 inches in length, with 5 clear toes and pressed down about 2 1/2 inches in the sand.  There was a musty smell in the area but this wasn''t overpowering.  Van concluded the print was real based upon the fact it had rained hard the previous morning and you could see the pattern of the rain drops on the surface of the sand except where the footprint was.  Also whatever had the print may very well be slightly above us at the end of the bluff in some rock outcroppings.  He suggested we get out of there while the getting was good.  Van had grown up in Minnesota hunting and fishing with his dad and brothers.  I decided we should take his advice.  We left and back tracked to Van''s Toyota Landcruiser.  We went over to Bass lake to fish for the rest of the weekend.", :environment "This area is around 4500 to 5000 feet in altitude and is covered primarily with conifer forest with some very heavy underbrush in areas.

It was late afternoon when we noticed a strong odor that we thought might be elk so we headed east toward a small ridge hoping to find one on the other side.  As we got closer we heard the noise of rocks being banged together.  As we topped the ridge we saw a large dark brown animal squatting at the edge of a dry creek bed with it''s back toward us. It was banging 2 rocks together with it''s \"hands\" and making a grunting/growling noise each time the  rocks hit.<BR><BR>It seemed to sense our presence almost immediately and turned around and looked at us.  Then it quickly stood up and jumped across the creek in one motion.  I remember thinking \"nothing can move like that!\".  It ran up the slope on the north side of the creek bed at an angle and disappeared into the pine and aspen trees farther up the hill.  We could see it for about 50 feet before it was gone from sight.  It moved real quietly for something that big.<BR><BR>I estimate it''s height as 6''5''''.  It was covered with long dark brown hair that made me think of a yak.  It had a strong smell, at least there was a strong smell in the area that was like elk urine.<BR><BR>After we calmed down a bit, we went into the creek bed and found the 2 rocks which were chipped and broken.  We looked for other signs in that place but couldn''t find anything else." 1, " I was working in the northern part of New Mexico training to be a Wildland Fire Fighter. In September 2003 (maybe the second week of that month) I was dispatched with 22 other people to the Del Loma Fire in the Shasta/Trinity Forest area, the Northern part of California. Each Crew had about 20 people, our plane that left Albuquerque held 2 crews. For almost the whole two weeks, we were all on standby. On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire. It was close to sun down when, a couple of guys were amazed at something.

It was late afternoon when we noticed a strong odor that we thought might be elk so we headed east toward a small ridge hoping to find one on the other side.  As we got closer we heard the noise of rocks being banged together.  As we topped the ridge we saw a large dark brown animal squatting at the edge of a dry creek bed with it''s back toward us. It was banging 2 rocks together with it''s \"hands\" and making a grunting/growling noise each time the  rocks hit.<BR><BR>It seemed to sense our presence almost immediately and turned around and looked at us.  Then it quickly stood up and jumped across the creek in one motion.  I remember thinking \"nothing can move like that!\".  It ran up the slope on the north side of the creek bed at an angle and disappeared into the pine and aspen trees farther up the hill.  We could see it for about 50 feet before it was gone from sight.  It moved real quietly for something that big.<BR><BR>I estimate it''s height as 6''5''''.  It was covered with long dark brown hair that made me think of a yak.  It had a strong smell, at least there was a strong smell in the area that was like elk urine.<BR><BR>After we calmed down a bit, we went into the creek bed and found the 2 rocks which were chipped and broken.

On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire.

It was late afternoon when we noticed a strong odor that we thought might be elk so we headed east toward a small ridge hoping to find one on the other side.  As we got closer we heard the noise of rocks being banged together.  As we topped the ridge we saw a large dark brown animal squatting at the edge of a dry creek bed with it''s back toward us. It was banging 2 rocks together with it''s \"hands\" and making a grunting/growling noise each time the  rocks hit.<BR><BR>It seemed to sense our presence almost immediately and turned around and looked at us.  Then it quickly stood up and jumped across the creek in one motion.  I remember thinking \"nothing can move like that!\".  It ran up the slope on the north side of the creek bed at an angle and disappeared into the pine and aspen trees farther up the hill.  We could see it for about 50 feet before it was gone from sight.  It moved real quietly for something that big.<BR><BR>I estimate it''s height as 6''5''''.  It was covered with long dark brown hair that made me think of a yak.  It had a strong smell, at least there was a strong smell in the area that was like elk urine.<BR><BR>After we calmed down a bit, we went into the creek bed and found the 2 rocks which were chipped and broken.  We looked for other signs in that place but couldn''t find anything else." 1, " I was working in the northern part of New Mexico training to be a Wildland Fire Fighter. In September 2003 (maybe the second week of that month) I was dispatched with 22 other people to the Del Loma Fire in the Shasta/Trinity Forest area, the Northern part of California. Each Crew had about 20 people, our plane that left Albuquerque held 2 crews. For almost the whole two weeks, we were all on standby. On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire. It was close to sun down when, a couple of guys were amazed at something. I heard them from inside my tent, but just ignored the whole thing until one of my crew members came and pulled me out of my tent. <BR><BR>I had no idea what I was supposed to be looking at or for. He pointed across the river and I was in shock when he pointed out the biggest, hairiest mammal I had ever seen just walking along the river side minding his own business. It stopped and looked at us. The way he stood on his hind legs was like an ordinary human. He had dark, long hair and stood about 7ft tall with a muscular build. <BR><BR>At this point I was the 4th person standing there in amazement. Maybe about 5 minutes of watching him watch us, with more people coming out with flashlights (because the sun was still going down) he darted in to the trees. He was running, taking long strides, and was gone in about 3 seconds.....and was literally pushing trees out of his way (not breaking them, but  pushing them out of his way). The trees behind him on his path up the mountain were swaying back and forth. I was surprised to see to these trees moving because they are thick in width and very tall. <BR><BR>By this time it was dark but lit enough to see which way he was headed. Up the mountain a little, there was a clearing, where we spotted him again before he disappeared for good. He made no noise, no yelling or screaming. He was just as timid as can be.<BR><BR>I have heard many stories about Bigfoot, and known that they are real but when seeing one in real life....you get a sense of respect for them and just have that feeling that there is more to life than you know. <BR><BR><BR><BR>" 1}, :cardinality 99}, :environment {:data-type "string", :distinct 449, :group-by?

In September 2003 (maybe the second week of that month) I was dispatched with 22 other people to the Del Loma Fire in the Shasta/Trinity Forest area, the Northern part of California. Each Crew had about 20 people, our plane that left Albuquerque held 2 crews. For almost the whole two weeks, we were all on standby. On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire.

He had dark, long hair and stood about 7ft tall with a muscular build. <BR><BR>At this point I was the 4th person standing there in amazement. Maybe about 5 minutes of watching him watch us, with more people coming out with flashlights (because the sun was still going down) he darted in to the trees. He was running, taking long strides, and was gone in about 3 seconds.....and was literally pushing trees out of his way (not breaking them, but  pushing them out of his way).

On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire.

It was banging 2 rocks together with it''s \"hands\" and making a grunting/growling noise each time the  rocks hit.<BR><BR>It seemed to sense our presence almost immediately and turned around and looked at us.  Then it quickly stood up and jumped across the creek in one motion.  I remember thinking \"nothing can move like that!\".  It ran up the slope on the north side of the creek bed at an angle and disappeared into the pine and aspen trees farther up the hill.  We could see it for about 50 feet before it was gone from sight.  It moved real quietly for something that big.<BR><BR>I estimate it''s height as 6''5''''.  It was covered with long dark brown hair that made me think of a yak.

Each Crew had about 20 people, our plane that left Albuquerque held 2 crews. For almost the whole two weeks, we were all on standby. On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire. It was close to sun down when, a couple of guys were amazed at something. I heard them from inside my tent, but just ignored the whole thing until one of my crew members came and pulled me out of my tent. <BR><BR>I had no idea what I was supposed to be looking at or for. He pointed across the river and I was in shock when he pointed out the biggest, hairiest mammal I had ever seen just walking along the river side minding his own business.

Anyhow I was figuring that I was north of rt 78 and just kind of \"Lewis and Clarked\" it toward home via the mirror compass in my car and made the first left southbound that I could once I realized I was heading west and didn''t recognize any landmarks. <BR><BR>I turn down this road and notice some construction equipment not far off into the trees on the right side of the road. I was driving slower than normal being unfarmiliar with the area and since I kept peeking at the compass to make sure I was still southbound (looking back it must have been overcast since I would have just used the location of the sun as a reference to direction).<BR>As I was driving along I caught movement out of the corner of my eye and saw a young deer (judging by size) bolt out of the trees across the road from left to right about 100-200 feet in front of my car. I just took my foot off the gas and didn''t need to brake, then I looked left for followers and saw what appeard to be a hunter in a dark colored ghillie suit burst from the trees after the deer. I couldnt make out any details of the face feet or hands but he/it was only around 6 feet tall or so and I''d estimate the low 200lb range but was unusually fast especially for someone dressed like that. The second thought in my head since I fish and shoot a bit was that it couldn''t possibly be legal to hunt around that area since its fairly close to residential zones. Then I noticed that the hunter had no weapons in his hands. I got up to the spot where they crossed and looked right and noticed that the biped (hunter) actually closed ground on the deer and was still in pursuit. I don''t know if the deer stopped to look back at some point as they some times do but this thing was in a full tilt sprint over what I would assume to be uneven ground and didn''t stumble once. I didn''t hear or smell anything since I had my roof up and AC & radio on at the time.

We were making alot of noise of course with 3 children and 4 adults.  Even the owner drove back there in his pickup and stayed awhile... All I am saying is there was alot of noise and I had my Jack Russell Terrier, with me.<BR><BR>I came back to the park area along with my husband about 6:30p.m. The kids and their parents continued to stay out there and ride.  I got a call from my son.  He told me that my 7 year old grandson had just encountered some type of large animal.  He said that he wasn''t sure what it was but said it was big and looked sort of like a monkey with long hair all over it and had a bump on it''s head. He said it wasn''t running.  It scared him half to death and he looked behind him at his dad yelled for his help.  My son went on to say that he immediately sped up to where my grandson was and knew immediately something was wrong by the sound of his scream. He immediately got to where my grandson was on the 4-wheeler. He said that it was as if a limb had been pulled way back on a tree and then let go.  It was still moving when he got over there.  His immediate thought was, what is it? First thought was maybe a large dog, but as my grandson began to describe it standing all all fours and yet being as tall as his dad''s chest...dog seemed to be out of the question.   I wondered if there are bears in Oklahoma..  We sort of dismissed it but my grandson kept talking about it.  <BR><BR>You would just have to know this 7 year old.  He doesn''t lie about anything.  You can pretty much always believe him. He is a really calm, good kid who just loves 4-wheelers more than anything in life....<BR><BR>Anyway, we couldn''t figure out what it was and his parents are trying to convince my grandson that whatever it was is gone now.... my grandson  said, \"It looked like Harry on Harry and the Hendersons movie but with a bump on it''s head and it wasn''t standing up. He described it as having long hair all over it''s body.  He said it was the color of his hair(blonde) on part of it and dark too. <BR><BR>Well, late tonight, my husband called my son and told him that he knew of a man in Davis, Oklahoma that had written a book about bigfoot and swears that they are in Oklahoma... It sounded ridiculous until my daughter-in-law typed into a search engine on the internet tonight.. bigfoot sightings in oklahoma..  She began to read about them and that''s when my grandson said, \"that''s what I saw except it wasn''t standing up.<BR><BR>Now it''s got us wondering if whatever my grandson saw today, actually lives there and is upset that we have disturbed it all.<BR><BR>I mean what animal would come that close to all that noise of 4-wheelers and people and cars and a barking Jack Russell dog? It was approx. 7:00pm when this happened today and still light outside.<BR><BR>I don''t know what to make of it except my grandson saw something that scared him bad, so much so that he refuses to do his most favorite thing....ride the 4-wheelers at Papa and Nanas." 1}, :cardinality 98}, :environment {:data-type "string", :distinct 477, :group-by? true, :commons {nil 22, "Forest" 3, "A lot of brush and pricker bushes and fallen trees.

forest that we could not explain.  <BR><BR>The location was in the area of Mono Hot Springs, in the Sierra Nevada''s in California, specifically, the John Muir Wilderness.  <BR><BR>My brother friend and I were fishing at Doris Lake near dusk.  Doris Lake is roughly a mile and a half hike from the resort of Mono.  Nothing unusual was happening and then out of nowhere, we heard a scream come from across the lake and up in the Mountians.  There were no people or animals that we could see anywhere.  We were in the proverbial wilderness.  My brother and I looked at each other, and unable to readily discern what we were hearing we continued to fish.  I did say to him, if I hear that again I am out of here. Well, a minute or so later, the same scream.  The three of us immediately reeled in and began to run all the way back to the resort, without stopping.  <BR><BR>I have listened to various recordings of alleged Bigfoot, and I am struck by how similar these recordings are to the scream that we heard.  I did not see anything, so I cant be sure, but I am fairly certian what I heard was not a human, bear or mountian lion.  So....what could it be?<BR><BR>Note:  my brother and sister worked for several years at Mono Hot Springs.  My sisters good friend who worked their as well had a horse which she kept in the summer time at the springs. While riding in the back country, she claims to have seen Bigfoot walking through a meadow below a bluff she was riding atop.

Actually in Fresno. The area is mostly farm land and some sparse woods and vineyards. nothing like foresty though. My self, my cousin and a friend had decided to go late night fishing at a little area on the river where the river sort of pools. Their is a bridge there. It was late and we were sitting there and fishing when we heard something making noise and looked back and saw a coyote running across the bridge heading north. The coyote kept looking back as it ran as if it was frightened.The coyote looked at us but it was clearly focused on something behind it and it was scared. We thought at that time that that was odd. We then heard what we thought was a splash as if someone had dove into the water behind us. It was dark so we just glanced back but of course saw nothing. We probably sat for about 10 minutes or so when suddenly there was a huge goosh and splash about 25 yards away in front of us. We stopped fishing and then tried looking into the darkness.This small boulder throwing continued at least 2 more times before we actually saw a dark figure about 40 yards away standing what looked about waist high in the river. Their was a full moon so it wasn''t to dark to see that it was a pretty big creature. By this time we were starting to get scared and were pretty much froze in place and had began to yell at it, thinking that it could be a person. This prompted my friend to yell threats of violence as young people are sometime prone to do, this creature basically turned it''s whole body to the right of it and grapped another boulder and with both hands over its head it threw it at us, this one landed about 15 yards away. It made no sound or noise only threw small boulders. It threw about 2 more boulders the last landing about 5 yards from us enough to splash water on our faces. By this time we had reeled in our lines and were trying to get out of there as fast as we could. We ran all the way back to the car which was through some trees across a field and up a hill. We went back the next day to the area and on rafts floated to the area where the creature had stood. My friend is about 6 foot tall and jumped in the water to see about how deep it was. The water came to his shoulders. Their was no way this was a man. We even saw some of the boulders that had been thrown at the bottom of the water as it wasn''t more then 5 1/2 feet deep. Their was a sand bar and the boulders were at least 30 to 40 lbs.

While back packing in along the forestry trail leading down to the river, we missed a trail marker and wound up at night along the canyon rim.  We made camp on a bluff slightly below the canyon rim.  I didn''t sleep well that night.  I had a feeling I was being watched and was uneasy. Breaking camp the next morning, Van went for water coming from an artesian spring in the wall of the canyon.  He found one very clear bigfoot footprint in the wet sand below the spring, about 80 feet from where we''d camped.  He called to me to come over and see.  My first reaction was this was a hoax.  Van and I examined the footprint in detail.  It was about 17 inches in length, with 5 clear toes and pressed down about 2 1/2 inches in the sand.  There was a musty smell in the area but this wasn''t overpowering.  Van concluded the print was real based upon the fact it had rained hard the previous morning and you could see the pattern of the rain drops on the surface of the sand except where the footprint was.  Also whatever had the print may very well be slightly above us at the end of the bluff in some rock outcroppings.  He suggested we get out of there while the getting was good.  Van had grown up in Minnesota hunting and fishing with his dad and brothers.  I decided we should take his advice.  We left and back tracked to Van''s Toyota Landcruiser.  We went over to Bass lake to fish for the rest of the weekend.", :environment "This area is around 4500 to 5000 feet in altitude and is covered primarily with conifer forest with some very heavy underbrush in areas.

It was late afternoon when we noticed a strong odor that we thought might be elk so we headed east toward a small ridge hoping to find one on the other side.  As we got closer we heard the noise of rocks being banged together.  As we topped the ridge we saw a large dark brown animal squatting at the edge of a dry creek bed with it''s back toward us. It was banging 2 rocks together with it''s \"hands\" and making a grunting/growling noise each time the  rocks hit.<BR><BR>It seemed to sense our presence almost immediately and turned around and looked at us.  Then it quickly stood up and jumped across the creek in one motion.  I remember thinking \"nothing can move like that!\".  It ran up the slope on the north side of the creek bed at an angle and disappeared into the pine and aspen trees farther up the hill.  We could see it for about 50 feet before it was gone from sight.  It moved real quietly for something that big.<BR><BR>I estimate it''s height as 6''5''''.  It was covered with long dark brown hair that made me think of a yak.  It had a strong smell, at least there was a strong smell in the area that was like elk urine.<BR><BR>After we calmed down a bit, we went into the creek bed and found the 2 rocks which were chipped and broken.  We looked for other signs in that place but couldn''t find anything else." 1, " I was working in the northern part of New Mexico training to be a Wildland Fire Fighter. In September 2003 (maybe the second week of that month) I was dispatched with 22 other people to the Del Loma Fire in the Shasta/Trinity Forest area, the Northern part of California. Each Crew had about 20 people, our plane that left Albuquerque held 2 crews. For almost the whole two weeks, we were all on standby. On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire. It was close to sun down when, a couple of guys were amazed at something. I heard them from inside my tent, but just ignored the whole thing until one of my crew members came and pulled me out of my tent. <BR><BR>I had no idea what I was supposed to be looking at or for. He pointed across the river and I was in shock when he pointed out the biggest, hairiest mammal I had ever seen just walking along the river side minding his own business. It stopped and looked at us. The way he stood on his hind legs was like an ordinary human. He had dark, long hair and stood about 7ft tall with a muscular build. <BR><BR>At this point I was the 4th person standing there in amazement. Maybe about 5 minutes of watching him watch us, with more people coming out with flashlights (because the sun was still going down) he darted in to the trees. He was running, taking long strides, and was gone in about 3 seconds.....and was literally pushing trees out of his way (not breaking them, but  pushing them out of his way). The trees behind him on his path up the mountain were swaying back and forth. I was surprised to see to these trees moving because they are thick in width and very tall. <BR><BR>By this time it was dark but lit enough to see which way he was headed. Up the mountain a little, there was a clearing, where we spotted him again before he disappeared for good. He made no noise, no yelling or screaming. He was just as timid as can be.<BR><BR>I have heard many stories about Bigfoot, and known that they are real but when seeing one in real life....you get a sense of respect for them and just have that feeling that there is more to life than you know. <BR><BR><BR><BR>" 1}, :cardinality 99}, :environment {:data-type "string", :distinct 449, :group-by?

It was late afternoon when we noticed a strong odor that we thought might be elk so we headed east toward a small ridge hoping to find one on the other side.  As we got closer we heard the noise of rocks being banged together.  As we topped the ridge we saw a large dark brown animal squatting at the edge of a dry creek bed with it''s back toward us. It was banging 2 rocks together with it''s \"hands\" and making a grunting/growling noise each time the  rocks hit.<BR><BR>It seemed to sense our presence almost immediately and turned around and looked at us.  Then it quickly stood up and jumped across the creek in one motion.  I remember thinking \"nothing can move like that!\".  It ran up the slope on the north side of the creek bed at an angle and disappeared into the pine and aspen trees farther up the hill.  We could see it for about 50 feet before it was gone from sight.  It moved real quietly for something that big.<BR><BR>I estimate it''s height as 6''5''''.  It was covered with long dark brown hair that made me think of a yak.  It had a strong smell, at least there was a strong smell in the area that was like elk urine.<BR><BR>After we calmed down a bit, we went into the creek bed and found the 2 rocks which were chipped and broken.  We looked for other signs in that place but couldn''t find anything else." 1, " I was working in the northern part of New Mexico training to be a Wildland Fire Fighter. In September 2003 (maybe the second week of that month) I was dispatched with 22 other people to the Del Loma Fire in the Shasta/Trinity Forest area, the Northern part of California. Each Crew had about 20 people, our plane that left Albuquerque held 2 crews. For almost the whole two weeks, we were all on standby. On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire. It was close to sun down when, a couple of guys were amazed at something. I heard them from inside my tent, but just ignored the whole thing until one of my crew members came and pulled me out of my tent. <BR><BR>I had no idea what I was supposed to be looking at or for. He pointed across the river and I was in shock when he pointed out the biggest, hairiest mammal I had ever seen just walking along the river side minding his own business. It stopped and looked at us. The way he stood on his hind legs was like an ordinary human. He had dark, long hair and stood about 7ft tall with a muscular build. <BR><BR>At this point I was the 4th person standing there in amazement. Maybe about 5 minutes of watching him watch us, with more people coming out with flashlights (because the sun was still going down) he darted in to the trees. He was running, taking long strides, and was gone in about 3 seconds.....and was literally pushing trees out of his way (not breaking them, but  pushing them out of his way). The trees behind him on his path up the mountain were swaying back and forth. I was surprised to see to these trees moving because they are thick in width and very tall. <BR><BR>By this time it was dark but lit enough to see which way he was headed. Up the mountain a little, there was a clearing, where we spotted him again before he disappeared for good. He made no noise, no yelling or screaming. He was just as timid as can be.<BR><BR>I have heard many stories about Bigfoot, and known that they are real but when seeing one in real life....you get a sense of respect for them and just have that feeling that there is more to life than you know. <BR><BR><BR><BR>" 1}, :cardinality 99}, :environment {:data-type "string", :distinct 449, :group-by? true, :commons {nil 41, "Pine forest" 6, "Forest" 3}, :cardinality 89}, :fixed_year {:data-type "string", :distinct 77, :group-by? true, :commons {"2001" 30, "2000" 25, "1998" 23}, :cardinality 15}, :run_time {:data-type "string", :distinct 187, :group-by? true, :commons {"2022-05-20 16:15:54.000000" 4, "2022-05-20 16:15:30.000000" 4, "2022-05-20 16:14:33.000000" 4}, :cardinality 37}}, :rowcount 500}, :country-drag-382 {:fields {:country {:data-type "string", :distinct 6, :group-by? true, :commons {"us" 29, nil 24, "ca" 23}, :cardinality 4}, :shape {:data-type "string", :distinct 30, :group-by? true, :commons {"formation" 6, "rectangle" 6, "circle" 6}, :cardinality 21}, :rowcnt {:data-type "integer", :distinct 95, :group-by? false, :commons {1 13, 10 6, 9 6}, :cardinality 68}}, :rowcount 139}, :ufo-sightings-drag-67 {:fields {:duration_seconds_int {:data-type "integer", :distinct 54, :group-by? true, :commons {120 42, 300 38, 60 33}, :cardinality 10}, :comments {:data-type "string", :distinct 500, :group-by? true, :commons {"A green light flew up into the sky&#44 moved left&#44 and descended." 1, "Craft landing on Mt.

It was late afternoon when we noticed a strong odor that we thought might be elk so we headed east toward a small ridge hoping to find one on the other side.  As we got closer we heard the noise of rocks being banged together.  As we topped the ridge we saw a large dark brown animal squatting at the edge of a dry creek bed with it''s back toward us. It was banging 2 rocks together with it''s \"hands\" and making a grunting/growling noise each time the  rocks hit.<BR><BR>It seemed to sense our presence almost immediately and turned around and looked at us.  Then it quickly stood up and jumped across the creek in one motion.  I remember thinking \"nothing can move like that!\".  It ran up the slope on the north side of the creek bed at an angle and disappeared into the pine and aspen trees farther up the hill.  We could see it for about 50 feet before it was gone from sight.  It moved real quietly for something that big.<BR><BR>I estimate it''s height as 6''5''''.  It was covered with long dark brown hair that made me think of a yak.  It had a strong smell, at least there was a strong smell in the area that was like elk urine.<BR><BR>After we calmed down a bit, we went into the creek bed and found the 2 rocks which were chipped and broken.  We looked for other signs in that place but couldn''t find anything else." 1, " I was working in the northern part of New Mexico training to be a Wildland Fire Fighter. In September 2003 (maybe the second week of that month) I was dispatched with 22 other people to the Del Loma Fire in the Shasta/Trinity Forest area, the Northern part of California. Each Crew had about 20 people, our plane that left Albuquerque held 2 crews. For almost the whole two weeks, we were all on standby. On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire. It was close to sun down when, a couple of guys were amazed at something. I heard them from inside my tent, but just ignored the whole thing until one of my crew members came and pulled me out of my tent. <BR><BR>I had no idea what I was supposed to be looking at or for. He pointed across the river and I was in shock when he pointed out the biggest, hairiest mammal I had ever seen just walking along the river side minding his own business. It stopped and looked at us. The way he stood on his hind legs was like an ordinary human. He had dark, long hair and stood about 7ft tall with a muscular build. <BR><BR>At this point I was the 4th person standing there in amazement. Maybe about 5 minutes of watching him watch us, with more people coming out with flashlights (because the sun was still going down) he darted in to the trees. He was running, taking long strides, and was gone in about 3 seconds.....and was literally pushing trees out of his way (not breaking them, but  pushing them out of his way). The trees behind him on his path up the mountain were swaying back and forth. I was surprised to see to these trees moving because they are thick in width and very tall. <BR><BR>By this time it was dark but lit enough to see which way he was headed. Up the mountain a little, there was a clearing, where we spotted him again before he disappeared for good. He made no noise, no yelling or screaming. He was just as timid as can be.<BR><BR>I have heard many stories about Bigfoot, and known that they are real but when seeing one in real life....you get a sense of respect for them and just have that feeling that there is more to life than you know. <BR><BR><BR><BR>" 1}, :cardinality 99}, :environment {:data-type "string", :distinct 449, :group-by? true, :commons {nil 41, "Pine forest" 6, "Forest" 3}, :cardinality 89}, :fixed_year {:data-type "string", :distinct 77, :group-by? true, :commons {"2001" 30, "2000" 25, "1998" 23}, :cardinality 15}, :run_time {:data-type "string", :distinct 187, :group-by? true, :commons {"2022-05-20 16:15:54.000000" 4, "2022-05-20 16:15:30.000000" 4, "2022-05-20 16:14:33.000000" 4}, :cardinality 37}}, :rowcount 500}, :albums-drag-571 {:fields {:album_href {:data-type "string", :distinct 25, :group-by? true, :commons {"https://api.spotify.com/v1/albums/0vNBQof86Lv5gLuf26ML7o" 1, "https://api.spotify.com/v1/albums/4ljK2LVKvEPd5xPgUJn0Bs" 1, "https://api.spotify.com/v1/albums/70uejEPPRPSLBrTRdfghP5" 1}, :cardinality 100}, :album_name {:data-type "string", :distinct 25, :group-by? true, :commons {"...And Justice for All (Remastered Deluxe Box Set)" 1, "S&M" 1, "S&M2" 1}, :cardinality 100}, :img_300 {:data-type "string", :distinct 25, :group-by? true, :commons {"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02a49eff6d64cafc2551553380" 1, "https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02e9c415cdc78d53b9b8627274" 1, "https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e022fe08610316f3e5ebaa06d68" 1}, :cardinality 100}, :img_64 {:data-type "string", :distinct 25, :group-by? true, :commons {"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d000048518161357a12a172721e772e0d" 1, "https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d000048517e1f85f69323acac962516c4" 1, "https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d000048512127e0afac383fb73d533a7d" 1}, :cardinality 100}, :img_640 {:data-type "string", :distinct 25, :group-by? true, :commons {"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273a4c3675649cce210651d150d" 1, "https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273f1a501610a71d48c526c7ecd" 1, "https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2730a3eb7ef6df5732fc6fa77ec" 1}, :cardinality 100}, :popularity {:data-type "integer", :distinct 20, :group-by? true, :commons {64 3, 53 2, 57 2}, :cardinality 80}, :release_date {:data-type "string", :distinct 19, :group-by? true, :commons {"1986-03-03" 2, "1983-07-25" 2, "1988-09-07" 2}, :cardinality 75}, :ts {:data-type "string", :distinct 1, :group-by? true, :commons {"2023-09-24 19:19:15" 25}, :cardinality 3}}, :rowcount 25}, :query-7423-clone-908 {:fields {:rowcnt {:data-type "integer", :distinct 1, :group-by? false, :commons {10685 1}, :cardinality 100}}, :rowcount 1}, :rowcnt-drag-797->-rowcnt->-rowcnt {:fields {:duration_seconds_int {:data-type "integer", :distinct 17, :group-by? true, :commons {600 6, 5 5, 300 3}, :cardinality 50}, :comments {:data-type "string", :distinct 34, :group-by? true, :commons {"2 UFO&#39s sighted abover chevron island Goldcoast Queensland Australia  500 Lights On Object0: Yes" 1, "it was the scariest thing i&#39d ever seen." 1, "OK&#44 this&#44 I&#39m sure wasn&#39t a UFO - but I found a link&#44 and I thought I&#39d share it anyway...

Anyhow I was figuring that I was north of rt 78 and just kind of \"Lewis and Clarked\" it toward home via the mirror compass in my car and made the first left southbound that I could once I realized I was heading west and didn''t recognize any landmarks. <BR><BR>I turn down this road and notice some construction equipment not far off into the trees on the right side of the road. I was driving slower than normal being unfarmiliar with the area and since I kept peeking at the compass to make sure I was still southbound (looking back it must have been overcast since I would have just used the location of the sun as a reference to direction).<BR>As I was driving along I caught movement out of the corner of my eye and saw a young deer (judging by size) bolt out of the trees across the road from left to right about 100-200 feet in front of my car. I just took my foot off the gas and didn''t need to brake, then I looked left for followers and saw what appeard to be a hunter in a dark colored ghillie suit burst from the trees after the deer. I couldnt make out any details of the face feet or hands but he/it was only around 6 feet tall or so and I''d estimate the low 200lb range but was unusually fast especially for someone dressed like that. The second thought in my head since I fish and shoot a bit was that it couldn''t possibly be legal to hunt around that area since its fairly close to residential zones. Then I noticed that the hunter had no weapons in his hands. I got up to the spot where they crossed and looked right and noticed that the biped (hunter) actually closed ground on the deer and was still in pursuit. I don''t know if the deer stopped to look back at some point as they some times do but this thing was in a full tilt sprint over what I would assume to be uneven ground and didn''t stumble once. I didn''t hear or smell anything since I had my roof up and AC & radio on at the time. All of this happened I would estimate in less than 20 seconds total." 1, " First of all, we are staying at a park that has a winding deep creek at the back of 16 + acres.. anyway today my grandchildren and their parents came out to the park to see us.  The children''s parents recently bought them 4-wheelers and this is approx. the 4th time they have come to the park to ride them...<BR><BR>Today was just like every other time they have come out to ride them. We drive our vehicles about 1/8 mile away from the actual park grounds and that''s where the kids and adults ride the 4-wheelers.  We all rode back there for hours... We were making alot of noise of course with 3 children and 4 adults.  Even the owner drove back there in his pickup and stayed awhile... All I am saying is there was alot of noise and I had my Jack Russell Terrier, with me.<BR><BR>I came back to the park area along with my husband about 6:30p.m. The kids and their parents continued to stay out there and ride.  I got a call from my son.  He told me that my 7 year old grandson had just encountered some type of large animal.  He said that he wasn''t sure what it was but said it was big and looked sort of like a monkey with long hair all over it and had a bump on it''s head. He said it wasn''t running.  It scared him half to death and he looked behind him at his dad yelled for his help.  My son went on to say that he immediately sped up to where my grandson was and knew immediately something was wrong by the sound of his scream. He immediately got to where my grandson was on the 4-wheeler. He said that it was as if a limb had been pulled way back on a tree and then let go.  It was still moving when he got over there.  His immediate thought was, what is it? First thought was maybe a large dog, but as my grandson began to describe it standing all all fours and yet being as tall as his dad''s chest...dog seemed to be out of the question.   I wondered if there are bears in Oklahoma..  We sort of dismissed it but my grandson kept talking about it.  <BR><BR>You would just have to know this 7 year old.  He doesn''t lie about anything.  You can pretty much always believe him. He is a really calm, good kid who just loves 4-wheelers more than anything in life....<BR><BR>Anyway, we couldn''t figure out what it was and his parents are trying to convince my grandson that whatever it was is gone now.... my grandson  said, \"It looked like Harry on Harry and the Hendersons movie but with a bump on it''s head and it wasn''t standing up. He described it as having long hair all over it''s body.  He said it was the color of his hair(blonde) on part of it and dark too. <BR><BR>Well, late tonight, my husband called my son and told him that he knew of a man in Davis, Oklahoma that had written a book about bigfoot and swears that they are in Oklahoma... It sounded ridiculous until my daughter-in-law typed into a search engine on the internet tonight.. bigfoot sightings in oklahoma..  She began to read about them and that''s when my grandson said, \"that''s what I saw except it wasn''t standing up.<BR><BR>Now it''s got us wondering if whatever my grandson saw today, actually lives there and is upset that we have disturbed it all.<BR><BR>I mean what animal would come that close to all that noise of 4-wheelers and people and cars and a barking Jack Russell dog? It was approx. 7:00pm when this happened today and still light outside.<BR><BR>I don''t know what to make of it except my grandson saw something that scared him bad, so much so that he refuses to do his most favorite thing....ride the 4-wheelers at Papa and Nanas." 1}, :cardinality 98}, :environment {:data-type "string", :distinct 477, :group-by? true, :commons {nil 22, "Forest" 3, "A lot of brush and pricker bushes and fallen trees.

forest that we could not explain.  <BR><BR>The location was in the area of Mono Hot Springs, in the Sierra Nevada''s in California, specifically, the John Muir Wilderness.  <BR><BR>My brother friend and I were fishing at Doris Lake near dusk.  Doris Lake is roughly a mile and a half hike from the resort of Mono.  Nothing unusual was happening and then out of nowhere, we heard a scream come from across the lake and up in the Mountians.  There were no people or animals that we could see anywhere.  We were in the proverbial wilderness.  My brother and I looked at each other, and unable to readily discern what we were hearing we continued to fish.  I did say to him, if I hear that again I am out of here. Well, a minute or so later, the same scream.  The three of us immediately reeled in and began to run all the way back to the resort, without stopping.  <BR><BR>I have listened to various recordings of alleged Bigfoot, and I am struck by how similar these recordings are to the scream that we heard.  I did not see anything, so I cant be sure, but I am fairly certian what I heard was not a human, bear or mountian lion.  So....what could it be?<BR><BR>Note:  my brother and sister worked for several years at Mono Hot Springs.  My sisters good friend who worked their as well had a horse which she kept in the summer time at the springs.

Actually in Fresno. The area is mostly farm land and some sparse woods and vineyards. nothing like foresty though. My self, my cousin and a friend had decided to go late night fishing at a little area on the river where the river sort of pools. Their is a bridge there. It was late and we were sitting there and fishing when we heard something making noise and looked back and saw a coyote running across the bridge heading north. The coyote kept looking back as it ran as if it was frightened.The coyote looked at us but it was clearly focused on something behind it and it was scared. We thought at that time that that was odd. We then heard what we thought was a splash as if someone had dove into the water behind us. It was dark so we just glanced back but of course saw nothing. We probably sat for about 10 minutes or so when suddenly there was a huge goosh and splash about 25 yards away in front of us. We stopped fishing and then tried looking into the darkness.This small boulder throwing continued at least 2 more times before we actually saw a dark figure about 40 yards away standing what looked about waist high in the river. Their was a full moon so it wasn''t to dark to see that it was a pretty big creature. By this time we were starting to get scared and were pretty much froze in place and had began to yell at it, thinking that it could be a person. This prompted my friend to yell threats of violence as young people are sometime prone to do, this creature basically turned it''s whole body to the right of it and grapped another boulder and with both hands over its head it threw it at us, this one landed about 15 yards away. It made no sound or noise only threw small boulders. It threw about 2 more boulders the last landing about 5 yards from us enough to splash water on our faces. By this time we had reeled in our lines and were trying to get out of there as fast as we could. We ran all the way back to the car which was through some trees across a field and up a hill. We went back the next day to the area and on rafts floated to the area where the creature had stood. My friend is about 6 foot tall and jumped in the water to see about how deep it was. The water came to his shoulders. Their was no way this was a man. We even saw some of the boulders that had been thrown at the bottom of the water as it wasn''t more then 5 1/2 feet deep. Their was a sand bar and the boulders were at least 30 to 40 lbs.

While back packing in along the forestry trail leading down to the river, we missed a trail marker and wound up at night along the canyon rim.  We made camp on a bluff slightly below the canyon rim.  I didn''t sleep well that night.  I had a feeling I was being watched and was uneasy. Breaking camp the next morning, Van went for water coming from an artesian spring in the wall of the canyon.  He found one very clear bigfoot footprint in the wet sand below the spring, about 80 feet from where we''d camped.  He called to me to come over and see.  My first reaction was this was a hoax.  Van and I examined the footprint in detail.  It was about 17 inches in length, with 5 clear toes and pressed down about 2 1/2 inches in the sand.  There was a musty smell in the area but this wasn''t overpowering.  Van concluded the print was real based upon the fact it had rained hard the previous morning and you could see the pattern of the rain drops on the surface of the sand except where the footprint was.  Also whatever had the print may very well be slightly above us at the end of the bluff in some rock outcroppings.  He suggested we get out of there while the getting was good.  Van had grown up in Minnesota hunting and fishing with his dad and brothers.  I decided we should take his advice.  We left and back tracked to Van''s Toyota Landcruiser.  We went over to Bass lake to fish for the rest of the weekend.", :environment "This area is around 4500 to 5000 feet in altitude and is covered primarily with conifer forest with some very heavy underbrush in areas.

It was late afternoon when we noticed a strong odor that we thought might be elk so we headed east toward a small ridge hoping to find one on the other side.  As we got closer we heard the noise of rocks being banged together.  As we topped the ridge we saw a large dark brown animal squatting at the edge of a dry creek bed with it''s back toward us. It was banging 2 rocks together with it''s \"hands\" and making a grunting/growling noise each time the  rocks hit.<BR><BR>It seemed to sense our presence almost immediately and turned around and looked at us.  Then it quickly stood up and jumped across the creek in one motion.  I remember thinking \"nothing can move like that!\".  It ran up the slope on the north side of the creek bed at an angle and disappeared into the pine and aspen trees farther up the hill.

It was late afternoon when we noticed a strong odor that we thought might be elk so we headed east toward a small ridge hoping to find one on the other side.  As we got closer we heard the noise of rocks being banged together.  As we topped the ridge we saw a large dark brown animal squatting at the edge of a dry creek bed with it''s back toward us. It was banging 2 rocks together with it''s \"hands\" and making a grunting/growling noise each time the  rocks hit.<BR><BR>It seemed to sense our presence almost immediately and turned around and looked at us.  Then it quickly stood up and jumped across the creek in one motion.  I remember thinking \"nothing can move like that!\".  It ran up the slope on the north side of the creek bed at an angle and disappeared into the pine and aspen trees farther up the hill.  We could see it for about 50 feet before it was gone from sight.  It moved real quietly for something that big.<BR><BR>I estimate it''s height as 6''5''''.  It was covered with long dark brown hair that made me think of a yak.  It had a strong smell, at least there was a strong smell in the area that was like elk urine.<BR><BR>After we calmed down a bit, we went into the creek bed and found the 2 rocks which were chipped and broken.  We looked for other signs in that place but couldn''t find anything else." 1, " I was working in the northern part of New Mexico training to be a Wildland Fire Fighter. In September 2003 (maybe the second week of that month) I was dispatched with 22 other people to the Del Loma Fire in the Shasta/Trinity Forest area, the Northern part of California. Each Crew had about 20 people, our plane that left Albuquerque held 2 crews. For almost the whole two weeks, we were all on standby. On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire. It was close to sun down when, a couple of guys were amazed at something. I heard them from inside my tent, but just ignored the whole thing until one of my crew members came and pulled me out of my tent. <BR><BR>I had no idea what I was supposed to be looking at or for. He pointed across the river and I was in shock when he pointed out the biggest, hairiest mammal I had ever seen just walking along the river side minding his own business. It stopped and looked at us. The way he stood on his hind legs was like an ordinary human. He had dark, long hair and stood about 7ft tall with a muscular build. <BR><BR>At this point I was the 4th person standing there in amazement. Maybe about 5 minutes of watching him watch us, with more people coming out with flashlights (because the sun was still going down) he darted in to the trees. He was running, taking long strides, and was gone in about 3 seconds.....and was literally pushing trees out of his way (not breaking them, but  pushing them out of his way). The trees behind him on his path up the mountain were swaying back and forth. I was surprised to see to these trees moving because they are thick in width and very tall. <BR><BR>By this time it was dark but lit enough to see which way he was headed. Up the mountain a little, there was a clearing, where we spotted him again before he disappeared for good. He made no noise, no yelling or screaming.

In September 2003 (maybe the second week of that month) I was dispatched with 22 other people to the Del Loma Fire in the Shasta/Trinity Forest area, the Northern part of California. Each Crew had about 20 people, our plane that left Albuquerque held 2 crews. For almost the whole two weeks, we were all on standby. On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire. It was close to sun down when, a couple of guys were amazed at something. I heard them from inside my tent, but just ignored the whole thing until one of my crew members came and pulled me out of my tent. <BR><BR>I had no idea what I was supposed to be looking at or for. He pointed across the river and I was in shock when he pointed out the biggest, hairiest mammal I had ever seen just walking along the river side minding his own business. It stopped and looked at us. The way he stood on his hind legs was like an ordinary human.

Maybe about 5 minutes of watching him watch us, with more people coming out with flashlights (because the sun was still going down) he darted in to the trees.

It was late afternoon when we noticed a strong odor that we thought might be elk so we headed east toward a small ridge hoping to find one on the other side.  As we got closer we heard the noise of rocks being banged together.  As we topped the ridge we saw a large dark brown animal squatting at the edge of a dry creek bed with it''s back toward us. It was banging 2 rocks together with it''s \"hands\" and making a grunting/growling noise each time the  rocks hit.<BR><BR>It seemed to sense our presence almost immediately and turned around and looked at us.  Then it quickly stood up and jumped across the creek in one motion.  I remember thinking \"nothing can move like that!\".  It ran up the slope on the north side of the creek bed at an angle and disappeared into the pine and aspen trees farther up the hill.  We could see it for about 50 feet before it was gone from sight.  It moved real quietly for something that big.<BR><BR>I estimate it''s height as 6''5''''.  It was covered with long dark brown hair that made me think of a yak.  It had a strong smell, at least there was a strong smell in the area that was like elk urine.<BR><BR>After we calmed down a bit, we went into the creek bed and found the 2 rocks which were chipped and broken.  We looked for other signs in that place but couldn''t find anything else." 1, " I was working in the northern part of New Mexico training to be a Wildland Fire Fighter. In September 2003 (maybe the second week of that month) I was dispatched with 22 other people to the Del Loma Fire in the Shasta/Trinity Forest area, the Northern part of California. Each Crew had about 20 people, our plane that left Albuquerque held 2 crews. For almost the whole two weeks, we were all on standby. On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire. It was close to sun down when, a couple of guys were amazed at something. I heard them from inside my tent, but just ignored the whole thing until one of my crew members came and pulled me out of my tent. <BR><BR>I had no idea what I was supposed to be looking at or for. He pointed across the river and I was in shock when he pointed out the biggest, hairiest mammal I had ever seen just walking along the river side minding his own business. It stopped and looked at us. The way he stood on his hind legs was like an ordinary human. He had dark, long hair and stood about 7ft tall with a muscular build. <BR><BR>At this point I was the 4th person standing there in amazement. Maybe about 5 minutes of watching him watch us, with more people coming out with flashlights (because the sun was still going down) he darted in to the trees. He was running, taking long strides, and was gone in about 3 seconds.....and was literally pushing trees out of his way (not breaking them, but  pushing them out of his way). The trees behind him on his path up the mountain were swaying back and forth. I was surprised to see to these trees moving because they are thick in width and very tall. <BR><BR>By this time it was dark but lit enough to see which way he was headed. Up the mountain a little, there was a clearing, where we spotted him again before he disappeared for good. He made no noise, no yelling or screaming. He was just as timid as can be.<BR><BR>I have heard many stories about Bigfoot, and known that they are real but when seeing one in real life....you get a sense of respect for them and just have that feeling that there is more to life than you know. <BR><BR><BR><BR>" 1}, :cardinality 99}, :environment {:data-type "string", :distinct 449, :group-by?

Anyhow I was figuring that I was north of rt 78 and just kind of \"Lewis and Clarked\" it toward home via the mirror compass in my car and made the first left southbound that I could once I realized I was heading west and didn''t recognize any landmarks. <BR><BR>I turn down this road and notice some construction equipment not far off into the trees on the right side of the road. I was driving slower than normal being unfarmiliar with the area and since I kept peeking at the compass to make sure I was still southbound (looking back it must have been overcast since I would have just used the location of the sun as a reference to direction).<BR>As I was driving along I caught movement out of the corner of my eye and saw a young deer (judging by size) bolt out of the trees across the road from left to right about 100-200 feet in front of my car. I just took my foot off the gas and didn''t need to brake, then I looked left for followers and saw what appeard to be a hunter in a dark colored ghillie suit burst from the trees after the deer. I couldnt make out any details of the face feet or hands but he/it was only around 6 feet tall or so and I''d estimate the low 200lb range but was unusually fast especially for someone dressed like that. The second thought in my head since I fish and shoot a bit was that it couldn''t possibly be legal to hunt around that area since its fairly close to residential zones. Then I noticed that the hunter had no weapons in his hands. I got up to the spot where they crossed and looked right and noticed that the biped (hunter) actually closed ground on the deer and was still in pursuit. I don''t know if the deer stopped to look back at some point as they some times do but this thing was in a full tilt sprint over what I would assume to be uneven ground and didn''t stumble once. I didn''t hear or smell anything since I had my roof up and AC & radio on at the time. All of this happened I would estimate in less than 20 seconds total." 1, " First of all, we are staying at a park that has a winding deep creek at the back of 16 + acres.. anyway today my grandchildren and their parents came out to the park to see us.  The children''s parents recently bought them 4-wheelers and this is approx. the 4th time they have come to the park to ride them...<BR><BR>Today was just like every other time they have come out to ride them. We drive our vehicles about 1/8 mile away from the actual park grounds and that''s where the kids and adults ride the 4-wheelers.  We all rode back there for hours... We were making alot of noise of course with 3 children and 4 adults.  Even the owner drove back there in his pickup and stayed awhile... All I am saying is there was alot of noise and I had my Jack Russell Terrier, with me.<BR><BR>I came back to the park area along with my husband about 6:30p.m. The kids and their parents continued to stay out there and ride.  I got a call from my son.  He told me that my 7 year old grandson had just encountered some type of large animal.  He said that he wasn''t sure what it was but said it was big and looked sort of like a monkey with long hair all over it and had a bump on it''s head. He said it wasn''t running.  It scared him half to death and he looked behind him at his dad yelled for his help.  My son went on to say that he immediately sped up to where my grandson was and knew immediately something was wrong by the sound of his scream. He immediately got to where my grandson was on the 4-wheeler. He said that it was as if a limb had been pulled way back on a tree and then let go.  It was still moving when he got over there.  His immediate thought was, what is it? First thought was maybe a large dog, but as my grandson began to describe it standing all all fours and yet being as tall as his dad''s chest...dog seemed to be out of the question.   I wondered if there are bears in Oklahoma..  We sort of dismissed it but my grandson kept talking about it.  <BR><BR>You would just have to know this 7 year old.  He doesn''t lie about anything.  You can pretty much always believe him. He is a really calm, good kid who just loves 4-wheelers more than anything in life....<BR><BR>Anyway, we couldn''t figure out what it was and his parents are trying to convince my grandson that whatever it was is gone now.... my grandson  said, \"It looked like Harry on Harry and the Hendersons movie but with a bump on it''s head and it wasn''t standing up. He described it as having long hair all over it''s body.  He said it was the color of his hair(blonde) on part of it and dark too. <BR><BR>Well, late tonight, my husband called my son and told him that he knew of a man in Davis, Oklahoma that had written a book about bigfoot and swears that they are in Oklahoma... It sounded ridiculous until my daughter-in-law typed into a search engine on the internet tonight.. bigfoot sightings in oklahoma..  She began to read about them and that''s when my grandson said, \"that''s what I saw except it wasn''t standing up.<BR><BR>Now it''s got us wondering if whatever my grandson saw today, actually lives there and is upset that we have disturbed it all.<BR><BR>I mean what animal would come that close to all that noise of 4-wheelers and people and cars and a barking Jack Russell dog? It was approx. 7:00pm when this happened today and still light outside.<BR><BR>I don''t know what to make of it except my grandson saw something that scared him bad, so much so that he refuses to do his most favorite thing....ride the 4-wheelers at Papa and Nanas." 1}, :cardinality 98}, :environment {:data-type "string", :distinct 477, :group-by? true, :commons {nil 22, "Forest" 3, "A lot of brush and pricker bushes and fallen trees.

and I were fishing at Doris Lake near dusk.  Doris Lake is roughly a mile and a half hike from the resort of Mono.  Nothing unusual was happening and then out of nowhere, we heard a scream come from across the lake and up in the Mountians.  There were no people or animals that we could see anywhere.  We were in the proverbial wilderness.  My brother and I looked at each other, and unable to readily discern what we were hearing we continued to fish.  I did say to him, if I hear that again I am out of here. Well, a minute or so later, the same scream.  The three of us immediately reeled in and began to run all the way back to the resort, without stopping.  <BR><BR>I have listened to various recordings of alleged Bigfoot, and I am struck by how similar these recordings are to the scream that we heard.  I did not see anything, so I cant be sure, but I am fairly certian what I heard was not a human, bear or mountian lion.  So....what could it be?<BR><BR>Note:  my brother and sister worked for several years at Mono Hot Springs.

Actually in Fresno. The area is mostly farm land and some sparse woods and vineyards. nothing like foresty though. My self, my cousin and a friend had decided to go late night fishing at a little area on the river where the river sort of pools. Their is a bridge there. It was late and we were sitting there and fishing when we heard something making noise and looked back and saw a coyote running across the bridge heading north. The coyote kept looking back as it ran as if it was frightened.The coyote looked at us but it was clearly focused on something behind it and it was scared. We thought at that time that that was odd. We then heard what we thought was a splash as if someone had dove into the water behind us. It was dark so we just glanced back but of course saw nothing. We probably sat for about 10 minutes or so when suddenly there was a huge goosh and splash about 25 yards away in front of us. We stopped fishing and then tried looking into the darkness.This small boulder throwing continued at least 2 more times before we actually saw a dark figure about 40 yards away standing what looked about waist high in the river. Their was a full moon so it wasn''t to dark to see that it was a pretty big creature. By this time we were starting to get scared and were pretty much froze in place and had began to yell at it, thinking that it could be a person. This prompted my friend to yell threats of violence as young people are sometime prone to do, this creature basically turned it''s whole body to the right of it and grapped another boulder and with both hands over its head it threw it at us, this one landed about 15 yards away. It made no sound or noise only threw small boulders. It threw about 2 more boulders the last landing about 5 yards from us enough to splash water on our faces. By this time we had reeled in our lines and were trying to get out of there as fast as we could. We ran all the way back to the car which was through some trees across a field and up a hill. We went back the next day to the area and on rafts floated to the area where the creature had stood. My friend is about 6 foot tall and jumped in the water to see about how deep it was. The water came to his shoulders. Their was no way this was a man. We even saw some of the boulders that had been thrown at the bottom of the water as it wasn''t more then 5 1/2 feet deep. Their was a sand bar and the boulders were at least 30 to 40 lbs.

While back packing in along the forestry trail leading down to the river, we missed a trail marker and wound up at night along the canyon rim.  We made camp on a bluff slightly below the canyon rim.  I didn''t sleep well that night.  I had a feeling I was being watched and was uneasy. Breaking camp the next morning, Van went for water coming from an artesian spring in the wall of the canyon.  He found one very clear bigfoot footprint in the wet sand below the spring, about 80 feet from where we''d camped.  He called to me to come over and see.  My first reaction was this was a hoax.  Van and I examined the footprint in detail.  It was about 17 inches in length, with 5 clear toes and pressed down about 2 1/2 inches in the sand.  There was a musty smell in the area but this wasn''t overpowering.  Van concluded the print was real based upon the fact it had rained hard the previous morning and you could see the pattern of the rain drops on the surface of the sand except where the footprint was.  Also whatever had the print may very well be slightly above us at the end of the bluff in some rock outcroppings.  He suggested we get out of there while the getting was good.  Van had grown up in Minnesota hunting and fishing with his dad and brothers.  I decided we should take his advice.  We left and back tracked to Van''s Toyota Landcruiser.  We went over to Bass lake to fish for the rest of the weekend.", :environment "This area is around 4500 to 5000 feet in altitude and is covered primarily with conifer forest with some very heavy underbrush in areas.

It was late afternoon when we noticed a strong odor that we thought might be elk so we headed east toward a small ridge hoping to find one on the other side.  As we got closer we heard the noise of rocks being banged together.  As we topped the ridge we saw a large dark brown animal squatting at the edge of a dry creek bed with it''s back toward us. It was banging 2 rocks together with it''s \"hands\" and making a grunting/growling noise each time the  rocks hit.<BR><BR>It seemed to sense our presence almost immediately and turned around and looked at us.  Then it quickly stood up and jumped across the creek in one motion.  I remember thinking \"nothing can move like that!\".  It ran up the slope on the north side of the creek bed at an angle and disappeared into the pine and aspen trees farther up the hill.  We could see it for about 50 feet before it was gone from sight.  It moved real quietly for something that big.<BR><BR>I estimate it''s height as 6''5''''.  It was covered with long dark brown hair that made me think of a yak.  It had a strong smell, at least there was a strong smell in the area that was like elk urine.<BR><BR>After we calmed down a bit, we went into the creek bed and found the 2 rocks which were chipped and broken.  We looked for other signs in that place but couldn''t find anything else." 1, " I was working in the northern part of New Mexico training to be a Wildland Fire Fighter. In September 2003 (maybe the second week of that month) I was dispatched with 22 other people to the Del Loma Fire in the Shasta/Trinity Forest area, the Northern part of California. Each Crew had about 20 people, our plane that left Albuquerque held 2 crews. For almost the whole two weeks, we were all on standby. On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire. It was close to sun down when, a couple of guys were amazed at something. I heard them from inside my tent, but just ignored the whole thing until one of my crew members came and pulled me out of my tent. <BR><BR>I had no idea what I was supposed to be looking at or for. He pointed across the river and I was in shock when he pointed out the biggest, hairiest mammal I had ever seen just walking along the river side minding his own business. It stopped and looked at us. The way he stood on his hind legs was like an ordinary human. He had dark, long hair and stood about 7ft tall with a muscular build. <BR><BR>At this point I was the 4th person standing there in amazement. Maybe about 5 minutes of watching him watch us, with more people coming out with flashlights (because the sun was still going down) he darted in to the trees. He was running, taking long strides, and was gone in about 3 seconds.....and was literally pushing trees out of his way (not breaking them, but  pushing them out of his way). The trees behind him on his path up the mountain were swaying back and forth. I was surprised to see to these trees moving because they are thick in width and very tall. <BR><BR>By this time it was dark but lit enough to see which way he was headed. Up the mountain a little, there was a clearing, where we spotted him again before he disappeared for good. He made no noise, no yelling or screaming. He was just as timid as can be.<BR><BR>I have heard many stories about Bigfoot, and known that they are real but when seeing one in real life....you get a sense of respect for them and just have that feeling that there is more to life than you know. <BR><BR><BR><BR>" 1}, :cardinality 99}, :environment {:data-type "string", :distinct 449, :group-by?

It was late afternoon when we noticed a strong odor that we thought might be elk so we headed east toward a small ridge hoping to find one on the other side.  As we got closer we heard the noise of rocks being banged together.  As we topped the ridge we saw a large dark brown animal squatting at the edge of a dry creek bed with it''s back toward us. It was banging 2 rocks together with it''s \"hands\" and making a grunting/growling noise each time the  rocks hit.<BR><BR>It seemed to sense our presence almost immediately and turned around and looked at us.  Then it quickly stood up and jumped across the creek in one motion.  I remember thinking \"nothing can move like that!\".  It ran up the slope on the north side of the creek bed at an angle and disappeared into the pine and aspen trees farther up the hill.  We could see it for about 50 feet before it was gone from sight.  It moved real quietly for something that big.<BR><BR>I estimate it''s height as 6''5''''.  It was covered with long dark brown hair that made me think of a yak.  It had a strong smell, at least there was a strong smell in the area that was like elk urine.<BR><BR>After we calmed down a bit, we went into the creek bed and found the 2 rocks which were chipped and broken.  We looked for other signs in that place but couldn''t find anything else." 1, " I was working in the northern part of New Mexico training to be a Wildland Fire Fighter. In September 2003 (maybe the second week of that month) I was dispatched with 22 other people to the Del Loma Fire in the Shasta/Trinity Forest area, the Northern part of California. Each Crew had about 20 people, our plane that left Albuquerque held 2 crews. For almost the whole two weeks, we were all on standby. On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire. It was close to sun down when, a couple of guys were amazed at something. I heard them from inside my tent, but just ignored the whole thing until one of my crew members came and pulled me out of my tent. <BR><BR>I had no idea what I was supposed to be looking at or for. He pointed across the river and I was in shock when he pointed out the biggest, hairiest mammal I had ever seen just walking along the river side minding his own business. It stopped and looked at us. The way he stood on his hind legs was like an ordinary human. He had dark, long hair and stood about 7ft tall with a muscular build. <BR><BR>At this point I was the 4th person standing there in amazement. Maybe about 5 minutes of watching him watch us, with more people coming out with flashlights (because the sun was still going down) he darted in to the trees. He was running, taking long strides, and was gone in about 3 seconds.....and was literally pushing trees out of his way (not breaking them, but  pushing them out of his way). The trees behind him on his path up the mountain were swaying back and forth. I was surprised to see to these trees moving because they are thick in width and very tall. <BR><BR>By this time it was dark but lit enough to see which way he was headed. Up the mountain a little, there was a clearing, where we spotted him again before he disappeared for good. He made no noise, no yelling or screaming. He was just as timid as can be.<BR><BR>I have heard many stories about Bigfoot, and known that they are real but when seeing one in real life....you get a sense of respect for them and just have that feeling that there is more to life than you know. <BR><BR><BR><BR>" 1}, :cardinality 99}, :environment {:data-type "string", :distinct 449, :group-by? true, :commons {nil 41, "Pine forest" 6, "Forest" 3}, :cardinality 89}, :fixed_year {:data-type "string", :distinct 77, :group-by? true, :commons {"2001" 30, "2000" 25, "1998" 23}, :cardinality 15}, :run_time {:data-type "string", :distinct 187, :group-by? true, :commons {"2022-05-20 16:15:54.000000" 4, "2022-05-20 16:15:30.000000" 4, "2022-05-20 16:14:33.000000" 4}, :cardinality 37}}, :rowcount 500}, :country-drag-382 {:fields {:country {:data-type "string", :distinct 6, :group-by? true, :commons {"us" 29, nil 24, "ca" 23}, :cardinality 4}, :shape {:data-type "string", :distinct 30, :group-by? true, :commons {"formation" 6, "rectangle" 6, "circle" 6}, :cardinality 21}, :rowcnt {:data-type "integer", :distinct 95, :group-by? false, :commons {1 13, 10 6, 9 6}, :cardinality 68}}, :rowcount 139}, :ufo-sightings-drag-67 {:fields {:duration_seconds_int {:data-type "integer", :distinct 54, :group-by? true, :commons {120 42, 300 38, 60 33}, :cardinality 10}, :comments {:data-type "string", :distinct 500, :group-by? true, :commons {"A green light flew up into the sky&#44 moved left&#44 and descended." 1, "Craft landing on Mt.

It was late afternoon when we noticed a strong odor that we thought might be elk so we headed east toward a small ridge hoping to find one on the other side.  As we got closer we heard the noise of rocks being banged together.  As we topped the ridge we saw a large dark brown animal squatting at the edge of a dry creek bed with it''s back toward us. It was banging 2 rocks together with it''s \"hands\" and making a grunting/growling noise each time the  rocks hit.<BR><BR>It seemed to sense our presence almost immediately and turned around and looked at us.  Then it quickly stood up and jumped across the creek in one motion.  I remember thinking \"nothing can move like that!\".  It ran up the slope on the north side of the creek bed at an angle and disappeared into the pine and aspen trees farther up the hill.  We could see it for about 50 feet before it was gone from sight.  It moved real quietly for something that big.<BR><BR>I estimate it''s height as 6''5''''.  It was covered with long dark brown hair that made me think of a yak.  It had a strong smell, at least there was a strong smell in the area that was like elk urine.<BR><BR>After we calmed down a bit, we went into the creek bed and found the 2 rocks which were chipped and broken.  We looked for other signs in that place but couldn''t find anything else." 1, " I was working in the northern part of New Mexico training to be a Wildland Fire Fighter. In September 2003 (maybe the second week of that month) I was dispatched with 22 other people to the Del Loma Fire in the Shasta/Trinity Forest area, the Northern part of California. Each Crew had about 20 people, our plane that left Albuquerque held 2 crews. For almost the whole two weeks, we were all on standby. On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire. It was close to sun down when, a couple of guys were amazed at something. I heard them from inside my tent, but just ignored the whole thing until one of my crew members came and pulled me out of my tent. <BR><BR>I had no idea what I was supposed to be looking at or for. He pointed across the river and I was in shock when he pointed out the biggest, hairiest mammal I had ever seen just walking along the river side minding his own business. It stopped and looked at us. The way he stood on his hind legs was like an ordinary human. He had dark, long hair and stood about 7ft tall with a muscular build. <BR><BR>At this point I was the 4th person standing there in amazement. Maybe about 5 minutes of watching him watch us, with more people coming out with flashlights (because the sun was still going down) he darted in to the trees. He was running, taking long strides, and was gone in about 3 seconds.....and was literally pushing trees out of his way (not breaking them, but  pushing them out of his way). The trees behind him on his path up the mountain were swaying back and forth. I was surprised to see to these trees moving because they are thick in width and very tall. <BR><BR>By this time it was dark but lit enough to see which way he was headed. Up the mountain a little, there was a clearing, where we spotted him again before he disappeared for good. He made no noise, no yelling or screaming. He was just as timid as can be.<BR><BR>I have heard many stories about Bigfoot, and known that they are real but when seeing one in real life....you get a sense of respect for them and just have that feeling that there is more to life than you know. <BR><BR><BR><BR>" 1}, :cardinality 99}, :environment {:data-type "string", :distinct 449, :group-by?

On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire.

As we got closer we heard the noise of rocks being banged together.  As we topped the ridge we saw a large dark brown animal squatting at the edge of a dry creek bed with it''s back toward us. It was banging 2 rocks together with it''s \"hands\" and making a grunting/growling noise each time the  rocks hit.<BR><BR>It seemed to sense our presence almost immediately and turned around and looked at us.  Then it quickly stood up and jumped across the creek in one motion.  I remember thinking \"nothing can move like that!\".  It ran up the slope on the north side of the creek bed at an angle and disappeared into the pine and aspen trees farther up the hill.  We could see it for about 50 feet before it was gone from sight.  It moved real quietly for something that big.<BR><BR>I estimate it''s height as 6''5''''.  It was covered with long dark brown hair that made me think of a yak.  It had a strong smell, at least there was a strong smell in the area that was like elk urine.<BR><BR>After we calmed down a bit, we went into the creek bed and found the 2 rocks which were chipped and broken.

Each Crew had about 20 people, our plane that left Albuquerque held 2 crews. For almost the whole two weeks, we were all on standby. On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire. It was close to sun down when, a couple of guys were amazed at something. I heard them from inside my tent, but just ignored the whole thing until one of my crew members came and pulled me out of my tent. <BR><BR>I had no idea what I was supposed to be looking at or for. He pointed across the river and I was in shock when he pointed out the biggest, hairiest mammal I had ever seen just walking along the river side minding his own business.

Anyhow I was figuring that I was north of rt 78 and just kind of \"Lewis and Clarked\" it toward home via the mirror compass in my car and made the first left southbound that I could once I realized I was heading west and didn''t recognize any landmarks. <BR><BR>I turn down this road and notice some construction equipment not far off into the trees on the right side of the road. I was driving slower than normal being unfarmiliar with the area and since I kept peeking at the compass to make sure I was still southbound (looking back it must have been overcast since I would have just used the location of the sun as a reference to direction).<BR>As I was driving along I caught movement out of the corner of my eye and saw a young deer (judging by size) bolt out of the trees across the road from left to right about 100-200 feet in front of my car. I just took my foot off the gas and didn''t need to brake, then I looked left for followers and saw what appeard to be a hunter in a dark colored ghillie suit burst from the trees after the deer. I couldnt make out any details of the face feet or hands but he/it was only around 6 feet tall or so and I''d estimate the low 200lb range but was unusually fast especially for someone dressed like that. The second thought in my head since I fish and shoot a bit was that it couldn''t possibly be legal to hunt around that area since its fairly close to residential zones. Then I noticed that the hunter had no weapons in his hands. I got up to the spot where they crossed and looked right and noticed that the biped (hunter) actually closed ground on the deer and was still in pursuit. I don''t know if the deer stopped to look back at some point as they some times do but this thing was in a full tilt sprint over what I would assume to be uneven ground and didn''t stumble once. I didn''t hear or smell anything since I had my roof up and AC & radio on at the time. All of this happened I would estimate in less than 20 seconds total." 1, " First of all, we are staying at a park that has a winding deep creek at the back of 16 + acres.. anyway today my grandchildren and their parents came out to the park to see us.  The children''s parents recently bought them 4-wheelers and this is approx. the 4th time they have come to the park to ride them...<BR><BR>Today was just like every other time they have come out to ride them. We drive our vehicles about 1/8 mile away from the actual park grounds and that''s where the kids and adults ride the 4-wheelers.  We all rode back there for hours... We were making alot of noise of course with 3 children and 4 adults.  Even the owner drove back there in his pickup and stayed awhile... All I am saying is there was alot of noise and I had my Jack Russell Terrier, with me.<BR><BR>I came back to the park area along with my husband about 6:30p.m. The kids and their parents continued to stay out there and ride.  I got a call from my son.  He told me that my 7 year old grandson had just encountered some type of large animal.  He said that he wasn''t sure what it was but said it was big and looked sort of like a monkey with long hair all over it and had a bump on it''s head. He said it wasn''t running.  It scared him half to death and he looked behind him at his dad yelled for his help.  My son went on to say that he immediately sped up to where my grandson was and knew immediately something was wrong by the sound of his scream. He immediately got to where my grandson was on the 4-wheeler. He said that it was as if a limb had been pulled way back on a tree and then let go.  It was still moving when he got over there.  His immediate thought was, what is it? First thought was maybe a large dog, but as my grandson began to describe it standing all all fours and yet being as tall as his dad''s chest...dog seemed to be out of the question.   I wondered if there are bears in Oklahoma..  We sort of dismissed it but my grandson kept talking about it.  <BR><BR>You would just have to know this 7 year old.  He doesn''t lie about anything.  You can pretty much always believe him. He is a really calm, good kid who just loves 4-wheelers more than anything in life....<BR><BR>Anyway, we couldn''t figure out what it was and his parents are trying to convince my grandson that whatever it was is gone now.... my grandson  said, \"It looked like Harry on Harry and the Hendersons movie but with a bump on it''s head and it wasn''t standing up. He described it as having long hair all over it''s body.  He said it was the color of his hair(blonde) on part of it and dark too. <BR><BR>Well, late tonight, my husband called my son and told him that he knew of a man in Davis, Oklahoma that had written a book about bigfoot and swears that they are in Oklahoma... It sounded ridiculous until my daughter-in-law typed into a search engine on the internet tonight.. bigfoot sightings in oklahoma..  She began to read about them and that''s when my grandson said, \"that''s what I saw except it wasn''t standing up.<BR><BR>Now it''s got us wondering if whatever my grandson saw today, actually lives there and is upset that we have disturbed it all.<BR><BR>I mean what animal would come that close to all that noise of 4-wheelers and people and cars and a barking Jack Russell dog? It was approx. 7:00pm when this happened today and still light outside.<BR><BR>I don''t know what to make of it except my grandson saw something that scared him bad, so much so that he refuses to do his most favorite thing....ride the 4-wheelers at Papa and Nanas." 1}, :cardinality 98}, :environment {:data-type "string", :distinct 477, :group-by? true, :commons {nil 22, "Forest" 3, "A lot of brush and pricker bushes and fallen trees.

and I were fishing at Doris Lake near dusk.  Doris Lake is roughly a mile and a half hike from the resort of Mono.  Nothing unusual was happening and then out of nowhere, we heard a scream come from across the lake and up in the Mountians.  There were no people or animals that we could see anywhere.  We were in the proverbial wilderness.  My brother and I looked at each other, and unable to readily discern what we were hearing we continued to fish.  I did say to him, if I hear that again I am out of here. Well, a minute or so later, the same scream.  The three of us immediately reeled in and began to run all the way back to the resort, without stopping.  <BR><BR>I have listened to various recordings of alleged Bigfoot, and I am struck by how similar these recordings are to the scream that we heard.  I did not see anything, so I cant be sure, but I am fairly certian what I heard was not a human, bear or mountian lion.  So....what could it be?<BR><BR>Note:  my brother and sister worked for several years at Mono Hot Springs.

Actually in Fresno. The area is mostly farm land and some sparse woods and vineyards. nothing like foresty though. My self, my cousin and a friend had decided to go late night fishing at a little area on the river where the river sort of pools. Their is a bridge there. It was late and we were sitting there and fishing when we heard something making noise and looked back and saw a coyote running across the bridge heading north. The coyote kept looking back as it ran as if it was frightened.The coyote looked at us but it was clearly focused on something behind it and it was scared. We thought at that time that that was odd. We then heard what we thought was a splash as if someone had dove into the water behind us. It was dark so we just glanced back but of course saw nothing. We probably sat for about 10 minutes or so when suddenly there was a huge goosh and splash about 25 yards away in front of us. We stopped fishing and then tried looking into the darkness.This small boulder throwing continued at least 2 more times before we actually saw a dark figure about 40 yards away standing what looked about waist high in the river. Their was a full moon so it wasn''t to dark to see that it was a pretty big creature. By this time we were starting to get scared and were pretty much froze in place and had began to yell at it, thinking that it could be a person. This prompted my friend to yell threats of violence as young people are sometime prone to do, this creature basically turned it''s whole body to the right of it and grapped another boulder and with both hands over its head it threw it at us, this one landed about 15 yards away. It made no sound or noise only threw small boulders. It threw about 2 more boulders the last landing about 5 yards from us enough to splash water on our faces. By this time we had reeled in our lines and were trying to get out of there as fast as we could. We ran all the way back to the car which was through some trees across a field and up a hill. We went back the next day to the area and on rafts floated to the area where the creature had stood. My friend is about 6 foot tall and jumped in the water to see about how deep it was. The water came to his shoulders. Their was no way this was a man. We even saw some of the boulders that had been thrown at the bottom of the water as it wasn''t more then 5 1/2 feet deep. Their was a sand bar and the boulders were at least 30 to 40 lbs.

While back packing in along the forestry trail leading down to the river, we missed a trail marker and wound up at night along the canyon rim.  We made camp on a bluff slightly below the canyon rim.  I didn''t sleep well that night.  I had a feeling I was being watched and was uneasy. Breaking camp the next morning, Van went for water coming from an artesian spring in the wall of the canyon.  He found one very clear bigfoot footprint in the wet sand below the spring, about 80 feet from where we''d camped.  He called to me to come over and see.  My first reaction was this was a hoax.  Van and I examined the footprint in detail.  It was about 17 inches in length, with 5 clear toes and pressed down about 2 1/2 inches in the sand.  There was a musty smell in the area but this wasn''t overpowering.  Van concluded the print was real based upon the fact it had rained hard the previous morning and you could see the pattern of the rain drops on the surface of the sand except where the footprint was.  Also whatever had the print may very well be slightly above us at the end of the bluff in some rock outcroppings.  He suggested we get out of there while the getting was good.  Van had grown up in Minnesota hunting and fishing with his dad and brothers.  I decided we should take his advice.  We left and back tracked to Van''s Toyota Landcruiser.  We went over to Bass lake to fish for the rest of the weekend.", :environment "This area is around 4500 to 5000 feet in altitude and is covered primarily with conifer forest with some very heavy underbrush in areas.

There was snow on the ground and it was freezing outside.  My mother has a habit of looking out the bathroom window early in the morning.  On this cold winter morning, with the landscaped dressed in a blanket of white and without any visible signs of being touched by human or animal footprints, she saw what looked like 3 very large humanoid footprints. It was so strange that my mother made me get up to take a look.  We put our coats on and went outside to investigate.  We couldn''t believe our eyes.  There in the snow were 3 very, very large humanoid footprints.  We couldn''t figure out where they came from or where they went.  It literally looked as it came from no where and went no where, because the footprints did not leave a trail.  The footprints were so large I could almost stand in it.  You could literally see the 5 toes with foot and toe imprints in the snow.  We couldn''t believe what we were seeing.

Anyhow I was figuring that I was north of rt 78 and just kind of \"Lewis and Clarked\" it toward home via the mirror compass in my car and made the first left southbound that I could once I realized I was heading west and didn''t recognize any landmarks. <BR><BR>I turn down this road and notice some construction equipment not far off into the trees on the right side of the road. I was driving slower than normal being unfarmiliar with the area and since I kept peeking at the compass to make sure I was still southbound (looking back it must have been overcast since I would have just used the location of the sun as a reference to direction).<BR>As I was driving along I caught movement out of the corner of my eye and saw a young deer (judging by size) bolt out of the trees across the road from left to right about 100-200 feet in front of my car. I just took my foot off the gas and didn''t need to brake, then I looked left for followers and saw what appeard to be a hunter in a dark colored ghillie suit burst from the trees after the deer. I couldnt make out any details of the face feet or hands but he/it was only around 6 feet tall or so and I''d estimate the low 200lb range but was unusually fast especially for someone dressed like that. The second thought in my head since I fish and shoot a bit was that it couldn''t possibly be legal to hunt around that area since its fairly close to residential zones. Then I noticed that the hunter had no weapons in his hands. I got up to the spot where they crossed and looked right and noticed that the biped (hunter) actually closed ground on the deer and was still in pursuit. I don''t know if the deer stopped to look back at some point as they some times do but this thing was in a full tilt sprint over what I would assume to be uneven ground and didn''t stumble once.

It ran up the slope on the north side of the creek bed at an angle and disappeared into the pine and aspen trees farther up the hill.  We could see it for about 50 feet before it was gone from sight.  It moved real quietly for something that big.<BR><BR>I estimate it''s height as 6''5''''.

In September 2003 (maybe the second week of that month) I was dispatched with 22 other people to the Del Loma Fire in the Shasta/Trinity Forest area, the Northern part of California. Each Crew had about 20 people, our plane that left Albuquerque held 2 crews. For almost the whole two weeks, we were all on standby. On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire. It was close to sun down when, a couple of guys were amazed at something. I heard them from inside my tent, but just ignored the whole thing until one of my crew members came and pulled me out of my tent. <BR><BR>I had no idea what I was supposed to be looking at or for. He pointed across the river and I was in shock when he pointed out the biggest, hairiest mammal I had ever seen just walking along the river side minding his own business. It stopped and looked at us. The way he stood on his hind legs was like an ordinary human. He had dark, long hair and stood about 7ft tall with a muscular build. <BR><BR>At this point I was the 4th person standing there in amazement. Maybe about 5 minutes of watching him watch us, with more people coming out with flashlights (because the sun was still going down) he darted in to the trees. He was running, taking long strides, and was gone in about 3 seconds.....and was literally pushing trees out of his way (not breaking them, but  pushing them out of his way). The trees behind him on his path up the mountain were swaying back and forth. I was surprised to see to these trees moving because they are thick in width and very tall. <BR><BR>By this time it was dark but lit enough to see which way he was headed. Up the mountain a little, there was a clearing, where we spotted him again before he disappeared for good. He made no noise, no yelling or screaming.

On this cold winter morning, with the landscaped dressed in a blanket of white and without any visible signs of being touched by human or animal footprints, she saw what looked like 3 very large humanoid footprints. It was so strange that my mother made me get up to take a look.  We put our coats on and went outside to investigate.  We couldn''t believe our eyes.  There in the snow were 3 very, very large humanoid footprints.  We couldn''t figure out where they came from or where they went.  It literally looked as it came from no where and went no where, because the footprints did not leave a trail.  The footprints were so large I could almost stand in it.  You could literally see the 5 toes with foot and toe imprints in the snow.  We couldn''t believe what we were seeing.  Who or what has a foot that big and who or what would be out in this weather barefooted.<BR><BR>" 1, " April 29 2006 about 630pm I just left the Livingston mall and was heading home but got all turned about since I don''t go up that way very often. Anyhow I was figuring that I was north of rt 78 and just kind of \"Lewis and Clarked\" it toward home via the mirror compass in my car and made the first left southbound that I could once I realized I was heading west and didn''t recognize any landmarks. <BR><BR>I turn down this road and notice some construction equipment not far off into the trees on the right side of the road. I was driving slower than normal being unfarmiliar with the area and since I kept peeking at the compass to make sure I was still southbound (looking back it must have been overcast since I would have just used the location of the sun as a reference to direction).<BR>As I was driving along I caught movement out of the corner of my eye and saw a young deer (judging by size) bolt out of the trees across the road from left to right about 100-200 feet in front of my car. I just took my foot off the gas and didn''t need to brake, then I looked left for followers and saw what appeard to be a hunter in a dark colored ghillie suit burst from the trees after the deer. I couldnt make out any details of the face feet or hands but he/it was only around 6 feet tall or so and I''d estimate the low 200lb range but was unusually fast especially for someone dressed like that. The second thought in my head since I fish and shoot a bit was that it couldn''t possibly be legal to hunt around that area since its fairly close to residential zones. Then I noticed that the hunter had no weapons in his hands. I got up to the spot where they crossed and looked right and noticed that the biped (hunter) actually closed ground on the deer and was still in pursuit. I don''t know if the deer stopped to look back at some point as they some times do but this thing was in a full tilt sprint over what I would assume to be uneven ground and didn''t stumble once. I didn''t hear or smell anything since I had my roof up and AC & radio on at the time.

It was late afternoon when we noticed a strong odor that we thought might be elk so we headed east toward a small ridge hoping to find one on the other side.  As we got closer we heard the noise of rocks being banged together.  As we topped the ridge we saw a large dark brown animal squatting at the edge of a dry creek bed with it''s back toward us. It was banging 2 rocks together with it''s \"hands\" and making a grunting/growling noise each time the  rocks hit.<BR><BR>It seemed to sense our presence almost immediately and turned around and looked at us.  Then it quickly stood up and jumped across the creek in one motion.  I remember thinking \"nothing can move like that!\".  It ran up the slope on the north side of the creek bed at an angle and disappeared into the pine and aspen trees farther up the hill.  We could see it for about 50 feet before it was gone from sight.  It moved real quietly for something that big.<BR><BR>I estimate it''s height as 6''5''''.  It was covered with long dark brown hair that made me think of a yak.  It had a strong smell, at least there was a strong smell in the area that was like elk urine.<BR><BR>After we calmed down a bit, we went into the creek bed and found the 2 rocks which were chipped and broken.  We looked for other signs in that place but couldn''t find anything else." 1, " I was working in the northern part of New Mexico training to be a Wildland Fire Fighter. In September 2003 (maybe the second week of that month) I was dispatched with 22 other people to the Del Loma Fire in the Shasta/Trinity Forest area, the Northern part of California. Each Crew had about 20 people, our plane that left Albuquerque held 2 crews. For almost the whole two weeks, we were all on standby. On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire. It was close to sun down when, a couple of guys were amazed at something. I heard them from inside my tent, but just ignored the whole thing until one of my crew members came and pulled me out of my tent. <BR><BR>I had no idea what I was supposed to be looking at or for. He pointed across the river and I was in shock when he pointed out the biggest, hairiest mammal I had ever seen just walking along the river side minding his own business. It stopped and looked at us. The way he stood on his hind legs was like an ordinary human. He had dark, long hair and stood about 7ft tall with a muscular build. <BR><BR>At this point I was the 4th person standing there in amazement. Maybe about 5 minutes of watching him watch us, with more people coming out with flashlights (because the sun was still going down) he darted in to the trees. He was running, taking long strides, and was gone in about 3 seconds.....and was literally pushing trees out of his way (not breaking them, but  pushing them out of his way). The trees behind him on his path up the mountain were swaying back and forth. I was surprised to see to these trees moving because they are thick in width and very tall. <BR><BR>By this time it was dark but lit enough to see which way he was headed. Up the mountain a little, there was a clearing, where we spotted him again before he disappeared for good. He made no noise, no yelling or screaming. He was just as timid as can be.<BR><BR>I have heard many stories about Bigfoot, and known that they are real but when seeing one in real life....you get a sense of respect for them and just have that feeling that there is more to life than you know. <BR><BR><BR><BR>" 1}, :cardinality 99}, :environment {:data-type "string", :distinct 449, :group-by?

Anyhow I was figuring that I was north of rt 78 and just kind of \"Lewis and Clarked\" it toward home via the mirror compass in my car and made the first left southbound that I could once I realized I was heading west and didn''t recognize any landmarks. <BR><BR>I turn down this road and notice some construction equipment not far off into the trees on the right side of the road. I was driving slower than normal being unfarmiliar with the area and since I kept peeking at the compass to make sure I was still southbound (looking back it must have been overcast since I would have just used the location of the sun as a reference to direction).<BR>As I was driving along I caught movement out of the corner of my eye and saw a young deer (judging by size) bolt out of the trees across the road from left to right about 100-200 feet in front of my car. I just took my foot off the gas and didn''t need to brake, then I looked left for followers and saw what appeard to be a hunter in a dark colored ghillie suit burst from the trees after the deer. I couldnt make out any details of the face feet or hands but he/it was only around 6 feet tall or so and I''d estimate the low 200lb range but was unusually fast especially for someone dressed like that. The second thought in my head since I fish and shoot a bit was that it couldn''t possibly be legal to hunt around that area since its fairly close to residential zones. Then I noticed that the hunter had no weapons in his hands. I got up to the spot where they crossed and looked right and noticed that the biped (hunter) actually closed ground on the deer and was still in pursuit. I don''t know if the deer stopped to look back at some point as they some times do but this thing was in a full tilt sprint over what I would assume to be uneven ground and didn''t stumble once. I didn''t hear or smell anything since I had my roof up and AC & radio on at the time. All of this happened I would estimate in less than 20 seconds total." 1, " First of all, we are staying at a park that has a winding deep creek at the back of 16 + acres.. anyway today my grandchildren and their parents came out to the park to see us.  The children''s parents recently bought them 4-wheelers and this is approx. the 4th time they have come to the park to ride them...<BR><BR>Today was just like every other time they have come out to ride them. We drive our vehicles about 1/8 mile away from the actual park grounds and that''s where the kids and adults ride the 4-wheelers.  We all rode back there for hours... We were making alot of noise of course with 3 children and 4 adults.  Even the owner drove back there in his pickup and stayed awhile... All I am saying is there was alot of noise and I had my Jack Russell Terrier, with me.<BR><BR>I came back to the park area along with my husband about 6:30p.m. The kids and their parents continued to stay out there and ride.  I got a call from my son.  He told me that my 7 year old grandson had just encountered some type of large animal.  He said that he wasn''t sure what it was but said it was big and looked sort of like a monkey with long hair all over it and had a bump on it''s head. He said it wasn''t running.  It scared him half to death and he looked behind him at his dad yelled for his help.  My son went on to say that he immediately sped up to where my grandson was and knew immediately something was wrong by the sound of his scream. He immediately got to where my grandson was on the 4-wheeler. He said that it was as if a limb had been pulled way back on a tree and then let go.  It was still moving when he got over there.  His immediate thought was, what is it? First thought was maybe a large dog, but as my grandson began to describe it standing all all fours and yet being as tall as his dad''s chest...dog seemed to be out of the question.   I wondered if there are bears in Oklahoma..  We sort of dismissed it but my grandson kept talking about it.  <BR><BR>You would just have to know this 7 year old.  He doesn''t lie about anything.  You can pretty much always believe him. He is a really calm, good kid who just loves 4-wheelers more than anything in life....<BR><BR>Anyway, we couldn''t figure out what it was and his parents are trying to convince my grandson that whatever it was is gone now.... my grandson  said, \"It looked like Harry on Harry and the Hendersons movie but with a bump on it''s head and it wasn''t standing up. He described it as having long hair all over it''s body.  He said it was the color of his hair(blonde) on part of it and dark too. <BR><BR>Well, late tonight, my husband called my son and told him that he knew of a man in Davis, Oklahoma that had written a book about bigfoot and swears that they are in Oklahoma... It sounded ridiculous until my daughter-in-law typed into a search engine on the internet tonight.. bigfoot sightings in oklahoma..  She began to read about them and that''s when my grandson said, \"that''s what I saw except it wasn''t standing up.<BR><BR>Now it''s got us wondering if whatever my grandson saw today, actually lives there and is upset that we have disturbed it all.<BR><BR>I mean what animal would come that close to all that noise of 4-wheelers and people and cars and a barking Jack Russell dog? It was approx. 7:00pm when this happened today and still light outside.<BR><BR>I don''t know what to make of it except my grandson saw something that scared him bad, so much so that he refuses to do his most favorite thing....ride the 4-wheelers at Papa and Nanas." 1}, :cardinality 98}, :environment {:data-type "string", :distinct 477, :group-by? true, :commons {nil 22, "Forest" 3, "A lot of brush and pricker bushes and fallen trees.

My story of Bigfoot was not visual but rather we heard a scream in the deep forest that we could not explain.  <BR><BR>The location was in the area of Mono Hot Springs, in the Sierra Nevada''s in California, specifically, the John Muir Wilderness.  <BR><BR>My brother friend and I were fishing at Doris Lake near dusk.  Doris Lake is roughly a mile and a half hike from the resort of Mono.  Nothing unusual was happening and then out of nowhere, we heard a scream come from across the lake and up in the Mountians.  There were no people or animals that we could see anywhere.  We were in the proverbial wilderness.  My brother and I looked at each other, and unable to readily discern what we were hearing we continued to fish.  I did say to him, if I hear that again I am out of here. Well, a minute or so later, the same scream.  The three of us immediately reeled in and began to run all the way back to the resort, without stopping.  <BR><BR>I have listened to various recordings of alleged Bigfoot, and I am struck by how similar these recordings are to the scream that we heard.  I did not see anything, so I cant be sure, but I am fairly certian what I heard was not a human, bear or mountian lion.  So....what could it be?<BR><BR>Note:  my brother and sister worked for several years at Mono Hot Springs.

Actually in Fresno. The area is mostly farm land and some sparse woods and vineyards. nothing like foresty though. My self, my cousin and a friend had decided to go late night fishing at a little area on the river where the river sort of pools. Their is a bridge there. It was late and we were sitting there and fishing when we heard something making noise and looked back and saw a coyote running across the bridge heading north. The coyote kept looking back as it ran as if it was frightened.The coyote looked at us but it was clearly focused on something behind it and it was scared. We thought at that time that that was odd. We then heard what we thought was a splash as if someone had dove into the water behind us. It was dark so we just glanced back but of course saw nothing. We probably sat for about 10 minutes or so when suddenly there was a huge goosh and splash about 25 yards away in front of us. We stopped fishing and then tried looking into the darkness.This small boulder throwing continued at least 2 more times before we actually saw a dark figure about 40 yards away standing what looked about waist high in the river. Their was a full moon so it wasn''t to dark to see that it was a pretty big creature. By this time we were starting to get scared and were pretty much froze in place and had began to yell at it, thinking that it could be a person. This prompted my friend to yell threats of violence as young people are sometime prone to do, this creature basically turned it''s whole body to the right of it and grapped another boulder and with both hands over its head it threw it at us, this one landed about 15 yards away. It made no sound or noise only threw small boulders. It threw about 2 more boulders the last landing about 5 yards from us enough to splash water on our faces. By this time we had reeled in our lines and were trying to get out of there as fast as we could. We ran all the way back to the car which was through some trees across a field and up a hill. We went back the next day to the area and on rafts floated to the area where the creature had stood. My friend is about 6 foot tall and jumped in the water to see about how deep it was. The water came to his shoulders. Their was no way this was a man. We even saw some of the boulders that had been thrown at the bottom of the water as it wasn''t more then 5 1/2 feet deep. Their was a sand bar and the boulders were at least 30 to 40 lbs.

While back packing in along the forestry trail leading down to the river, we missed a trail marker and wound up at night along the canyon rim.  We made camp on a bluff slightly below the canyon rim.  I didn''t sleep well that night.  I had a feeling I was being watched and was uneasy. Breaking camp the next morning, Van went for water coming from an artesian spring in the wall of the canyon.  He found one very clear bigfoot footprint in the wet sand below the spring, about 80 feet from where we''d camped.  He called to me to come over and see.  My first reaction was this was a hoax.  Van and I examined the footprint in detail.  It was about 17 inches in length, with 5 clear toes and pressed down about 2 1/2 inches in the sand.  There was a musty smell in the area but this wasn''t overpowering.  Van concluded the print was real based upon the fact it had rained hard the previous morning and you could see the pattern of the rain drops on the surface of the sand except where the footprint was.  Also whatever had the print may very well be slightly above us at the end of the bluff in some rock outcroppings.  He suggested we get out of there while the getting was good.  Van had grown up in Minnesota hunting and fishing with his dad and brothers.  I decided we should take his advice.  We left and back tracked to Van''s Toyota Landcruiser.  We went over to Bass lake to fish for the rest of the weekend.", :environment "This area is around 4500 to 5000 feet in altitude and is covered primarily with conifer forest with some very heavy underbrush in areas.

There was snow on the ground and it was freezing outside.  My mother has a habit of looking out the bathroom window early in the morning.  On this cold winter morning, with the landscaped dressed in a blanket of white and without any visible signs of being touched by human or animal footprints, she saw what looked like 3 very large humanoid footprints. It was so strange that my mother made me get up to take a look.  We put our coats on and went outside to investigate.  We couldn''t believe our eyes.  There in the snow were 3 very, very large humanoid footprints.  We couldn''t figure out where they came from or where they went.  It literally looked as it came from no where and went no where, because the footprints did not leave a trail.  The footprints were so large I could almost stand in it.  You could literally see the 5 toes with foot and toe imprints in the snow.  We couldn''t believe what we were seeing.  Who or what has a foot that big and who or what would be out in this weather barefooted.<BR><BR>" 1, " April 29 2006 about 630pm I just left the Livingston mall and was heading home but got all turned about since I don''t go up that way very often. Anyhow I was figuring that I was north of rt 78 and just kind of \"Lewis and Clarked\" it toward home via the mirror compass in my car and made the first left southbound that I could once I realized I was heading west and didn''t recognize any landmarks. <BR><BR>I turn down this road and notice some construction equipment not far off into the trees on the right side of the road. I was driving slower than normal being unfarmiliar with the area and since I kept peeking at the compass to make sure I was still southbound (looking back it must have been overcast since I would have just used the location of the sun as a reference to direction).<BR>As I was driving along I caught movement out of the corner of my eye and saw a young deer (judging by size) bolt out of the trees across the road from left to right about 100-200 feet in front of my car. I just took my foot off the gas and didn''t need to brake, then I looked left for followers and saw what appeard to be a hunter in a dark colored ghillie suit burst from the trees after the deer. I couldnt make out any details of the face feet or hands but he/it was only around 6 feet tall or so and I''d estimate the low 200lb range but was unusually fast especially for someone dressed like that. The second thought in my head since I fish and shoot a bit was that it couldn''t possibly be legal to hunt around that area since its fairly close to residential zones. Then I noticed that the hunter had no weapons in his hands. I got up to the spot where they crossed and looked right and noticed that the biped (hunter) actually closed ground on the deer and was still in pursuit.

It was late afternoon when we noticed a strong odor that we thought might be elk so we headed east toward a small ridge hoping to find one on the other side.  As we got closer we heard the noise of rocks being banged together.  As we topped the ridge we saw a large dark brown animal squatting at the edge of a dry creek bed with it''s back toward us. It was banging 2 rocks together with it''s \"hands\" and making a grunting/growling noise each time the  rocks hit.<BR><BR>It seemed to sense our presence almost immediately and turned around and looked at us.  Then it quickly stood up and jumped across the creek in one motion.  I remember thinking \"nothing can move like that!\".  It ran up the slope on the north side of the creek bed at an angle and disappeared into the pine and aspen trees farther up the hill.  We could see it for about 50 feet before it was gone from sight.  It moved real quietly for something that big.<BR><BR>I estimate it''s height as 6''5''''.  It was covered with long dark brown hair that made me think of a yak.  It had a strong smell, at least there was a strong smell in the area that was like elk urine.<BR><BR>After we calmed down a bit, we went into the creek bed and found the 2 rocks which were chipped and broken.  We looked for other signs in that place but couldn''t find anything else." 1, " I was working in the northern part of New Mexico training to be a Wildland Fire Fighter. In September 2003 (maybe the second week of that month) I was dispatched with 22 other people to the Del Loma Fire in the Shasta/Trinity Forest area, the Northern part of California. Each Crew had about 20 people, our plane that left Albuquerque held 2 crews. For almost the whole two weeks, we were all on standby. On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire. It was close to sun down when, a couple of guys were amazed at something. I heard them from inside my tent, but just ignored the whole thing until one of my crew members came and pulled me out of my tent. <BR><BR>I had no idea what I was supposed to be looking at or for. He pointed across the river and I was in shock when he pointed out the biggest, hairiest mammal I had ever seen just walking along the river side minding his own business. It stopped and looked at us. The way he stood on his hind legs was like an ordinary human. He had dark, long hair and stood about 7ft tall with a muscular build. <BR><BR>At this point I was the 4th person standing there in amazement. Maybe about 5 minutes of watching him watch us, with more people coming out with flashlights (because the sun was still going down) he darted in to the trees. He was running, taking long strides, and was gone in about 3 seconds.....and was literally pushing trees out of his way (not breaking them, but  pushing them out of his way). The trees behind him on his path up the mountain were swaying back and forth. I was surprised to see to these trees moving because they are thick in width and very tall. <BR><BR>By this time it was dark but lit enough to see which way he was headed. Up the mountain a little, there was a clearing, where we spotted him again before he disappeared for good. He made no noise, no yelling or screaming. He was just as timid as can be.<BR><BR>I have heard many stories about Bigfoot, and known that they are real but when seeing one in real life....you get a sense of respect for them and just have that feeling that there is more to life than you know. <BR><BR><BR><BR>" 1}, :cardinality 99}, :environment {:data-type "string", :distinct 449, :group-by?

On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire.

There was snow on the ground and it was freezing outside.  My mother has a habit of looking out the bathroom window early in the morning.  On this cold winter morning, with the landscaped dressed in a blanket of white and without any visible signs of being touched by human or animal footprints, she saw what looked like 3 very large humanoid footprints. It was so strange that my mother made me get up to take a look.  We put our coats on and went outside to investigate.  We couldn''t believe our eyes.  There in the snow were 3 very, very large humanoid footprints.  We couldn''t figure out where they came from or where they went.  It literally looked as it came from no where and went no where, because the footprints did not leave a trail.  The footprints were so large I could almost stand in it.  You could literally see the 5 toes with foot and toe imprints in the snow.  We couldn''t believe what we were seeing.  Who or what has a foot that big and who or what would be out in this weather barefooted.<BR><BR>" 1, " April 29 2006 about 630pm I just left the Livingston mall and was heading home but got all turned about since I don''t go up that way very often. Anyhow I was figuring that I was north of rt 78 and just kind of \"Lewis and Clarked\" it toward home via the mirror compass in my car and made the first left southbound that I could once I realized I was heading west and didn''t recognize any landmarks. <BR><BR>I turn down this road and notice some construction equipment not far off into the trees on the right side of the road. I was driving slower than normal being unfarmiliar with the area and since I kept peeking at the compass to make sure I was still southbound (looking back it must have been overcast since I would have just used the location of the sun as a reference to direction).<BR>As I was driving along I caught movement out of the corner of my eye and saw a young deer (judging by size) bolt out of the trees across the road from left to right about 100-200 feet in front of my car. I just took my foot off the gas and didn''t need to brake, then I looked left for followers and saw what appeard to be a hunter in a dark colored ghillie suit burst from the trees after the deer. I couldnt make out any details of the face feet or hands but he/it was only around 6 feet tall or so and I''d estimate the low 200lb range but was unusually fast especially for someone dressed like that. The second thought in my head since I fish and shoot a bit was that it couldn''t possibly be legal to hunt around that area since its fairly close to residential zones. Then I noticed that the hunter had no weapons in his hands. I got up to the spot where they crossed and looked right and noticed that the biped (hunter) actually closed ground on the deer and was still in pursuit. I don''t know if the deer stopped to look back at some point as they some times do but this thing was in a full tilt sprint over what I would assume to be uneven ground and didn''t stumble once. I didn''t hear or smell anything since I had my roof up and AC & radio on at the time.

As we got closer we heard the noise of rocks being banged together.  As we topped the ridge we saw a large dark brown animal squatting at the edge of a dry creek bed with it''s back toward us. It was banging 2 rocks together with it''s \"hands\" and making a grunting/growling noise each time the  rocks hit.<BR><BR>It seemed to sense our presence almost immediately and turned around and looked at us.  Then it quickly stood up and jumped across the creek in one motion.  I remember thinking \"nothing can move like that!\".  It ran up the slope on the north side of the creek bed at an angle and disappeared into the pine and aspen trees farther up the hill.  We could see it for about 50 feet before it was gone from sight.  It moved real quietly for something that big.<BR><BR>I estimate it''s height as 6''5''''.  It was covered with long dark brown hair that made me think of a yak.  It had a strong smell, at least there was a strong smell in the area that was like elk urine.<BR><BR>After we calmed down a bit, we went into the creek bed and found the 2 rocks which were chipped and broken.  We looked for other signs in that place but couldn''t find anything else." 1, " I was working in the northern part of New Mexico training to be a Wildland Fire Fighter. In September 2003 (maybe the second week of that month) I was dispatched with 22 other people to the Del Loma Fire in the Shasta/Trinity Forest area, the Northern part of California. Each Crew had about 20 people, our plane that left Albuquerque held 2 crews. For almost the whole two weeks, we were all on standby. On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire. It was close to sun down when, a couple of guys were amazed at something. I heard them from inside my tent, but just ignored the whole thing until one of my crew members came and pulled me out of my tent. <BR><BR>I had no idea what I was supposed to be looking at or for. He pointed across the river and I was in shock when he pointed out the biggest, hairiest mammal I had ever seen just walking along the river side minding his own business. It stopped and looked at us. The way he stood on his hind legs was like an ordinary human. He had dark, long hair and stood about 7ft tall with a muscular build. <BR><BR>At this point I was the 4th person standing there in amazement. Maybe about 5 minutes of watching him watch us, with more people coming out with flashlights (because the sun was still going down) he darted in to the trees. He was running, taking long strides, and was gone in about 3 seconds.....and was literally pushing trees out of his way (not breaking them, but  pushing them out of his way). The trees behind him on his path up the mountain were swaying back and forth. I was surprised to see to these trees moving because they are thick in width and very tall. <BR><BR>By this time it was dark but lit enough to see which way he was headed. Up the mountain a little, there was a clearing, where we spotted him again before he disappeared for good. He made no noise, no yelling or screaming. He was just as timid as can be.<BR><BR>I have heard many stories about Bigfoot, and known that they are real but when seeing one in real life....you get a sense of respect for them and just have that feeling that there is more to life than you know. <BR><BR><BR><BR>" 1}, :cardinality 99}, :environment {:data-type "string", :distinct 449, :group-by?

Anyhow I was figuring that I was north of rt 78 and just kind of \"Lewis and Clarked\" it toward home via the mirror compass in my car and made the first left southbound that I could once I realized I was heading west and didn''t recognize any landmarks. <BR><BR>I turn down this road and notice some construction equipment not far off into the trees on the right side of the road. I was driving slower than normal being unfarmiliar with the area and since I kept peeking at the compass to make sure I was still southbound (looking back it must have been overcast since I would have just used the location of the sun as a reference to direction).<BR>As I was driving along I caught movement out of the corner of my eye and saw a young deer (judging by size) bolt out of the trees across the road from left to right about 100-200 feet in front of my car. I just took my foot off the gas and didn''t need to brake, then I looked left for followers and saw what appeard to be a hunter in a dark colored ghillie suit burst from the trees after the deer. I couldnt make out any details of the face feet or hands but he/it was only around 6 feet tall or so and I''d estimate the low 200lb range but was unusually fast especially for someone dressed like that. The second thought in my head since I fish and shoot a bit was that it couldn''t possibly be legal to hunt around that area since its fairly close to residential zones. Then I noticed that the hunter had no weapons in his hands. I got up to the spot where they crossed and looked right and noticed that the biped (hunter) actually closed ground on the deer and was still in pursuit. I don''t know if the deer stopped to look back at some point as they some times do but this thing was in a full tilt sprint over what I would assume to be uneven ground and didn''t stumble once. I didn''t hear or smell anything since I had my roof up and AC & radio on at the time. All of this happened I would estimate in less than 20 seconds total." 1, " First of all, we are staying at a park that has a winding deep creek at the back of 16 + acres.. anyway today my grandchildren and their parents came out to the park to see us.  The children''s parents recently bought them 4-wheelers and this is approx. the 4th time they have come to the park to ride them...<BR><BR>Today was just like every other time they have come out to ride them. We drive our vehicles about 1/8 mile away from the actual park grounds and that''s where the kids and adults ride the 4-wheelers.  We all rode back there for hours... We were making alot of noise of course with 3 children and 4 adults.  Even the owner drove back there in his pickup and stayed awhile... All I am saying is there was alot of noise and I had my Jack Russell Terrier, with me.<BR><BR>I came back to the park area along with my husband about 6:30p.m. The kids and their parents continued to stay out there and ride.  I got a call from my son.  He told me that my 7 year old grandson had just encountered some type of large animal.  He said that he wasn''t sure what it was but said it was big and looked sort of like a monkey with long hair all over it and had a bump on it''s head. He said it wasn''t running.  It scared him half to death and he looked behind him at his dad yelled for his help.  My son went on to say that he immediately sped up to where my grandson was and knew immediately something was wrong by the sound of his scream. He immediately got to where my grandson was on the 4-wheeler. He said that it was as if a limb had been pulled way back on a tree and then let go.  It was still moving when he got over there.  His immediate thought was, what is it? First thought was maybe a large dog, but as my grandson began to describe it standing all all fours and yet being as tall as his dad''s chest...dog seemed to be out of the question.   I wondered if there are bears in Oklahoma..  We sort of dismissed it but my grandson kept talking about it.  <BR><BR>You would just have to know this 7 year old.  He doesn''t lie about anything.  You can pretty much always believe him. He is a really calm, good kid who just loves 4-wheelers more than anything in life....<BR><BR>Anyway, we couldn''t figure out what it was and his parents are trying to convince my grandson that whatever it was is gone now.... my grandson  said, \"It looked like Harry on Harry and the Hendersons movie but with a bump on it''s head and it wasn''t standing up. He described it as having long hair all over it''s body.  He said it was the color of his hair(blonde) on part of it and dark too. <BR><BR>Well, late tonight, my husband called my son and told him that he knew of a man in Davis, Oklahoma that had written a book about bigfoot and swears that they are in Oklahoma... It sounded ridiculous until my daughter-in-law typed into a search engine on the internet tonight.. bigfoot sightings in oklahoma..  She began to read about them and that''s when my grandson said, \"that''s what I saw except it wasn''t standing up.<BR><BR>Now it''s got us wondering if whatever my grandson saw today, actually lives there and is upset that we have disturbed it all.<BR><BR>I mean what animal would come that close to all that noise of 4-wheelers and people and cars and a barking Jack Russell dog? It was approx. 7:00pm when this happened today and still light outside.<BR><BR>I don''t know what to make of it except my grandson saw something that scared him bad, so much so that he refuses to do his most favorite thing....ride the 4-wheelers at Papa and Nanas." 1}, :cardinality 98}, :environment {:data-type "string", :distinct 477, :group-by? true, :commons {nil 22, "Forest" 3, "A lot of brush and pricker bushes and fallen trees.

My story of Bigfoot was not visual but rather we heard a scream in the deep forest that we could not explain.  <BR><BR>The location was in the area of Mono Hot Springs, in the Sierra Nevada''s in California, specifically, the John Muir Wilderness.  <BR><BR>My brother friend and I were fishing at Doris Lake near dusk.  Doris Lake is roughly a mile and a half hike from the resort of Mono.  Nothing unusual was happening and then out of nowhere, we heard a scream come from across the lake and up in the Mountians.  There were no people or animals that we could see anywhere.  We were in the proverbial wilderness.  My brother and I looked at each other, and unable to readily discern what we were hearing we continued to fish.  I did say to him, if I hear that again I am out of here. Well, a minute or so later, the same scream.  The three of us immediately reeled in and began to run all the way back to the resort, without stopping.  <BR><BR>I have listened to various recordings of alleged Bigfoot, and I am struck by how similar these recordings are to the scream that we heard.  I did not see anything, so I cant be sure, but I am fairly certian what I heard was not a human, bear or mountian lion.  So....what could it be?<BR><BR>Note:  my brother and sister worked for several years at Mono Hot Springs.  My sisters good friend who worked their as well had a horse which she kept in the summer time at the springs. While riding in the back country, she claims to have seen Bigfoot walking through a meadow below a bluff she was riding atop.

Actually in Fresno. The area is mostly farm land and some sparse woods and vineyards. nothing like foresty though. My self, my cousin and a friend had decided to go late night fishing at a little area on the river where the river sort of pools. Their is a bridge there. It was late and we were sitting there and fishing when we heard something making noise and looked back and saw a coyote running across the bridge heading north. The coyote kept looking back as it ran as if it was frightened.The coyote looked at us but it was clearly focused on something behind it and it was scared. We thought at that time that that was odd. We then heard what we thought was a splash as if someone had dove into the water behind us. It was dark so we just glanced back but of course saw nothing. We probably sat for about 10 minutes or so when suddenly there was a huge goosh and splash about 25 yards away in front of us. We stopped fishing and then tried looking into the darkness.This small boulder throwing continued at least 2 more times before we actually saw a dark figure about 40 yards away standing what looked about waist high in the river. Their was a full moon so it wasn''t to dark to see that it was a pretty big creature. By this time we were starting to get scared and were pretty much froze in place and had began to yell at it, thinking that it could be a person. This prompted my friend to yell threats of violence as young people are sometime prone to do, this creature basically turned it''s whole body to the right of it and grapped another boulder and with both hands over its head it threw it at us, this one landed about 15 yards away. It made no sound or noise only threw small boulders. It threw about 2 more boulders the last landing about 5 yards from us enough to splash water on our faces. By this time we had reeled in our lines and were trying to get out of there as fast as we could. We ran all the way back to the car which was through some trees across a field and up a hill. We went back the next day to the area and on rafts floated to the area where the creature had stood. My friend is about 6 foot tall and jumped in the water to see about how deep it was. The water came to his shoulders. Their was no way this was a man. We even saw some of the boulders that had been thrown at the bottom of the water as it wasn''t more then 5 1/2 feet deep. Their was a sand bar and the boulders were at least 30 to 40 lbs.

While back packing in along the forestry trail leading down to the river, we missed a trail marker and wound up at night along the canyon rim.  We made camp on a bluff slightly below the canyon rim.  I didn''t sleep well that night.  I had a feeling I was being watched and was uneasy. Breaking camp the next morning, Van went for water coming from an artesian spring in the wall of the canyon.  He found one very clear bigfoot footprint in the wet sand below the spring, about 80 feet from where we''d camped.  He called to me to come over and see.  My first reaction was this was a hoax.  Van and I examined the footprint in detail.  It was about 17 inches in length, with 5 clear toes and pressed down about 2 1/2 inches in the sand.  There was a musty smell in the area but this wasn''t overpowering.  Van concluded the print was real based upon the fact it had rained hard the previous morning and you could see the pattern of the rain drops on the surface of the sand except where the footprint was.  Also whatever had the print may very well be slightly above us at the end of the bluff in some rock outcroppings.  He suggested we get out of there while the getting was good.  Van had grown up in Minnesota hunting and fishing with his dad and brothers.  I decided we should take his advice.  We left and back tracked to Van''s Toyota Landcruiser.  We went over to Bass lake to fish for the rest of the weekend.", :environment "This area is around 4500 to 5000 feet in altitude and is covered primarily with conifer forest with some very heavy underbrush in areas.

There was snow on the ground and it was freezing outside.  My mother has a habit of looking out the bathroom window early in the morning.  On this cold winter morning, with the landscaped dressed in a blanket of white and without any visible signs of being touched by human or animal footprints, she saw what looked like 3 very large humanoid footprints. It was so strange that my mother made me get up to take a look.  We put our coats on and went outside to investigate.  We couldn''t believe our eyes.  There in the snow were 3 very, very large humanoid footprints.  We couldn''t figure out where they came from or where they went.  It literally looked as it came from no where and went no where, because the footprints did not leave a trail.  The footprints were so large I could almost stand in it.  You could literally see the 5 toes with foot and toe imprints in the snow.  We couldn''t believe what we were seeing.  Who or what has a foot that big and who or what would be out in this weather barefooted.<BR><BR>" 1, " April 29 2006 about 630pm I just left the Livingston mall and was heading home but got all turned about since I don''t go up that way very often. Anyhow I was figuring that I was north of rt 78 and just kind of \"Lewis and Clarked\" it toward home via the mirror compass in my car and made the first left southbound that I could once I realized I was heading west and didn''t recognize any landmarks. <BR><BR>I turn down this road and notice some construction equipment not far off into the trees on the right side of the road. I was driving slower than normal being unfarmiliar with the area and since I kept peeking at the compass to make sure I was still southbound (looking back it must have been overcast since I would have just used the location of the sun as a reference to direction).<BR>As I was driving along I caught movement out of the corner of my eye and saw a young deer (judging by size) bolt out of the trees across the road from left to right about 100-200 feet in front of my car. I just took my foot off the gas and didn''t need to brake, then I looked left for followers and saw what appeard to be a hunter in a dark colored ghillie suit burst from the trees after the deer. I couldnt make out any details of the face feet or hands but he/it was only around 6 feet tall or so and I''d estimate the low 200lb range but was unusually fast especially for someone dressed like that. The second thought in my head since I fish and shoot a bit was that it couldn''t possibly be legal to hunt around that area since its fairly close to residential zones. Then I noticed that the hunter had no weapons in his hands. I got up to the spot where they crossed and looked right and noticed that the biped (hunter) actually closed ground on the deer and was still in pursuit. I don''t know if the deer stopped to look back at some point as they some times do but this thing was in a full tilt sprint over what I would assume to be uneven ground and didn''t stumble once. I didn''t hear or smell anything since I had my roof up and AC & radio on at the time.

It was late afternoon when we noticed a strong odor that we thought might be elk so we headed east toward a small ridge hoping to find one on the other side.  As we got closer we heard the noise of rocks being banged together.  As we topped the ridge we saw a large dark brown animal squatting at the edge of a dry creek bed with it''s back toward us. It was banging 2 rocks together with it''s \"hands\" and making a grunting/growling noise each time the  rocks hit.<BR><BR>It seemed to sense our presence almost immediately and turned around and looked at us.  Then it quickly stood up and jumped across the creek in one motion.  I remember thinking \"nothing can move like that!\".  It ran up the slope on the north side of the creek bed at an angle and disappeared into the pine and aspen trees farther up the hill.  We could see it for about 50 feet before it was gone from sight.  It moved real quietly for something that big.<BR><BR>I estimate it''s height as 6''5''''.  It was covered with long dark brown hair that made me think of a yak.  It had a strong smell, at least there was a strong smell in the area that was like elk urine.<BR><BR>After we calmed down a bit, we went into the creek bed and found the 2 rocks which were chipped and broken.  We looked for other signs in that place but couldn''t find anything else." 1, " I was working in the northern part of New Mexico training to be a Wildland Fire Fighter. In September 2003 (maybe the second week of that month) I was dispatched with 22 other people to the Del Loma Fire in the Shasta/Trinity Forest area, the Northern part of California. Each Crew had about 20 people, our plane that left Albuquerque held 2 crews. For almost the whole two weeks, we were all on standby. On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire. It was close to sun down when, a couple of guys were amazed at something. I heard them from inside my tent, but just ignored the whole thing until one of my crew members came and pulled me out of my tent. <BR><BR>I had no idea what I was supposed to be looking at or for. He pointed across the river and I was in shock when he pointed out the biggest, hairiest mammal I had ever seen just walking along the river side minding his own business. It stopped and looked at us. The way he stood on his hind legs was like an ordinary human. He had dark, long hair and stood about 7ft tall with a muscular build. <BR><BR>At this point I was the 4th person standing there in amazement. Maybe about 5 minutes of watching him watch us, with more people coming out with flashlights (because the sun was still going down) he darted in to the trees. He was running, taking long strides, and was gone in about 3 seconds.....and was literally pushing trees out of his way (not breaking them, but  pushing them out of his way). The trees behind him on his path up the mountain were swaying back and forth. I was surprised to see to these trees moving because they are thick in width and very tall. <BR><BR>By this time it was dark but lit enough to see which way he was headed. Up the mountain a little, there was a clearing, where we spotted him again before he disappeared for good. He made no noise, no yelling or screaming. He was just as timid as can be.<BR><BR>I have heard many stories about Bigfoot, and known that they are real but when seeing one in real life....you get a sense of respect for them and just have that feeling that there is more to life than you know. <BR><BR><BR><BR>" 1}, :cardinality 99}, :environment {:data-type "string", :distinct 449, :group-by? true, :commons {nil 41, "Pine forest" 6, "Forest" 3}, :cardinality 89}, :fixed_year {:data-type "string", :distinct 77, :group-by? true, :commons {"2001" 30, "2000" 25, "1998" 23}, :cardinality 15}, :run_time {:data-type "string", :distinct 187, :group-by? true, :commons {"2022-05-20 16:15:54.000000" 4, "2022-05-20 16:15:30.000000" 4, "2022-05-20 16:14:33.000000" 4}, :cardinality 37}}, :rowcount 500}, :albums-drag-571 {:fields {:album_href {:data-type "string", :distinct 25, :group-by? true, :commons {"https://api.spotify.com/v1/albums/0vNBQof86Lv5gLuf26ML7o" 1, "https://api.spotify.com/v1/albums/4ljK2LVKvEPd5xPgUJn0Bs" 1, "https://api.spotify.com/v1/albums/70uejEPPRPSLBrTRdfghP5" 1}, :cardinality 100}, :album_name {:data-type "string", :distinct 25, :group-by? true, :commons {"...And Justice for All (Remastered Deluxe Box Set)" 1, "S&M" 1, "S&M2" 1}, :cardinality 100}, :img_300 {:data-type "string", :distinct 25, :group-by? true, :commons {"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02a49eff6d64cafc2551553380" 1, "https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02e9c415cdc78d53b9b8627274" 1, "https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e022fe08610316f3e5ebaa06d68" 1}, :cardinality 100}, :img_64 {:data-type "string", :distinct 25, :group-by? true, :commons {"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d000048518161357a12a172721e772e0d" 1, "https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d000048517e1f85f69323acac962516c4" 1, "https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d000048512127e0afac383fb73d533a7d" 1}, :cardinality 100}, :img_640 {:data-type "string", :distinct 25, :group-by? true, :commons {"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273a4c3675649cce210651d150d" 1, "https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273f1a501610a71d48c526c7ecd" 1, "https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2730a3eb7ef6df5732fc6fa77ec" 1}, :cardinality 100}, :popularity {:data-type "integer", :distinct 20, :group-by? true, :commons {64 3, 53 2, 57 2}, :cardinality 80}, :release_date {:data-type "string", :distinct 19, :group-by? true, :commons {"1986-03-03" 2, "1983-07-25" 2, "1988-09-07" 2}, :cardinality 75}, :ts {:data-type "string", :distinct 1, :group-by? true, :commons {"2023-09-24 19:19:15" 25}, :cardinality 3}}, :rowcount 25}, :query-7423-clone-908 {:fields {:rowcnt {:data-type "integer", :distinct 1, :group-by? false, :commons {10685 1}, :cardinality 100}}, :rowcount 1}, :rowcnt-drag-797->-rowcnt->-rowcnt {:fields {:duration_seconds_int {:data-type "integer", :distinct 17, :group-by? true, :commons {600 6, 5 5, 300 3}, :cardinality 50}, :comments {:data-type "string", :distinct 34, :group-by? true, :commons {"2 UFO&#39s sighted abover chevron island Goldcoast Queensland Australia  500 Lights On Object0: Yes" 1, "it was the scariest thing i&#39d ever seen." 1, "OK&#44 this&#44 I&#39m sure wasn&#39t a UFO - but I found a link&#44 and I thought I&#39d share it anyway...

Anyhow I was figuring that I was north of rt 78 and just kind of \"Lewis and Clarked\" it toward home via the mirror compass in my car and made the first left southbound that I could once I realized I was heading west and didn''t recognize any landmarks. <BR><BR>I turn down this road and notice some construction equipment not far off into the trees on the right side of the road. I was driving slower than normal being unfarmiliar with the area and since I kept peeking at the compass to make sure I was still southbound (looking back it must have been overcast since I would have just used the location of the sun as a reference to direction).<BR>As I was driving along I caught movement out of the corner of my eye and saw a young deer (judging by size) bolt out of the trees across the road from left to right about 100-200 feet in front of my car. I just took my foot off the gas and didn''t need to brake, then I looked left for followers and saw what appeard to be a hunter in a dark colored ghillie suit burst from the trees after the deer. I couldnt make out any details of the face feet or hands but he/it was only around 6 feet tall or so and I''d estimate the low 200lb range but was unusually fast especially for someone dressed like that. The second thought in my head since I fish and shoot a bit was that it couldn''t possibly be legal to hunt around that area since its fairly close to residential zones. Then I noticed that the hunter had no weapons in his hands. I got up to the spot where they crossed and looked right and noticed that the biped (hunter) actually closed ground on the deer and was still in pursuit. I don''t know if the deer stopped to look back at some point as they some times do but this thing was in a full tilt sprint over what I would assume to be uneven ground and didn''t stumble once. I didn''t hear or smell anything since I had my roof up and AC & radio on at the time. All of this happened I would estimate in less than 20 seconds total." 1, " First of all, we are staying at a park that has a winding deep creek at the back of 16 + acres.. anyway today my grandchildren and their parents came out to the park to see us.  The children''s parents recently bought them 4-wheelers and this is approx. the 4th time they have come to the park to ride them...<BR><BR>Today was just like every other time they have come out to ride them. We drive our vehicles about 1/8 mile away from the actual park grounds and that''s where the kids and adults ride the 4-wheelers.  We all rode back there for hours... We were making alot of noise of course with 3 children and 4 adults.  Even the owner drove back there in his pickup and stayed awhile... All I am saying is there was alot of noise and I had my Jack Russell Terrier, with me.<BR><BR>I came back to the park area along with my husband about 6:30p.m. The kids and their parents continued to stay out there and ride.  I got a call from my son.  He told me that my 7 year old grandson had just encountered some type of large animal.  He said that he wasn''t sure what it was but said it was big and looked sort of like a monkey with long hair all over it and had a bump on it''s head. He said it wasn''t running.  It scared him half to death and he looked behind him at his dad yelled for his help.  My son went on to say that he immediately sped up to where my grandson was and knew immediately something was wrong by the sound of his scream. He immediately got to where my grandson was on the 4-wheeler. He said that it was as if a limb had been pulled way back on a tree and then let go.  It was still moving when he got over there.  His immediate thought was, what is it? First thought was maybe a large dog, but as my grandson began to describe it standing all all fours and yet being as tall as his dad''s chest...dog seemed to be out of the question.   I wondered if there are bears in Oklahoma..  We sort of dismissed it but my grandson kept talking about it.  <BR><BR>You would just have to know this 7 year old.  He doesn''t lie about anything.  You can pretty much always believe him. He is a really calm, good kid who just loves 4-wheelers more than anything in life....<BR><BR>Anyway, we couldn''t figure out what it was and his parents are trying to convince my grandson that whatever it was is gone now.... my grandson  said, \"It looked like Harry on Harry and the Hendersons movie but with a bump on it''s head and it wasn''t standing up. He described it as having long hair all over it''s body.  He said it was the color of his hair(blonde) on part of it and dark too. <BR><BR>Well, late tonight, my husband called my son and told him that he knew of a man in Davis, Oklahoma that had written a book about bigfoot and swears that they are in Oklahoma... It sounded ridiculous until my daughter-in-law typed into a search engine on the internet tonight.. bigfoot sightings in oklahoma..  She began to read about them and that''s when my grandson said, \"that''s what I saw except it wasn''t standing up.<BR><BR>Now it''s got us wondering if whatever my grandson saw today, actually lives there and is upset that we have disturbed it all.<BR><BR>I mean what animal would come that close to all that noise of 4-wheelers and people and cars and a barking Jack Russell dog? It was approx. 7:00pm when this happened today and still light outside.<BR><BR>I don''t know what to make of it except my grandson saw something that scared him bad, so much so that he refuses to do his most favorite thing....ride the 4-wheelers at Papa and Nanas." 1}, :cardinality 98}, :environment {:data-type "string", :distinct 477, :group-by? true, :commons {nil 22, "Forest" 3, "A lot of brush and pricker bushes and fallen trees.

My story of Bigfoot was not visual but rather we heard a scream in the deep forest that we could not explain.  <BR><BR>The location was in the area of Mono Hot Springs, in the Sierra Nevada''s in California, specifically, the John Muir Wilderness.  <BR><BR>My brother friend and I were fishing at Doris Lake near dusk.  Doris Lake is roughly a mile and a half hike from the resort of Mono.  Nothing unusual was happening and then out of nowhere, we heard a scream come from across the lake and up in the Mountians.  There were no people or animals that we could see anywhere.  We were in the proverbial wilderness.  My brother and I looked at each other, and unable to readily discern what we were hearing we continued to fish.  I did say to him, if I hear that again I am out of here. Well, a minute or so later, the same scream.  The three of us immediately reeled in and began to run all the way back to the resort, without stopping.  <BR><BR>I have listened to various recordings of alleged Bigfoot, and I am struck by how similar these recordings are to the scream that we heard.  I did not see anything, so I cant be sure, but I am fairly certian what I heard was not a human, bear or mountian lion.  So....what could it be?<BR><BR>Note:  my brother and sister worked for several years at Mono Hot Springs.  My sisters good friend who worked their as well had a horse which she kept in the summer time at the springs. While riding in the back country, she claims to have seen Bigfoot walking through a meadow below a bluff she was riding atop.

Actually in Fresno. The area is mostly farm land and some sparse woods and vineyards. nothing like foresty though. My self, my cousin and a friend had decided to go late night fishing at a little area on the river where the river sort of pools. Their is a bridge there. It was late and we were sitting there and fishing when we heard something making noise and looked back and saw a coyote running across the bridge heading north. The coyote kept looking back as it ran as if it was frightened.The coyote looked at us but it was clearly focused on something behind it and it was scared. We thought at that time that that was odd. We then heard what we thought was a splash as if someone had dove into the water behind us. It was dark so we just glanced back but of course saw nothing. We probably sat for about 10 minutes or so when suddenly there was a huge goosh and splash about 25 yards away in front of us. We stopped fishing and then tried looking into the darkness.This small boulder throwing continued at least 2 more times before we actually saw a dark figure about 40 yards away standing what looked about waist high in the river. Their was a full moon so it wasn''t to dark to see that it was a pretty big creature. By this time we were starting to get scared and were pretty much froze in place and had began to yell at it, thinking that it could be a person. This prompted my friend to yell threats of violence as young people are sometime prone to do, this creature basically turned it''s whole body to the right of it and grapped another boulder and with both hands over its head it threw it at us, this one landed about 15 yards away. It made no sound or noise only threw small boulders. It threw about 2 more boulders the last landing about 5 yards from us enough to splash water on our faces. By this time we had reeled in our lines and were trying to get out of there as fast as we could. We ran all the way back to the car which was through some trees across a field and up a hill. We went back the next day to the area and on rafts floated to the area where the creature had stood. My friend is about 6 foot tall and jumped in the water to see about how deep it was. The water came to his shoulders. Their was no way this was a man. We even saw some of the boulders that had been thrown at the bottom of the water as it wasn''t more then 5 1/2 feet deep.

While back packing in along the forestry trail leading down to the river, we missed a trail marker and wound up at night along the canyon rim.  We made camp on a bluff slightly below the canyon rim.  I didn''t sleep well that night.  I had a feeling I was being watched and was uneasy. Breaking camp the next morning, Van went for water coming from an artesian spring in the wall of the canyon.  He found one very clear bigfoot footprint in the wet sand below the spring, about 80 feet from where we''d camped.  He called to me to come over and see.  My first reaction was this was a hoax.  Van and I examined the footprint in detail.  It was about 17 inches in length, with 5 clear toes and pressed down about 2 1/2 inches in the sand.  There was a musty smell in the area but this wasn''t overpowering.  Van concluded the print was real based upon the fact it had rained hard the previous morning and you could see the pattern of the rain drops on the surface of the sand except where the footprint was.  Also whatever had the print may very well be slightly above us at the end of the bluff in some rock outcroppings.  He suggested we get out of there while the getting was good.  Van had grown up in Minnesota hunting and fishing with his dad and brothers.  I decided we should take his advice.  We left and back tracked to Van''s Toyota Landcruiser.  We went over to Bass lake to fish for the rest of the weekend.", :environment "This area is around 4500 to 5000 feet in altitude and is covered primarily with conifer forest with some very heavy underbrush in areas. The trails through it are generally good and the terrain is somewhat rocky but passable. A slanted chimney goes down to the bluff which runs parallel to the canyon rim. The bluff is about 200 yards in length and has a few trees, some brush and rock out croppings.
