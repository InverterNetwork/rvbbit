There was snow on the ground and it was freezing outside.  My mother has a habit of looking out the bathroom window early in the morning.  On this cold winter morning, with the landscaped dressed in a blanket of white and without any visible signs of being touched by human or animal footprints, she saw what looked like 3 very large humanoid footprints. It was so strange that my mother made me get up to take a look.  We put our coats on and went outside to investigate.  We couldn''t believe our eyes.  There in the snow were 3 very, very large humanoid footprints.  We couldn''t figure out where they came from or where they went.  It literally looked as it came from no where and went no where, because the footprints did not leave a trail.  The footprints were so large I could almost stand in it.  You could literally see the 5 toes with foot and toe imprints in the snow.  We couldn''t believe what we were seeing.  Who or what has a foot that big and who or what would be out in this weather barefooted.<BR><BR>" 1, " April 29 2006 about 630pm I just left the Livingston mall and was heading home but got all turned about since I don''t go up that way very often. Anyhow I was figuring that I was north of rt 78 and just kind of \"Lewis and Clarked\" it toward home via the mirror compass in my car and made the first left southbound that I could once I realized I was heading west and didn''t recognize any landmarks. <BR><BR>I turn down this road and notice some construction equipment not far off into the trees on the right side of the road. I was driving slower than normal being unfarmiliar with the area and since I kept peeking at the compass to make sure I was still southbound (looking back it must have been overcast since I would have just used the location of the sun as a reference to direction).<BR>As I was driving along I caught movement out of the corner of my eye and saw a young deer (judging by size) bolt out of the trees across the road from left to right about 100-200 feet in front of my car. I just took my foot off the gas and didn''t need to brake, then I looked left for followers and saw what appeard to be a hunter in a dark colored ghillie suit burst from the trees after the deer. I couldnt make out any details of the face feet or hands but he/it was only around 6 feet tall or so and I''d estimate the low 200lb range but was unusually fast especially for someone dressed like that. The second thought in my head since I fish and shoot a bit was that it couldn''t possibly be legal to hunt around that area since its fairly close to residential zones. Then I noticed that the hunter had no weapons in his hands. I got up to the spot where they crossed and looked right and noticed that the biped (hunter) actually closed ground on the deer and was still in pursuit. I don''t know if the deer stopped to look back at some point as they some times do but this thing was in a full tilt sprint over what I would assume to be uneven ground and didn''t stumble once. I didn''t hear or smell anything since I had my roof up and AC & radio on at the time. All of this happened I would estimate in less than 20 seconds total." 1}, :cardinality 99}, :environment {:data-type "string", :distinct 482, :group-by? true, :commons {nil 15, "wooded area" 3, "Mountain ridge" 2}, :cardinality 96}, :fixed_year {:data-type "string", :distinct 66, :group-by?

They followed these tracks for about a half mile until they stopped under an old railroad trestle. Sometime later, they were checking limb lines about 12:30 AM in their boat in the same area. The night was very dark and although they had a flashlight, all it would reveal was the immediate brush along the creek. As they paddled along, they kept hearing something in the brush which they assumed was a deer. A few minutes later, a huge rock came flying downward in front of their boat and hit the water. Whatever it was had to be either human, or a human type of creature. It is unlikely to have been a person since that side of the creek is avoided because of its inaccessability and very heavy brush.   " 1, " In one part of Bearbrook State Park is the Girl Scout Day Camp location. Across the street from New Rye Rd is the Camping Museum & the Snowmobile Museum. There used to be a nature museum. If you keep going straight on that dirt path, you wind yourself up into the Girl Scout Campground. It was a 2 week event. The older campers were allowed to have a single overnight in the last few days. It was ''67/''68, late July. There were 3, 5-person tents, I was a senior and in the tent closest to the woods. The evening was spent cooking hotdogs & hamburgers & marshmallows & sa''mores with lots of singing laughing & screaming. We all retired around 10 pm. In the middle of the night, around 1 or 2 am, I was woken by something softly grunting & pushing down on the top of the tent. We have racoons but no bears in (I get the irony) Bear Brook State Park. The other girls in my tent were trying to stay quiet, but still panicking not so quietly. I said \" it''s just one of the other girls.\" I am a camper since age 9 with a father who was a practical joker. So I said loudly \"That''s not how you do it. This is how it is done\" & I dug my nails into the canvas & making a roaring growling sound clawed down the canvas hard & fast & hit something soft but solid on the outside of the cloth. I was picturing a man''s hand/fist kind of like knuckles???. There was a loud grunt/growl & crashing away from us through the underbrush just on the other side of the tent. Now the girls in my tent are screaming hysterically about bears, The rest of the campers are opening my tent and all pandemonium broke loose. No-one admitted to playing a prank. & the leaders in the other 2 tents all day insisted everyone was accounted for & no one had left the tents not even a potty run. There was a funky smell though, that no-one could recognize. The park rangers swore there were none in the area, they were all up north for the summer. We had never heard of bigfoot, I fear I am repeating myself, so didn''t even know such a thing existed. So, unexplainable incident, that with hindsight, I am thinking, could it have been??? The entire area, for square miles, has always been swarming w/ deer, even still, today." 1, " We were on our long vacation from Missouri, in Crescent City, California, staying at the KOA campground. This was our second night at this campground. We were camped at site 401, way back in the isolated section of the campground, far from anyone. I had just finished cooking our supper on the portable propane barbeque pit, which was located on the picnic table. We both went inside to eat.<BR><BR> During the time I was cooking, I set up a camp fire, but didn''t light it yet. After we finished eating, I started the campfire. After the fire was burning for about 15 minutes, I kicked it into the fire pit from the grate. At that time my wife got a very strong feeling that we were being watched from behind our camper. <BR><BR>She said it seemed to move (the feeling) from behind the trailer, from one end to the other. There were trees, and dense foliage behind the trailer. I started to look around with a flash light to see what it was, and after not finding anything, I started the car and plugged in the 12v spot light. <BR><BR>Looking around for about 5 minutes, I thought I saw something move in the distance, behind a tree. This was in the opposite area from the trailer, where no one was camped at all. We both were shaken up, and went inside the trailer for the night. After 10 minutes my wife heard 2 whoops, coming from the area that I thought I saw something move at. She was in bed lying next to the window. I didn''t hear the sound. <BR><BR>One more thing to add, is that the night before we heard dogs bark in the distance, this night it was all quiet no dogs at all. The closet camper was about 100 feet away towards the main office. There was no smell.<BR>" 1}, :cardinality 100}, :environment {:data-type "string", :distinct 485, :group-by? true, :commons {nil 15, "Pine Forest" 2, "Along the Saint John''s river, I believe there are wooded areas on both sides of the river.

I have been in the process of writing a book on Ape Cave near Mt St Helens. I contacted Jeff Lemley about getting some reports about Bigfoot stories to add to my book. I have kept in close contact with Jeff since the first contact and emailed him immediately after we got back from our trip.<BR><BR>I told my husband, Larry, that I wanted to go camping at Peterson Prairie for my birthday (August 15th) with my twin sister, Vicki and her husband, Jim K. I thought it would be fun to take in a cave or two, time permitting. My husband and I are avid cavers and enjoy spending free time exploring the wild caves of Southern Washington State near Mt St Helens and Mt Adams. We both felt it would be a good time to introduce my sister and her husband (and their toy red Poodle, Sparky) to the sport of wild caving.<BR><BR>The four of us drove our two minivans through the Dark Divide and arrived at camp late in the day on the 14th. Our favorite camp spot was still available so we proceeded to set up camp. As it turned out, my sister and her husband, took the safe way out and set up camp in their Dodge Caravan, while I pitched our miniscule backpacking tent 50 feet South of the camp in a small clearing surrounding by small pines. It was just enough room to pitch a small tent and still be able to tie off the guy ropes to keep the rainfly away from the tent.<BR><BR>As far as I knew, the night was uneventful until my husband spoke up the next morning. Larry told all of us that he thought he heard a Bigfoot howling (my husband is an extreme skeptic when it comes to anything related to Bigfoot). We all talked about it for a while and then decided to get ready to go caving in Cheese Cave, a local lava tube. Later in the day, we rode our bikes to some local caves and then went back to camp. Later, Larry and I left my sister and her husband at camp to rest while we set out to find Dynamite Cave. We drove around all of the dirt roads in the STR that we thought it was supposed to be located in. We parked the van at several locations. At one spot, my husband started walking down a remote trail with me following a short distance behind him. I stopped on the trail not far from the car because I heard something very large run through the bush to my right, just off the trail. My husband kept going, but I was too apprehensive to move. Whatever it was, it was huge; but it didn''t sound like an elk moving through the bush. Also, I felt like something was watching me. It was quite creepy! Since Larry had moved out of sight, I felt very vunerable and literally ran up to catch up with him. I kept telling him I wanted to go back to the car; but didn''t want to go by the one spot alone. He finally relented and we walking briskly to the car.<BR><BR>That night we all walked to the clearing due East of camp, next to the road which led to the group camp to watch the stars and anything else interesting in the clear skies. After turning in about 10PM, we slept soundly until about 3AM, when I was awakened by an incredibly loud howling, unlike anything I had ever heard in my life. Since I am an avid outdoorsperson, I have camped out and seen and heard most of the wild things that occur in the forests and mountains. This was like nothing I had ever heard before. There was absolutely no other sounds from the forest until a Barred Owl responded to the howl. <BR><BR>I woke Larry up to ask him about the howls. He said that it was the very same thing that he heard the night before. We both listened to it banter back and forth with the owl. After maybe 10 to 15 minutes of howling, the owl took off flying North through the trees. We could both hear his wings flapping as he was hooting. He was much closer to us than the thing which was howling; but the howling was much louder than the owl. <BR><BR>What happened next sent chills down my spine. I was laying on my stomach in the tent, needing very much to go outside and relieve myself; but unwilling to venture outside due to the howlings I was still listening to. Larry had fallen back asleep, so unfortunately, the thing I heard next fell on my ears alone. The best I could describe it was a howling turning into an Ape-like chattering. It sounded like someone was practicing phonics by contorting their mouth, while at the same time, reciting all the vowels. That is the best I can describe it. The sounds were incredibly loud and quite frightening sounding. I lay motionless until the sounds died down and I fell asleep.<BR><BR>I was awakened one more time around 6:15 to 6:30 in the morning. Light was already finding its way into camp which I could see through the mosquito netting at the head of our tent. This time I heard a pack of coyotes start up, followed again by that same howling sound. At this point, I was really getting freaked out; but was still not willing to venture out of the tent. As soon as it was light enough, I got up and ran to my sister''s van. I rapped on their window and asked if they heard the howls. Of course, they hadn''t heard anything; but were quite interested in what Larry and I had heard that night.<BR><BR>When I got home, I emailed Jeff Lemley to see if he had any wave files to listen to that might sound like what we heard. I listened to every owl sound on the web and nothing sounded like what we heard. A few days later, I got an email from Jeff about the other report four days before ours, only 6 miles North of us. As I told Jeff, both my husband and I would like to think that the sounds we heard were in fact, Barred Owls. Anyone sleeping in a flimsy nylon tent would probably convince themselves of the same.

This is a relatively rural area, with large expanses of forested land, just west of the Massachusetts and Vermont state lines. About 1 mile from our home we came around a bend in the road where another road, Davitts Lake Rd, intersects the road we were traveling, Blue Factory Hill Rd., and forms a \"T\".  At this \"T\" there is a street light, and opposite Davitts Lake Rd, on the other side of Blue Factory Hill Rd. (the road we were on), is a 4-5 foot embankment sloping away from the shoulder of the road to a large field, also sloping downward from the road and ending at a line of trees approx. 100 yards from the road. There was (and still is) a barb wire fence which runs parallel to Blue<BR>Factory Hill Rd. along this 4-5 foot embankment, <BR>with the fence post set halfway down the embankment so that the top wire of the fence is about the same heigth or perhaps slightly higher than the shoulder of the road. <BR><BR>It is at this location at the abovementioned time, under the<BR>illumination of the street light that I clearly saw a figure in mid stride hurdling over the barbwire fence, whose body was completely covered with red colored hair, not unlike the color of a red fox. The hair on my neck tingled, as while I<BR>was certain of what I was seeing, my mind was<BR>coming up blank as to any reference of what it actually was, and I felt a sudden rush of fear. I said to my wife \" what the hell was that\", and as our vehicle drew near the spot where I first spotted the figure, I could not draw myself to stop the vehicle, or even look in the direction of the field on my left where the figure was running.<BR><BR>Using the telephone pole from which the street light is mounted as a point of reference, I would estimate this figure to stand approx. 7-8 feet tall, and was totally human-like in respect to moving upright. <BR><BR>At this point I will turn the report over to my wife who watched this figure run down the field.<BR><BR>I did not see the figure leaping over the barbed wire fence - but I did see it running through the field.  It was very large, covered in red hair as my husband described and running in an upright position swinging it''s \"arms\" back and forth as it ran.  I knew it wasn''t a bear or deer - and as I watched it disappear into the wooded area, I had goosebumps on my neck and knew I had just seen something which was very unusual.<BR><BR>This event occured several years ago, actually<BR>back in 1988. Naturally we have been reluctant to<BR>share our encounter, as when doing so with even<BR>our closest friends, we are met with comments such as basically we''re nuts, seeing things, or it was surely a bear or deer. But we do not know either to be able to run upright like a human!<BR><BR>So--- having found this website we guess it''s time to report this, as after viewing some TV programs about \"bigfoot\", the only illogical logical conclusion we can come to is that our<BR>red haired figure was in fact a bigfoot, and since we saw this, they must exist, for we are both absolutely certain of the description of what we saw.<BR>", :environment "The forest is mixed with red and white oak and maple the predominant tree species.

AZ.<BR><BR>09/24/09, 11:30 p.m. My wife and I were sitting in our bedroom with the bedroom window open, we were working on papers for our personal budget when we heard a howl that lasted for quite some time, this occurred several times within a 5 minute time frame. The sound was so out of the ordinary that both my wife and I stopped what we were doing and looked out the window and listened to the howl. Both my wife and I have heard many animals from enjoying the outdoors such as elk, coyotes, deer, and bear, but this howl we could not place. When the howls ocurred the dogs in the neighborhood all started barking. The howls seemed to be coming from quite a distance but they were still very noticable. We live in a quiet rural neighborhood where the elevation is approxiametly 6000'' with lots of pine, oak, juniper, and lots of  brush. If I were to guess at where the sounds were coming from I would guess from a higher elevation, but not sure. Several days later I had remembered hearing about your web-site and remembered the sound potion of it, so my wife and I listened to the sound tracks and feel that the howls on your web-site and the howls we heard sounded eerily similar.
