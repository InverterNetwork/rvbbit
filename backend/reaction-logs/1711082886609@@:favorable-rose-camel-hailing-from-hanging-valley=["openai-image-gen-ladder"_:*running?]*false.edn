  "A 16:9 image packed with hyperrealistic and vivid details of a New England town in America, just minutes before sunrise during a hefty snowstorm. This unique portrayal blends the conventional rural aesthetics with cyberpunk influences, resulting in a gently gritty ambiance. The town is covered in a thick layer of snow, with buildings glowing with soft pink and neon blue lights. Dominating the left side of the frame is an Irish woman in her early 30s, with a voluptuous and robust figure. Her captivating facial features include full lips, a slightly tilted nose, and a large warm smile. Long hair, slightly damp with accumulated snow, and intricate Celtic-style tattoos of rabbits and wilderness gracing her neck, collarbone, and shoulders add to her mysterious allure. The enchanting pre-dawn light weaves a serene yet eerie atmosphere around the scene, underscoring the harmony between nature and technology. As the sun slowly ascends, its radiant light casts an angelic glow over the woman's figure. She wears a choker ribbon and a long necklace, adding a touch of burlesque to her appearance.",
